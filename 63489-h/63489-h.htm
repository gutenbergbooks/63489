<p>If there is a region in the world which constrains its inhabitants to
adopt a particular mode of life, that country is Arabia and the regions that
border it on the north, the Sinaitic peninsula and the Syrian and Mesopotamian
deserts. The great majority of the dwellers in these parts are
forced to lead a nomadic life by the fact that the spots in which agriculture
is possible are comparatively rare, and the infrequent rains, which only extend
over limited areas, provide pasture for their flocks now in one part and
now in another, but never for any length of time. The whole character of
the Bedouin is conditioned by this nomadic mode of life (full of hardships
and privations, though not laborious) with its constant struggles with competitors
for the prime necessaries of life. The inhabitants of the oases,
who are permanently settled in favoured spots, differ from the Bedouins in
many respects, but are nevertheless strongly influenced by Bedouin modes
of life and thought. Throughout this vast area life runs its course in perpetual
change, yet remains in essentials ever the same. If one tribe perishes,
migrates elsewhere, or turns to agricultural pursuits somewhere in the
vicinity of the desert, its place is taken by another, which lives exactly as
it had lived. The course of history, however, has shown that intellectual
forces were existent in this desert race which seem to be lacking in others
living under precisely similar conditions, such as the Berbers of the Sahara.</p>

<h4>ARABS PAST AND PRESENT</h4>

<p>We have no certain knowledge of the relation in which the Semitic
tribes of the desert, whom we first meet with in the Old Testament (Ishmaelites,
Midianites, etc.), and who there appear as closely akin to the
Israelites, stand to the Arabs of later times. As far as we can tell, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
they resemble them exactly. The son of the desert likes to reap where he
has not sown; he not only plunders the camels and smaller cattle of alien
tribes of Bedouins, but he devours the cornfields of the peasants who dwell
on the borders of the desert whenever he has a chance, or carries off the
garnered fruits of their toil. Thus in old days the desert tribes on one
occasion actually came across the Jordan into central Palestine and utterly
despoiled the inhabitants, until the latter under the leadership of Gideon
drove them forth and inflicted a severe humiliation upon them (Judges 6-8).
Somewhat later a horde of Amalekite inhabitants of the Sinaitic peninsula
invaded southern Judea and Philistia, but were severely chastised by David,
who was living there in exile (1 Samuel xxx). Such tribes have often in like
manner proved extremely troublesome to the agricultural population on the
margin of the desert. But if the states to which these peasants belong will
only put forth a certain amount of exertion in defence of their territory the
danger is not serious; for at heart the Bedouins are not eminently brave.
In many cases peasants who will protect their own property can successfully
ward off these predatory incursions. The non-nomadic settlers in the
interior of Arabia, in particular, seem invariably to have been more valiant
than the nomadic tribes. The latter would find it hard to do without the
produce of agriculture and date-palm culture, while the dwellers in the
oases, if they desire to have any intercourse with other regions, are obliged
to keep on a friendly footing with the Bedouins through whose haunts their
trade routes lead. Hence treaties are concluded in the interests of both
parties, and the true Arab is an observer of treaties.</p>

<p>By a lamentable process of events it has come to pass that the nomads
have extended their domain considerably at the expense of the husbandman.
Even in Palestine the Bedouin tent-dweller now pastures his camels in
many spots where formerly the Israelite farmer sat under his own vine and
his own fig-tree and tilled his land with ox and ass.</p>

<h4>THE NAME OF ARAB</h4>

<p>The real meaning of the name “Arab” seems to be “desert.” It is first
met with, or so it seems, in varying forms in Assyrian inscriptions of the
ninth century.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the Old Testament it cannot be identified with certainty
before the time of Jeremiah.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In the inscriptions of King Darius Hystaspes,
Arabaya appears to mean the Mesopotamian, Syrian, and Sinaitic desert.
Amongst the Greeks we meet with the terms “Arab, Arabia” first in
Æschylus (<i>Persians</i> 316; <i>Prom.</i> 422), but the poet’s ideas of the situation of
the country are altogether mythical. Herodotus, on the contrary, is fully
conversant with it; he is specially interested in that district, populated by
Arabs, that constitutes the connection between Palestine and Egypt which
was of such importance to the Persian kingdom, and not to it alone. His
contemporary, Nehemiah, is quite familiar with the name of “Arab” (Ch.
2, 19; 4, 7; 6, 16) and so is Xenophon. The latter uses the name “Arabia”
of the Mesopotamian desert in particular (<i>Anab.</i> 1, 5, 1); and this very
region is called “Arab” pure and simple by the later Syrians. The name
has survived from that day to this, especially amongst the people themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
It has long stood for both the nationality and the language. It is true
that even in times tolerably remote Arab was understood to mean more
particularly Bedouin; as is the case even in Sabæan inscriptions. The
latter are, however, more exactly distinguished from the settled inhabitants
of the country by the use of the plural, in its old form <i>A’rab</i>, later more frequently
<i>Orban</i>.</p>

<p>Many scholars assume that all civilised Semitic nations actually took
their rise from Arabia and are, as Sprenger<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> phrases it “Bedouin deposits”
(“<i>abgelagerte Beduinen</i>”). The question of whether, in the last resort,
Arabia was the original home of the Semites or whether they migrated thither
from Africa in primitive times is not affected by this assumption.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In any
case the language of the Hebrews and Aramæans still bears traces of the fact
that their forefathers were at one time a nomadic race, which (with regard
to the former at least) is to some extent confirmed by Old Testament tradition.
It is true that wherever we have any historic record the contrast between
these civilised peoples and the dwellers in the desert is evident. But
we can imagine that the same thing happened with them as we may observe
repeatedly in Arab tribes of later days. They press forward, gradually in
part and in part rapidly, out of Arabia proper. The Syrian and Mesopotamian
deserts, barren as they seem to us, offer the nomads certain advantages
over the regions to the south. The rainfall is somewhat more copious. The
nomads come into closer contact with settled peoples, and much as the
Bedouin (proud of his freedom and happy in his leisure) may look down upon
the industrious peasant and even upon the artisan, yet the greater security
and the certainty of obtaining daily food prompts him to take to husbandry
in the region of verdure when opportunity offers. The process was sometimes
accompanied by violence towards the earlier settlers, but it often came
about peaceably. Thus one wave of Arabs slowly overtook another. The
names which predominate in the older portions of the Old Testament (Ishmaelites,
Midianites, etc.) soon fall into the background. The appearance of the
name “Arab” may be in itself an indication of the arrival of fresh tribes in
these regions.</p>

<h4>THE ARABS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS</h4>

<p>In the fourth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> we find the Arab tribe of the Nabatæans to the
south of Palestine, and the same tribe soon afterwards formed a settled state
which extended eastwards from the ancient territory of Israel as far as to
Damascus, rose to a considerable height of civilisation, and maintained a position
of lax dependence upon Rome until Trajan destroyed it in the year 106;
certainly not to the real advantage of the empire. In the first century of
our era we meet with princes and nobles with Arabic names in Edessa,
Palmyra, Emesa, and Hatrá. The abundant store of inscriptions at Palmyra
shows that the greater part of the population of this Aramaic-speaking trading
city, encompassed on all sides by the desert, was of Arab origin. It seems
that during the gradual decay of the Seleucid kingdom, Arabs in several cases
acquired dominion over these districts, just as at a later period members of
various Bedouin tribes rose to eminence in Syria and Mesopotamia, during the
decadence of the caliphate dynasty. Thus numerous settled Arab tribes lived
in many parts of Syria as Roman subjects. In process of time all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Arabs who dwelt in towns or villages grew to be Aramæans; even before
that they had always used the Aramaic language in their inscriptions&mdash;where
they did not write in Greek&mdash;because Arabic was not then regarded as a
suitable language for use in writing.</p>

<p>At this time two new names for the Arabs came into existence, “Saracens”
and “Taits.” Ptolemy (5, 16) mentions Σαρακηνή as a district in the Sinaitic
peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The inhabitants of this district, who are unknown to Arab
tradition, must have made themselves notorious in the Roman provinces in
their vicinity; we can hardly suppose by other means than predatory incursions
by hindering the march of caravans or levying heavy tolls upon them.
Thus in that region all Bedouins came to be called Saraceni (Σαρακηνοί), in
Aramaic Sarkaje, usually with no very favourable meaning. We meet with
the latter form in a dialogue concerning Fate, written about 210 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> by a
pupil of Bardesanes.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The designation then became general; thus it occurs
very frequently in Ammianus Marcellinus. The name “Saracen” continued
to be used in the West in later times probably rather through the
influence of literature than by oral tradition, and was applied to all Arabs,
and even to all Moslems, without distinction.</p>

<p>In precisely the same fashion and at exactly the same time the designation
“Taits” came to be used for all Arabs by the Syrians of Edessa and the inhabitants
of Babylonia. Only, while we know nothing of a distinct tribe of
Saracens, which must very early have ceased to exist as such, we have plentiful
and trustworthy information concerning the Tai in Arab literature.
Their principal seat was in northern Nejd, but they spread abroad in many
directions. Even now their name has not wholly passed out of remembrance.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
By degrees the Aramæans came to style all Arabs “Tayaye,” and
the Persians adopted the name from them.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Amongst the latter it is pronounced
Tadjik, Tazik, in its more ancient form (with the Persian suffix),
and Tazi in the later form.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Arabs themselves reckon the Tai among
the tribes which were once settled in the south of the Arabian peninsula.
We are probably right in connecting their appearance in the north with a
fresh wave which carried quite a number of the tribes of south Arabia into
the northern districts; a tribal migration of which Arab tradition has much
to tell, and some of it authentic.</p>

<p>The Arabs were known at that period only as a wholly savage race. Ammianus
says of them: “<i>natio perniciosa</i>” (14, 4, 7), “<i>nec amici nobis unquam
nec hostes optandi</i>” (14, 4, 1). The whole description, which he gives from
contemporary information (14, 4), is very instructive, though somewhat one-sided
and exaggerated in certain particulars. When he says that the Saracens
live upon flesh and milk, and that most of them are unacquainted with
wheat or wine, the statement agrees with that in the not much later Syrian
<i>Vita</i> of Simeon Stylites<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that many “Taits” did not know what bread was,
but lived entirely upon flesh. There can be no question that the northern
Bedouins, the only ones the author had in mind, can seldom have had an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
opportunity of procuring dates. Bread is an article of luxury in Arabia
even at the present time. The Bedouins of the Sinaitic district, with whom
S. Nilus (fifth century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) had to do, were quite exceptionally barbarous.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h4>ARAB CIVILISATION</h4>

<p>We have hitherto completely ignored the seats of higher civilisation
which were to be found in ancient times in the peninsula of Arabia. As
early as the second millennium <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> southwest Arabia, the Yemen, the country
of the Sabæans and Himyars, which was well adapted for agriculture on
account of the regular rains of its tropical summer, had developed a civilisation
which has left, in the ruins of huge buildings and numerous inscriptions,
monuments which still excite our admiration. The Greeks and Romans were
not without justification when they spoke of a εὐδαίμων Ἀραβία, Arabia
Felix, though their ideas of the character and extent of this “rich”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> country
were for the most part tolerably vague.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But several passages in the Old
Testament bear witness to the high repute of the glory and splendour of the
Sabæans. This is particularly evident in the legend of the queen of Sheba’s
visit to Solomon (1 Kings x, 1-10). Not the least part of the wealth of the
Sabæans was due to their monopoly of the trade in certain fragrant substances,
especially in the incense which in old times was used in immense quantities
at sacrifices. These perfumes, especially incense, are mentioned in various
passages of the Old Testament, together with gold and precious stones, as
amongst the treasures of the Sabæans (1 Kings x, 2, 10; Jeremiah vi, 20;
Ezekiel xxvii, 22; Isaiah lx, 6). These and other products were carried to
the north by Sabæan caravans (cf. Isaiah lx, 6; Tobit vi, 16). In the inscriptions
of northern Hijaz we now have documentary evidence to prove that the
Sabæans established permanent trading-stations at a distance from their own
country. At the height of their prosperity they must have exercised a civilising
influence of no mean importance upon the rest of Arabia, especially upon
those parts of the west which they traversed in their regular journeys. To
them the Thamudæans, with whose buildings (known before only by the report
of Arab writers) the labours of Doughty and Euting have made us acquainted,
and the Nabatæans, who were closely connected with the Thamudæans, probably
owed the first elements of their culture. Written characters, which came
to the Sabæans from the north in very early days, were by them disseminated
in every kind of transmutation over large portions of Arabia, as far as the
neighbourhood of Damascus on the one hand and Abyssinia on the other.
Nevertheless, take it all in all, the civilisation of the ancient Yemen bore
little fruit for the world beyond. The countries about the Mediterranean
received no intellectual stimulus worth speaking of from this remote region,
nor did the old Semitic civilisation, nor Iran, receive more. And since the
glory of the land of the Sabæans has departed its influence on other Arabs
has become insignificant.</p>

<p>The decadence of the nation was probably due to various causes. It is
certain that the Arab tradition which sees in it the effect of a single catastrophe&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
bursting of the dam at Marib, which was indispensable for regular
irrigation&mdash;is far from being an adequate explanation. The bursting of
the dam must itself have been the consequence of neglect on the part of a
degenerate race. But there may well be some truth in the tradition, which
connects the decline of this remarkable people, indirectly, at least, with the
great migration of Yemenite tribes to the north. At that time&mdash;about the
second century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>&mdash;a kind of retrograde movement seems to have set in
throughout the civilisation of a large part of Arabia. At certain periods
large numbers of Arabs had been able to write, at least in rude characters,
as is sufficiently proved by numerous brief inscriptions; about the year 600
the art of writing in Arabia was the secret of the few. Even in Yemen tolerably
trustworthy traditions of its palmy days survived only amongst individuals.
The conquest of the country by the hated Abyssinians (525 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
probably shattered the last remnants of national vigour, and the Persian conquest
(about 570 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) failed to quicken it afresh. It is true that the
civilisation of Yemen was still superior to that of the rest of Arabia; for
example, it carried on a fairly important manufacture of weapons and materials
for garments. A dim consciousness still survived of great things that
the country had wrought. But, since there were no historic records of such,
the later Yemenites endeavoured to vindicate the fame of their forefathers
by extravagant inventions and to show that they had done far greater deeds
than were done by the Koreishites at the head of the Moslems.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the fact remains that the civilisation of the Sabæans need
scarcely be taken into account in determining the place of Arabia in history.
It counts for less than the inferior civilisation of other nations less remote
from the main theatre of events. The principal scene of the old quarrel
of East and West, which had presented itself so vividly to the eyes of the
Greeks in the Persian wars, in the last century before Christ was transferred
to Syria and the countries about the Euphrates and Tigris. The Arabs of
the northern districts were drawn into the struggle of the Romans with the
Parthians and Persians. They were always available for pillaging the enemy’s
territory or harassing their compatriots on the other side. It was hardly
possible for the great powers to rule the desert, and it would have been
a somewhat thankless task; but they could influence the Bedouins strongly
by various indirect methods. The Arab dynasties in the frontier districts
were particularly useful for the purpose; they occupied a position of independence
none too strict, and were invariably regarded with suspicion, but
they could keep their savage kinsmen, with whom they were constantly in
touch, far more effectually in check than regular imperial or royal officials
could have done.</p>

<p>In this connection the Christian phylarchs of the tribe of Ghassan
are worthy of special mention on the Roman side. Their capital was not
far from Damascus and they played a somewhat important part in the events
of the sixth century. On the Persian side there were for many years the
vassal kings of the tribe of Lakhm, which dwelt in the important city of
Hira, near the ancient Babylon. Both dynasties were respected and feared
nearly as far as the confines of Arabia. Some scattered monarchies had likewise
arisen in the interior of the country. In particular, we know of some
sovereigns of a family of the Kinda tribe, whose home was at Hadramaut,
far to the south; they ruled with vigour in various parts of Arabia, much
like the princes of the Haïl dynasty at the present day.</p>

<p>But this sovereignty was of no long duration. Arabia is not suited to
monarchy. The Bedouin has too strong a taste for independence; he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
averse even from peaceful enterprises for his own profit, if they call for discipline
and subordination. A government must be equally wise and firm
if it is to control the intractable nomad, with his loose ties to the soil. The
Bedouin clings to his family, his tribe, his race. He yields willingly to the
suggestions of the most distinguished and experienced chiefs of his tribe, but
only so far as he pleases. There can be no question of a real government
authority. This was the case even in the few cities of the interior. The
decisions of the heads of families had considerable weight, but no coercive
force. It might happen that individuals or families held aloof from a campaign
undertaken on the initiative of the most distinguished men of the
tribe, or turned back before its object was attained, nor could any one prevent
them from so doing. They would perhaps have to endure scorn and
mockery in prose and verse, and to that the true Arab is as sensitive as he
is accessible to hyperbolical eulogy. In Arabia, then as now, peace never
prevailed for any length of time. Sometimes there were feuds between
large tribes or groups of tribes, sometimes quarrels within narrower limits.
Camel-lifting and the use of pasture and wells belonging to another tribe
constituted frequent grounds of quarrel. If blood were shed (which usually
happened unintentionally) it cried aloud for blood. The Arab is not
naturally blood-thirsty, but the passion of revenge for his slaughtered kin
can lash him to furious blood-thirstiness. Fear of blood-revenge and the
reflection that, in the peace which must ultimately be concluded, wergild
must be paid to the tribe that has suffered most severely, in proportion to its
losses, usually induce the combatants to be careful not to slay too many
enemies, even in the stricken field. A murder or even a grievous injury
may provoke long years of feud between families closely akin.</p>

<p>A powerful corrective to lawlessness is, however, supplied by the sway
of custom and tradition. Authority (as has been intimated before) makes
up to a great extent for the lack of political restraints. Authority of this
character tells most strongly amongst a people of the aristocratic temper
which the Arabs share with other nomadic races. An alien has no natural
rights, but if any member of the tribe takes him under his protection he
gains that of the whole tribe, and consequently security for his life and
property.</p>

<h4>THE KOREISH OF MECCA</h4>

<p>By the year 600, and probably a considerable time before, the Koreish
of Mecca had attained a curious and exceptional position. There, in an
absolutely barren valley and near a spring of brackish water, a sanctuary
stood. Some families of the Fihr clan, which belonged to the Bedouin tribe
of Kinana, had settled round about it and established, under the name of
Koreish, a lax commonwealth of the kind frequently found in Arabia. A
considerable area in the immediate vicinity of their sanctuary may possibly
have been respected as holy ground, in which no blood was to be shed, long
before the Koreish took possession of it. Thus secured from harm, and
held in high esteem as the guardians of the Kaaba (a small, square primitive
house enclosed within a building open to the sky), the Koreish had
turned their attention to commerce. They sent forth their caravans far
and wide, as the Ishmaelites and Sabæans had done of old.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Koreishites
travelled as merchants to Gaza, Jerusalem, and Damascus, to Hira on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Euphrates, to Sana in Yemen, and even crossed the Red Sea to Abyssinia.
By these means they not only acquired considerable wealth according to
Arab standards, but what was of much greater value&mdash;a wider mental horizon
than the Bedouins and the inhabitants of the oases, and a knowledge of
men and affairs. Although they never quite attained a regular political
organisation, yet Wellhausen is right when he says, “We note something
of an aristocratic hereditary wisdom, as in the case of ancient Rome and
Venice.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>One consequence, it must be owned, of the practical temper and sober-mindedness
of the Koreish was that they produced no poet of any note, while
each and all of the poverty-stricken tribes of Bedouins about them had great
achievements in this field to show. Better fed than the Bedouins (though
by no means luxuriously) and not decimated by conflicts, they increased
more rapidly in numbers, and in Arabia the numerical strength of a tribe has
much to do with the esteem in which it is held. Their prosperity allowed
them to exercise a liberal hospitality, and the hungry Bedouin appreciates
highly the host who lets him for once eat his fill. We may well conjecture
that it was the Koreish who established the connection between the annual
pilgrimage to the mountain of Arafat, which lay just beyond their holy
ground and the valley of Mina, with the temple of Mecca, which lay within
it. Thus Mecca became the place where Arabs of the most diverse tribes
met together from far and near every year. Even before the days of Islam
the Koreish tribe was held in high esteem far and wide. But, however
much we may study the causes which raised them above other Arabs, it still
remains something of an enigma that this torrid and barren eyrie should at
that time have brought forth so large a number of men, exclusive of the
prophet, who, when their turn came to be placed in circumstances wholly
unfamiliar, acquitted themselves magnificently as generals and statesmen.
History sets us several problems of a similar nature in the sudden appearance
of many notable men at the same spot.</p>

<p>At that time there were many survivals of barbarism among the inhabitants
of central Arabia. For instance, the practice of burying newborn
daughters alive was very general. The cost of feeding and bringing up
girls in that inhospitable country was a burden unwillingly borne; probably
the horrible manner in which they were got rid of had originally some connection
with religious ideas. In remote antiquity the Semites, like many
other nations, reckoned consanguinity only by the surest guarantee, that of
a common mother. Among the Arabs and other peoples we find a relic of
this view, otherwise abandoned long since, in the fact that a man might
regard his stepmother as part of his inheritance and take her to wife. The
father of the great Omar was the issue of such a marriage.</p>

<h4>ARAB POETRY</h4>

<p>Nevertheless we cannot but observe a distinct intellectual advance among
the Arabs of the period we are now considering. This is specially marked
in the efflorescence of poetry. It is of a purely national character and
differs wholly from the poetry of northern Semitic races both in structure
and substance. We know it only in its fully developed form, the oldest
poems which have come down to us in tolerable preservation are of precisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the same character as the later ones, but even they only date back to the
first half of the sixth century at farthest. All Arabic poetry is rhymed,
and rhyme predominates even in certain solemn modes of speech not subject
to strict metrical rule, such as the apothegms of soothsayers. Now, seeing
that this form of poetry, up to that time everywhere unknown, springs into
prominence in Latin and Greek poems of a popular and devotional character
after the fourth century, we are led to conjecture that there may be a connection
of some sort with occidental poetry in the employment of this artistic
method, which may very well have come into use among the Arabs about
the same time. The point of common origin might be Palestine or Syria.
Rhymed prose was probably the original form. The whole matter is, however,
beyond proof.</p>

<p>The acceptance of this conjecture would not impair the originality of
Arabic poetry. Among its great merits is the extremely fine feeling for
rhythm which the entirely illiterate Arab authors of these poems and of the
rhapsodies which were handed down orally display, by the careful observance
of metres which carry out the principle of quantity far more strictly than
those of Greek and Latin poetry. In substance these poems generally turn
upon the ordinary subjects and interests of Bedouin life, though frequently
idealising them; and loftier thoughts are not seldom conspicuous. Some
famous poets who took long journeys, sometimes living among Christian surroundings
at the courts of Arab vassal kings, sometimes going as far as to
Yemen, prepared the way for Islam by disseminating ideas tinged with Christian
thought. The spirit that animates the noble tales of Arab heroes and
worthies which originated at this time points to an advance in culture. One
singular institution appears to have had very advantageous results; during
certain months all heathen Arabs observed a truce of God, in which arms
were laid aside and no blood was shed. During this period friends and foes
met together at certain times and places, originally, no doubt, to celebrate
religious rites. By degrees, however, the latter receded into the background;
negotiations were carried on, treaties concluded, the poets found an audience,
merriment and brisk traffic were the order of the day. Even in the festival
at Mecca, which retained more of its religious character, the varied programme
ran its round.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h4>RELIGION OF THE ANCIENT ARABS</h4>

<p>Concerning the religion of the ancient Arabs we have no great amount
of knowledge. Wellhausen rightly entitles his admirable work on the
subject <i>Reste arabischen Heidenthums</i>. Nevertheless we can make certain
of some points of special importance with regard to our present consideration.
The heathen Arabs possessed many holy places and many ceremonial
rites, but very little earnest religious conviction. Excessively conservative
by nature, the people observed the customs of their fathers without troubling
their minds about their original significance, offered sacrifices to the gods
(rude stone fetiches for the most part), and marched in procession round
their sanctuaries, without counting much upon their aid or standing in any
great awe of them; they cried to the dead, “Be not far from us,” without
associating with the cry the idea of a future life which alone gave it meaning.
In the north the savage king Mundhir ben Ma-assama (505-554) still
sacrificed multitudes of Christian captives in honour of the goddess of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
planet Venus, even as the Israelites had done long ago in honour of their
God.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula likewise offered human sacrifices
to the planet Venus,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and we have other accounts of similar human
sacrifices among the Arabs of the north. Possibly their close contact with
Christians and the adherents of other superior religions may have to some
extent revived the old Semitic religious zeal and fanaticism among the Arabs
there. Farther south we find only faint traces of human sacrifice and we
may regard it as practically extinct by the time of Mohammed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the Arabs who had entered into closer relations
with the Roman Empire, and the majority of those who occupied a like
position towards Persia, had adopted at least a superficial form of Christianity.
There were also some Christians in the interior of Arabia, while in the south
Christianity had long since gained a considerable following. It had been
persecuted for a while by a Jewish ruler; it was ultimately delivered by the
Abyssinian conquest, but had made small progress since then. Christianity
as practised by the Syrians, or, worse still, the Abyssinians, was not well
adapted to win proselytes among the Arabs. If only the disciplined
strength of Rome had acted upon these regions the case would probably
have been different. There were Jews here and there in Arabia, and like the
Jews of Abyssinia most of them seem not to have been genuine children of
Israel, but native converts to Judaism. The Arab Jews, though possessed of
no great theological knowledge, adhered strictly to their religion. The
majority of Arabs was composed of heathen who had outgrown their
religion. There were probably men who were conscious of the defects of
this state of things, and recognised that the Christians had in many points
an advantage over the heathen. We are told of certain persons from Mecca
and its vicinity who adopted, and even preached, a monotheistic faith more
or less Christian, but the details are very obscure. Certainly at the beginning
of the seventh century not even the profoundest and acutest observer
could have foreseen that in the heart of Arabia a religion was soon to arise
and to result in the establishment of an Arab empire destined to give new
shape to vast regions of the world, including the countries which had been
the homes of the oldest civilisations.</p>

<h4>MOHAMMED</h4>

<p>The man whose energy gave clear and practical expression to the obscure
impulse towards a purer religion arose amidst the worldly-wise Koreish.
Flouted at first by his sober-minded fellow tribesmen, he gradually won the
victory for his faith, and died the temporal and spiritual ruler of Arabia.
To the very combination of qualities to some extent contradictory in his
character, he owed his success with such a race as this. He firmly believed
in his mission and was unscrupulous in his choice of means; he was a cataleptic
visionary, and a great statesman; steadfast in his fundamental convictions
and often weak and vacillating in details, he had great practical sagacity
and was incapable of keen logical abstraction; he had a bias towards asceticism
and a temperament strongly sensuous.</p>

<p>We not only have the fullest accounts of Mohammed’s whole character, but
we possess his authentic work, the <i>Koran</i>, which he preached in the name of
his God; and yet the extraordinary, attractive, and repulsive man remains in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
many respects an enigma. He had come across much of Judaism and Christianity,
but by verbal report only. For though it remains an open question
whether Mohammed was actually ignorant of reading and writing, it is
certain that he had neither read the Bible nor any other books. The persons
from whom he gathered his information concerning the older monotheistic
religions must have been somewhat unlettered folk. This holds good
of his Christian instructors more particularly. Certain Judæo-Christian
ideas, however, had early laid powerful hold upon him; resurrection, judgment,
heaven and hell, strict monotheism and the vanity and culpability of
all forms of idolatry. Feeling in himself the divine call, he uttered the
thought that possessed him as the word of God; that which the prophets of
Israel had done in exceptional cases became with him the set form of his
teaching. We may be but ill pleased with the grossness of imagination, the
lack of logic, the undeniable poverty of thought, and much besides in the
<i>Koran</i>, but this was not the effect it wrought upon his hearers, especially
when once their attention had been riveted. It was all new to them, they
were thrilled with terror and delight by those gross representations of hell
and heaven, to these naïve people the weakness of the reasoning was not
apparent, while the strenuousness of assertion took full effect. Moreover
they heard only scattered fragments at a time. The revelation of the <i>Koran</i>
was accomplished gradually, it extended over a period of more than twenty
years, and thus the monotony that repels us was not realised.</p>

<p>But, as has already been said, Mohammed met with small success in his
native town, although he was joined by some of the best and most earnest-minded
men, like Saad ben Abi Wakkas and Omar. It was not until he took
a step unprecedented among the Arabs, and, abandoning his own tribe,
migrated with his handful of Meccan followers to dwell among the inhabitants
of Yathreb, that he gained a firm footing. The latter, palm-dressers
and husbandmen, were a vigorous race, but not intellectually equal to the
Koreish. They had given proof of their valour chiefly by perpetual civil
broils between the two clans of which they consisted. Through their Jewish
neighbours they were at least superficially acquainted with many of the
religious ideas with which Mohammed was occupied. The prophet soon
gained a large following among them. He established peace within their
borders, they recognised him (though not without some exceptions) as their
leader, and together with the companions of his wanderings constituted at
first the bulk and afterwards the flower of his army.</p>

<p>Mohammed conquered the Meccans mainly by paralysing their caravan
trade. When, in the eighth year after his departure from his native town,
he made his triumphal entry into it once more, it needed only one great
encounter with certain Bedouin tribes to bring the whole of Arabia to his
feet and to his faith. If the Bedouins had concluded binding alliances
against him in defence of the religious usages of their forefathers and (what
was still more important to them) their own independence, he would have
laboured in vain; but the inability of the pure Arab to unite for common
action and act under discipline, even for the attainment of great ends, made
it possible for him to bring one tribe after another over to his side by force
or friendly means. He even contrived to turn to practical account the old
connection between his family and the tent-dwelling Choza’a in the neighbourhood
of Mecca. He retained old customs wherever it was possible
so to do, instinctively rather than by deliberate intention. Thus even the
greater part of the heathen worship of Mecca was adapted in externals to
monotheism and incorporated <i>bona fide</i> into Islam. The first important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
successes, especially the battle of Bedr (a great battle according to Arab
notions), in which the men of Mecca lost about seventy dead and seventy
wounded, made a deep and immediate impression: success is the test of proselytisers.
The costly presents which Mohammed gave out of his spoils to such
distinguished men as had not at once become converts at heart also wrought
effectively; in most cases a genuine conversion followed in time. One fact
(among others), by which we can estimate the striking impression the prophet
produced upon the Arabs, is that as each tribe submitted or adopted his religion
it renounced the right of retaliation for the blood shed in the struggle.
Under other circumstances this renunciation of blood-revenge, or of wergild
at least, would have seemed to the Arab the lowest depth of humiliation.
But hard as it might be for the Arabs in general to acknowledge the
prophet as their lord, there was at that time no pagan who would have
fought in earnest for his religion. At the utmost, an old woman here and
there raised a clamour when Mohammed destroyed her idols. Compare this
with the fashion in which other Semites fought for their faith, in which the
Arabs themselves afterwards fought for Islam. Hence, it is evident that,
as has been said, the Arabs of that period had outgrown their religion.</p>

<h4>SUCCESSORS OF MOHAMMED</h4>

<p>But Mohammed was scarcely dead (632) before the existence of his religion
and his empire was again called in question. He had left no instructions
as to how the government was to be carried on after his death. A
ruler was indeed promptly set up to succeed him. Yathreb, now called
Medinat an nabi (the city of the prophet), or merely Medina (the city),
was the capital as before, but the simple-minded proposal of the Medinese
that they should have one sovereign and the people of Mecca another was
rejected with decision by the latter. Abu-Bekr, Mohammed’s most intimate
friend, and the father of his favourite wife, became his successor or vicegerent
(<i>khalifa</i>, caliph). This is another proof of the high esteem the Koreish
enjoyed; for it was a matter of common knowledge that the Arabs would
never submit to a non-Koreishite.</p>

<p>For a while, however, most of them displayed but little inclination to remain
subjects of the new ecclesiastical state. The utmost concession they
would make was to profess their willingness to continue to perform the
<i>salat</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> five times a day, but they would henceforth no longer submit to pay
an annual quota of their cattle or dates in taxes. Nearly all the old friends
of the prophet, even Omar, who now wielded the greatest authority next to
the caliph, despaired of subduing the Arabs again. And here we recognise
once more the faith that moves mountains in fullest and most effective action.
Abu-Bekr was not a man of lofty intellect, but he was firmly convinced
that what Mohammed had preached was pure truth, that his orders must be
obeyed absolutely, and that God would then give his religion the victory.
And the event proved him right. He even insisted on weakening the army
of which he had such sore need by despatching a body of troops for an expedition
to the north which was by no means urgently necessary, merely
because Mohammed had given orders for it, not foreseeing his own death.
But otherwise the difficult task of once more subjugating the Arabs was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
prosecuted with the utmost vigour. Their inability to combine voluntarily
for any great object was more patent than ever. Their scattered forces
could not withstand a foe united under a single command and with a definite
aim in view. The separate tribes were speedily subdued, in most cases
without recourse to the strong arm. The inhabitants of the district of
Yamama offered frantic resistance; they were tillers of the soil and followers
of Maslama (called by the Mohammedans in scorn <i>Musailima</i>, or “little
Maslama”), who had set himself up as an opposition prophet in Mohammed’s
later years. They fought for their settled homes and their faith, and
the battle against Maslama was far more sanguinary than any previous
conflict.</p>

<p>The second conquest of Arabia could scarcely have been achieved had not
the Koreish stood by Abu-Bekr to a man. The leaders, who for years had
striven against the prophet in the stricken field and lost their nearest kin in
the struggle, had begun to realise (some of them before the taking of Mecca
and the majority directly after) that they would gain enormously in power
and consequence by the supremacy of a Koreishite. Mohammed’s marvellous
success had made most of them to a certain extent believers. Several
of those who had been his most zealous opponents afterwards fell or were
severely wounded as champions of his religion. The commander who bore
the brunt of the battle for the subjugation of the rebel Arabs, displaying an
equal measure of sagacity and energy, was a Koreishite, Khalid ben al-Walid,
the same who had been mainly responsible for the victory of the Koreish
over the hosts of Mohammed at Mount Ohod, close by Medina, eight years
before.</p>

<h4>MOSLEM CONQUESTS</h4>

<p>Arabia was hardly reconquered before the great invasion of other
countries began. The prophet himself had set on foot some enterprises
against Syria, but without any particular result. The great thing now to
be accomplished was to transform the Arab hordes from recalcitrant subjects
into joyful warriors of God by the twofold prospect of earthly spoil and
heavenly rewards. Here we recognise the hand of Omar, to whom the
sovereignty passed directly on the death of Abu-Bekr soon after. The wars
of conquest which he inaugurated were crowned with brilliant success. It is
worth while to consider the subject briefly in detail.</p>

<p>Troublesome enemies as the Arab tribes had often proved to the subjects
of the Roman and Persian empires, no one had ever dreamed that they could
constitute a menace to either. It is true that when the Moslem inroads
began, the districts first affected were in a sorry plight. The frequent wars
between the Romans and Persians had sorely enfeebled both empires, and
this was more particularly the case with the last great war, which had lasted
from 607 to 628. Large areas of Roman territory, especially in Palestine,
Syria, and Egypt, had been frightfully ravaged and occupied for years by
the Persians. The valiant and wily emperor Heraclius, however, succeeded
in turning the tide of fortune, and ultimately dictated terms of peace to the
Persians on their own soil. After that the Persian empire had been torn
asunder by quarrels over the succession. Both empires had lost the Arab
outpost they once possessed. The Persians had annihilated the Roman
vassal kingdom of the Ghassanids, and their own subject dynasty in Hira
(which had latterly adopted the Christian faith) had been dethroned by
King Chosroes II. The folly of this was soon apparent. The Bedouins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of the Shaiban tribe utterly routed the royal armies of Persia at Ibu Kar
on the frontiers of Babylonia, probably at the very time when the king’s
forces were pursuing their victorious progress through the distant west.
It was not a great battle, and probably its only direct consequence was that
the unwarlike peasants of neighbouring districts were pillaged by the Bedouins;
but a victory over an army composed in part of regular troops gave
the Arabs confidence. This very Shaiban tribe distinguished itself in the
first Moslem advance into Persian territory.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there is much that remains enigmatical in the immense
success that attended the Moslems. Their armies were not very large.
The emperor Heraclius was an able man, with all the prestige of victory
behind him. When the great struggle of Moslem and Persian began, the
civil wars of the empire were over, and it had a powerful leader&mdash;not
indeed in Yezdegerd, its youthful monarch, but in the mighty prince Rustem,
who had procured the crown for him. The great financial straits to which
both empires were unquestionably reduced must have had its effect upon the
number and efficiency of their troops, but that they were still good for something
is clear from the fact that both the decisive battle on the river Yarmuk
(August, 636) in which the Romans were defeated, and that of Kadisiya
(end of 636 or beginning of 637) in which a like fate waited on the Persian
arms, lasted for several days. The resistance offered must have been very
obstinate. The Roman and Persian armies may have included irregular
troops of various kinds, but they certainly consisted largely of disciplined
soldiers under experienced officers. The Persians brought elephants into
the field, as well as their dreaded mounted cuirassiers. Among the Arabs
there was no purely military order of battle; they fought in the order
of their clans and tribes. This, though it probably insured a strong
feeling of comradeship, was by no means an adequate equivalent for regular
military units. Freiherr von Kremer<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> rightly sees in the salat a substitute,
to some extent, for military drill. In that ceremony the Arabs, hitherto
wholly unaccustomed to discipline, were obliged <i>en masse</i> to repeat the
formulæ with strict exactitude after their leader and to copy every one of his
movements, and any man who was unable to perform the salat with the
congregation was none the less bound to strict compliance with the form of
prayer in which he had been instructed. But the main factor was the
powerful corporate feeling of the Moslem, the ever increasing enthusiasm
for the faith even in those who had at first been indifferent, and the firm
conviction that the warriors for the holy cause, though death in the field
would prevent them from taking a share in the spoils of victory on earth,
would yet partake of the most delightful of terrestrial joys in heaven.
Thus the masterless Arabs, who, for all their turn for boasting, had but little
stomach for heroic deeds, were transformed into the irresistible warriors
of Allah. It was the highest triumph of Semitic religious zeal, a manifestation
on a vast scale that among the Arabs the sense of religion had only
slumbered, to awaken when occasion arose with true Semitic fury. The same
thing has since come to pass again and again on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>For the rest, so far as we can tell, the Arab tribes were not all alike
concerned in these wars of conquest. The great camel-breeding tribes of
the highlands of the interior, in particular, seem to have taken a much
smaller share in them than the tribes of the northern districts of Yemen. It
was a point of the utmost importance that the supreme command was almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
throughout in the hands of men of the Koreish, who at that time proved
themselves a race of born rulers. They led Islam from victory to victory,
proving themselves good Moslems on the whole, but without renouncing
their worldly wisdom. Above all we are constrained to admire the skill,
caution, and boldness with which, from his headquarters at Medina, Omar
directed the campaigns and the rudiments of reorganisation in conquered
countries.</p>

<p>This unpolished and rigidly orthodox man, who lived with the utmost
Arab simplicity while an incalculable revenue was flowing into the treasury
of the empire, proved one of the greatest and wisest of sovereigns. His
injunction that the Arabs should acquire no landed property in the conquered
countries, but should everywhere constitute a military caste in the pay of the
state, was grandly conceived, but proved impracticable in the long run.
Some of the Christian Arabs at first fought against the Moslem, but without
any very great zeal. The majority of them soon exchanged a Christianity
that had never gone very deep for the national religion. The great tribe of
the Taghlib in the Mesopotamian desert was almost the only one in which
Christianity retained its ascendency for any length of time, but it nevertheless
fully participated in the fortunes of the Moslem empire, and even there
the older faith gradually passed away, as it seems to have done among all
Arabs of pure blood.</p>

<p>The victories of the Moslems under Omar were continued under his successor
Othman. Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Assyria, the greater part
of Iran proper, Egypt, and some more of the northern parts of Africa were
already conquered. The inhabitants of the Roman provinces had almost
everywhere submitted to the conquerors without a struggle; in some cases
they had even made overtures to them. The deplorable Christological disputes
contributed largely to this result: the bulk of the Syrians and Copts
were Monophysites and were consequently persecuted in many ways by the
adherents of the Council of Chalcedon, who had gained the ascendency at Constantinople.
Moreover in other respects the Roman government of the period
was not qualified to inspire its Semitic and Egyptian subjects with any great
devotion. The rule of the Arabs, though severe, at first was just, and above
all they scrupulously observed all treaties whatsoever concluded with them.
And the inhabitants of those countries were accustomed to subjection. It
is, however, unlikely that they did the victors much positive service beyond
occasionally acting as spies, and we must not lay too much stress upon the
subjugation of what was on the whole an unwarlike race. Even in Iran,
where Islam was confronted by far stronger opposition on national and
religious grounds, the bulk of the population, especially in rural districts,
offered at most a desultory resistance, while the victors had still many a
battle to fight with the forces of the king and the nobles.</p>

<h4>CIVIL WARS AMONG THE MOSLEMS</h4>

<p>This career of conquest was interrupted by the great civil wars. The
Arabs knew of nothing between entire liberty and absolute monarchy.
The latter was the form which the caliphate first took, but it was universally
assumed that the ruler was bound to abide strictly by the laws of religion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
When Othman, grown old and feeble, was led by excessive nepotism and
other causes into a breach of the latter, the result was a rebellion, in which he
ultimately perished (656). The murder was followed by years of civil broils,
and some decades later the whole thing was enacted afresh. The war was
waged under religious pretexts, and to some extent from religious motives;
but it was in the main a struggle for sovereignty between various members
of the Koreish. Tribal animosities old and new were brought into play,
and induced the tribes to throw in their lot with one or other of the leading
parties. The outcome of the two great civil wars was that in each case the
ablest man placed himself at the head of the empire; the first to do so, after
the murder of Ali, Mohammed’s son-in-law, being the Omayyad Moawiya,
son of Abu Sufyan, the leader of the heathen of Mecca against Mohammed.
In his reign Damascus, where he had lived as governor for many years
before, became the capital in place of Medina. The victor in the second
instance was Abd al-Melik, of another branch of the Omayyad family. They
were both men of great capacity but essentially worldly-minded. One of the
prophet’s grandsons, a son of Ali, had made his peace, while another, Husain
by name, fell in a foolish attempt at rebellion (680); though he was
thenceforth regarded as a martyr, and much blood was shed to avenge his
death on the rulers <i>de facto</i>. The pious stood aloof, sorrowful or indignant,
but the sovereignty remained in the hands of the Omayyads. To Europe
these civil wars were nothing short of salvation. Had they not checked
the career of Arab conquest, Islam might even then have subjugated Asia
Minor, the Balkan peninsula, and the whole of Spain, and spread beyond
it to Gaul and remoter lands.</p>

<p>The Arabs of that period knew how to conquer and to hold fast what
they had won; for organisation they had less aptitude. Wherever they
could they left administration, and taxation more especially, as they found
it. At first the register of taxes was kept in Greek in the former dominions of
Rome, and in Persian in those of Persia; and not until after more than half a
century did the Arabic language become predominant in official book-keeping.
The Omayyads had gained the mastery by the loyalty of the Arabs of Syria;
they were tied to Syria, and the great tracts of territory to the east were
hard to rule from thence. Moreover the Moslems of Babylonia, in many
respects a more important province, were on the whole hostile to them.
And, what was worse, the old lack of discipline among the Arabs had manifested
itself strongly in a new form. Instead of small clans being at feud
with one another, as had usually been the case in former days, they had
ranged themselves in large and mutually hostile groups. One of these was
composed of the Arabs of Yemen (real or reputed), two others of the tribes
which claimed descent from Ishmael, the Mudhar and Rabia. If a caliph or
a caliph’s vicegerent sided with the Yemen he had the Mudhar against
him; if he favoured the Rabia the Mudhar were likewise hostile, etc. In
the remoter provinces the hostile Arabs sometimes waged regular wars with
one another on their own account. To add to this, there were risings of
fanatics of various kinds. None but the ablest of the Omayyads (and on
the whole they were an able dynasty) could maintain even tolerable order
in the vast empire which extended its borders farther and farther when
once the civil wars were over. The brief reign of a weakling or a libertine
was enough to spoil everything. The purely Arab empire lacked the elements
of stability.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, great masses of the conquered peoples had gone
over to Islam. Temporal advantages on the one hand, and on the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the suitability of this coarse-grained religion to the Semites, and probably to
the less educated Egyptians too, led steadily to the abandonment of a Christianity
which in these parts was but little superior to Islam. But in Iran
also the new religion soon made great advances on its own merits, though
in some places (it must be admitted) very much at the expense of the purity
of its pristine character. The national pride of the Arabs could not endure
the practical application of the theoretical precept of Islam that all believers
should be on an absolutely equal footing. The new converts remained Moslems
of the second class, and, in certain districts at least, they felt the distinction
bitterly. Even at the time of the second great civil war these
so-called “clients” (<i>mawali</i>) had on one occasion played a prominent part,
though only as the tools of an ambitious Arab.</p>

<p>The action of a “client” population of this sort was fraught with far
greater consequences when another Koreishite family&mdash;the Abbasids, descendants
of an uncle of Mohammed&mdash;rose up against the Omayyads. One
of their great emissaries placed himself at the head of the Moslem natives of
eastern Persia (Khorasan) and by the help of these Iranians the Abbasids
secured the throne (750). The change must be regarded as in great measure
a strong reaction of the Persian element against the Arab. The long
succession of great oriental empires had been interrupted by an empire
purely Arab, and the sequence was now renewed. The seat of government
was once more transferred to Babylonia; Baghdad took the place of Babylon
and Ctesiphon. The great offices of state were already largely filled by persons
of other than Arab descent. The old Arab pride of birth was outraged by
the fact that no weight was now attached to the consideration of whether the
mother of the ruler had been a free woman or a slave, and that thus the Arab
strain of the reigning dynasty became more and more interfused with foreign
blood as time went on. A second Persian reaction is signalised by the
victory won, after a protracted struggle, by the caliph Mamun, the son of
a Persian woman, over his brother Amin, whose mother was of the stock
of the Abbasids (813). Mamun’s troops were nearly all of them Persians.
Their leader, the Persian Tahir, founded the first semi-independent sovereignty
on Iranian soil. The forms of government remained Arab to a great
extent, and Arabic likewise remained the official language, but genuine Arabdom
receded more and more into the background. Above all, professional
troops recruited from the peoples of the East, or even of the far West, had
almost wholly superseded the Arab levies.</p>

<p>The process of Arabisation went on apace, in the north Semitic countries,
Egypt, and even in great tracts of the “Occident” (Maghreb),<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but this Arab-speaking
population, with its profession of Islam and its preponderance of non-Arabic
elements, differed widely in thought and feeling from the Arabs of
pure blood, who from that time forward were represented (much as they were
before the days of Islam) almost entirely by the Bedouins and dwellers in the
oases of Arabia and a few places in Africa. The great historic rôle of the pure
Arab was played out. But this neo-Arabic nationality gave more or less of
the same character to all Islamite countries. This holds good in great measure
of Iran and the countries that bordered on it to the northeast, south
and southeast, in so far as they fell under the influence of the Arab religion.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Nevertheless the eastern provinces of the caliphate no more adopted the
Arab tongue (which gained the mastery in the principal countries of
the western half and even in a great part of the Maghreb) than the eastern
half of the Roman Empire had adopted the Latin tongue at the time that
the west was almost completely Romanised. The Arab tongue exercised
a profound influence none the less upon the Persians and all such nations as
drew their culture from Persia. It was not for nothing that even in the
last-named country Arabic was long the language of government, religion,
erudition, and poetry, and so remained to some extent even after the native
language had reasserted itself. Persian (and Hindustani, Kurdish, etc.,
likewise) had borrowed largely from Arabic, especially in the department of
abstract terms&mdash;a thing we should not have expected in view of the antiquity
of Persian civilisation and the newness of that of Arabia. The influence of
Arabic is apparent even in the remotest branches of modern Persian literature,
just as all Teutonic languages bear traces of the profound influence of
Latin, which formerly occupied a position in Europe analogous in many
respects to that of Arabic in Islamite countries.</p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF PERSIA ON THE MOSLEMS</h4>

<p>But if the Arab spirit modified the spirit of Persia in many ways, the
converse action was no less strong, possibly stronger. Many political institutions,
the forms of polite society, nay, of town life as a whole, luxury, art,
and even the fashion of dress, came to the Arabs from Persia. In the
Omayyad period Arabic poetry remains in essentials true to the methods of
the old heathen Bedouin poets; though side by side with them&mdash;and more
particularly in the works of the best poets&mdash;we mark the gradual growth of
a more elegant style, suited to the more cultivated tastes of the towns, and
even of a courtly school of poetry. Even in later times, however, the methods
of the elder poets found many imitators. But after the Abbasid period
the writers of Arabic poems, taken as a whole, were no longer men of pure
Arab descent; many were freedmen or of humble origin and Persian or
Aramaic nationality. Thus during the Moslem period even the native poets
of Persia began by writing in Arabic, and hence the rising school of Persian
poetry adhered closely to the traditions of the Arabic school, both in metre
and all points of structure, and in subject-matter and verbal expression.
Unhappily it showed itself equally ready to imitate the artificiality into
which Arabic poetry had sunk at that period. It is true, indeed, that from
the outset Persian poetry displayed certain distinctive features, and that its
noblest achievement, the national epic, is, broadly speaking, original, though
even there Arabic influence is potent in the details.</p>

<p>The lustre of Arab culture, especially as displayed in the large cities of
Babylonia, the central province, arose from a liberal intermixture of Persian
and Arab elements. In some of these cities Persian was actually spoken by
the bulk of the population, at least in the early centuries of Islamism. The
influence of Byzantine civilisation on that of Arabia, though far slighter,
should not be overlooked. For centuries the upper classes of Babylonia,
luxurious and often frivolous as they were, maintained a high level of intellectual
activity. The gift of expressing oneself in elegant Arabic with Persian
charm and Persian wit was held in the highest esteem. Similar centres
of superior culture existed in other Arabic-speaking countries right across
to Spain, and for a time even in Sicily. Through all the wide domains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Islam men travelled much, partly to complete their education and acquire
the polish of the man of the world, partly for pure love of travel and thirst
of adventure. Public and private societies of <i>beaux-esprits</i> and scholars
existed in every town of any importance. A brisk trade by land and sea
did much to insure the rapid interchange of commodities between regions
the most remote, even such as lay far beyond the pale of Islamism, and the
result of trade was the accumulation of vast wealth in the great cities.
Thither also flowed the taxes levied <i>per fas et nefas</i>, upon the inhabitants
of the plains. Of course there was no lack of misery in the great cities of
the Arab world, any more than in those of Europe and America at the
present day.</p>

<h4>ARAB RECORDS AND TRADITIONS</h4>

<p>The Moslems very early began to hand down biographical records of the
prophet, at first by oral, but in the main authentic tradition. More important
still to the whole Moslem world was the transmission and collection of
precepts covering the whole of life, which pretended to be preserved in the
exact form in which they had been uttered by the prophet or made current
by his act.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It is of the utmost advantage to us to-day that the history of
Mohammed’s successors, of their great conquests, and of the empire, follows
so immediately upon his own. The several records used to be handed
on with the names of those who vouched for them, from the first eye-witness
down to the last teller of the tale, variations of statement being placed close
side by side. In this way narratives told from the point of view of absolutely
different parties have come down to us side by side, many of them
dealing with the most important events of the first centuries of Islam, so
that historical criticism is frequently in a position to ascertain the main
features of what really took place with far greater certainty than if the
Arabs themselves had proceeded to draw up a regular history and had manipulated
their authorities in their own fashion. The tradition of the deeds
and adventures of the ancient heroes of Arabia, too, was carefully cherished,
and much of it has come down to us.</p>

<h4>ARAB LEARNING</h4>

<p>In this, as in all branches of exact learning of the Moslems, the Arabic
language stands alone at first and even in later times occupies the foremost
place, whether the student immediately concerned was of pure Arab descent
(which was probably very seldom the case) or of mixed or foreign blood.
This holds good of the sciences related to theology, above all, and of all
branches of knowledge taught in the schools. Not one of the sciences properly
so called was evolved by the Arabs (and the word may be taken in the
most comprehensive sense) out of their own inner consciousness, not even
grammar, the first branch of learning to assume the form of an exact science;
some of the fundamental conceptions involved in it originated in the logic
of Aristotle. This science, arising, as it did, out of the necessity of expounding
the <i>Koran</i> and ancient poetry and the desire to preserve the classic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
tongue of the Bedouins, which was liable to rapid alteration in the lands
they had conquered, developed then, it is true, on very independent lines.
Above all, Arab philosophy is wholly dependent upon Greek works, most
of them translated from the original by Syrians or known through Syrian
versions.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Even Islamite dogmatism found itself constrained to adopt the
methods of the pagan philosophy of Greece.</p>

<p>The men who laid the foundations of Arab learning were for the most
part not of Arab descent, though exceptions are more numerous than is
commonly supposed. Sibawaih, who drew up the first great compendium
of the Arabic language, was a Persian; though practically all he did was to
compile what he had heard from his teachers, the chief of whom, Khalil, was
in all likelihood a pure-blooded Arab. And this work, upon which that of
later schools made little advance as far as the substance is concerned, is very
clumsy in form, and as unsystematic as though he had been of pure Arab
descent. Exact systematisation is a hard thing for the true Semite to compass.
The ascendency exercised by the Arabic language during the centuries
in which the intellectual life of Islamite countries was in its glory is
best seen from the fact that even those Persians who claimed precedence
for their own nation set forth their opinions to that effect in Arabic works.</p>

<p>In this place it is of course impossible to enter upon the history of Arab
learning; we can only insist upon one single point, namely that (at least
in the branches of scholarship which were held in the highest esteem)
the culmination was reached early, and they were then treated of in countless
works&mdash;compendiums, abstracts, commentaries, and versifications&mdash;without
any particular variation in the subject-matter. How far medicine,
natural science, and mathematics were advanced beyond the stage which the
Greeks (and it may be, the Hindus) had attained by works written in
Arabic I am not in a position to say.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The average standard of the very
numerous chronicles in Arabic is considerably higher than that of the Latin
chronicles of the Middle Ages, because, for one thing, the writers of the
former were men in the thick of actual life, some of them indeed men of
considerable consequence, while the latter were generally written in monasteries.
We even come upon the rudiments of historical criticism, or at least
of a comprehensive historical survey. The number of Arabic works containing
the biography of eminent men, scholars, poets, and so forth, is positively
amazing, as is the wealth of anthologies of every kind, in which poetry alternates
with prose. In their works on literary history, again, they are in the
habit of giving many specimens of the poems of the particular writers discussed.
Among these anthologies and works on the history of literature
are some of remarkable merit and of the highest value to us.</p>

<p>Furthermore we are much beholden to Arab authors of works on geography.
These are almost all based upon actual observation and written with
a practical aim; and thus have a great advantage over mere scholastic works.
Wherever geography assumes a strictly scientific form, however, it is indebted
to the system of Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Moslem philosophy (of which the most notable exponents were men of
non-Arab descent, Persians, Spaniards, etc., though they all wrote in Arabic
as a matter of course) is entirely an emanation from that of Greece, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
it rises here and there to the exposition of grand original ideas. The same
holds good even of mysticism, which is at bottom in sharp opposition to
scientific speculation. Originally an alien growth among the Arabs, with
its roots partly in neo-Platonism and Christianity, partly in Hindu and
Persian soil, it nevertheless attained a notable development among the Moslems.
All speculation was kept within strict limits by the dominant religion.
More liberal spirits (of which there were never many) were forced to observe
the utmost caution in their utterances; although there was probably
more freedom of thought in Islam than in Christian Europe.</p>

<p>But whatever judgment we may pass upon Arabic scientific literature as
a whole, however readily we may concede that in proportion to its vast bulk
the part played by originality is small, while that played by the repetition of
repetitions is very large indeed, it is nevertheless, on the whole, greatly
superior to the contemporary literature of Europe. There we should seek
in vain for such works as, <i>e.g.</i>, the great <i>Book of Songs</i>, which sets before us
in varied guise the course of Arabic poetry down to late Moslem days, and
the lives and doings of the Arabs of old time and of the later courts (tenth
century) alike; or the geographical work of Mukaddasi (tenth century),
the works of Biruni (a Persian from the neighbourhood of what is now
Khiva, tenth and eleventh centuries) on chronology and other subjects, which
are equally remarkable for their keen observation and strictly scientific temper;
the geographical dictionary of Yakut (a man of Byzantine lineage of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries); the politico-historical <i>Introduction to the
Chronicle of Ibn Khaldun</i> (of Tunis, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries) and
many others. Not until close upon the dawn of the Renaissance does Europe
gradually assert her decisive superiority over the East in every sphere of
intellectual life. Arabic literature is of peculiar and supreme importance to
ourselves because its vast store presents to us a comprehensive and vivid
picture of life and thought in wide regions of the nearer East. Without it
we should find the oriental peoples of antiquity far harder to understand.
From this point of view the study of Arabic is of even greater importance as
an aid to the right comprehension of the Old Testament and the cuneiform
inscriptions than it is, on purely linguistic grounds, for the interpretation of
the Hebrew and Assyrian languages.</p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF THE ARABS UPON EUROPE</h4>

<p>The principal effect of Arab learning upon that of Europe consists in
this&mdash;that a few Greek works which had been translated into Arabic and a
few Arabic works which had followed in the footsteps of the Greek, were
translated into Latin either from the original or through the medium of
Hebrew versions, and thus became text-books to the Europeans. The original
ideas of Arabic writers on medicine and mathematics may also have been
imparted to western nations by translations of their writings. In all likelihood
a European now and again studied medicine under the direct guidance
of an oriental physician. Translations of certain Arabic books of tales and
fables, native to India in the first instance, were widely circulated in Europe.
Arabic poetry scarcely influenced that of Europe at all, at the utmost a few
Romance verse-forms may be imitated from those of later Arabic poetry.
Generally speaking we cannot but say that, in the region of intellectual
activity, the influence of the Moslem on the Christian world was far slighter
than we should have expected, considering the innumerable points of contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
between the two in Spain, Sicily, the scene of the Crusades, and elsewhere.
On the other hand, the Europeans borrowed many details of outward culture
and luxury from the Orientals.</p>

<h4>LATER EVENTS OF ARABIC CIVILIZATION</h4>

<p>During the early period of the Abbasid dynasty the Arab empire continued
to expand more and more. It is true that the perpetual wars with
Byzantium did not result in any permanent conquests in Asia Minor; but
Islam, and with it a certain process of Arabisation, advanced with giant
strides, especially in the East. This advance continued even while the
caliphate fell lower and lower and its power passed to other despots, most of
them not even of Arab descent, who usually treated the caliph with a show
of reverence as their lord, but practically took little heed of him. Moreover,
the Abbasids never ruled over Spain, whither an Omayyad had fled to
found there an empire of his own, which soon attained a high degree of
prosperity. Other empires, either absolutely independent of the caliphate,
or actually hostile to it, presently arose in their places. But the glory of
Arab civilisation suffered no great eclipse, even when the caliphs were mere
puppets in the hands of the Buids, who had come as mercenaries from the
semi-barbaric mountain tract of Gilan in Iran and had established a mighty
empire (tenth century). Even the terrible Turkish migration, which led
to the rise of the far mightier empire of the Seljuks, left much unharmed.
The brisk and joyous life of a refined civilisation still shines forth from the
pages of Hariri’s <i>Makamat</i> (eleventh century). The Crusades did indeed
bring greater misery than ever upon the wretched land of Palestine, but on
the whole they affected the nations of Islam far less than those which
adhered to the church of Rome. The attacks of the Mongols were the first
shock which destroyed the fairest flower of Islamite civilisation. Traces of
the ravages perpetrated by these monsters are visible to this day. The
destruction of Baghdad (1258) inflicted a terrible blow upon Arab culture.
At that time the caliphate was in reality a petty state having for its capital
a metropolis with which Constantinople alone could vie in importance.</p>

<p>The end of the caliphate coincided with and marked the close of the glorious
period of the Arab empire. Even before it came to pass, the Mongols
had annihilated the flourishing civilisation of the East by destroying the
great cities there, and massacring their inhabitants. A remnant of Arab culture
found refuge in Egypt, whither happily the Mongols did not penetrate.</p>

<p>Yet even this conquest actually promoted the spread of Islam. The
Mongols settled among the Moslems and soon went over to Islam themselves.
The greater part of Asia Minor had already been won over by the Seljuks to
Turkish nationality and the faith of Islam, and from thence arose the empire of
the Ottoman Turks, for centuries the terror of Europe. At the very time when
Islamism, after a protracted struggle, was thrust forth from Spain, the fierce
and fanatical worshippers of the God of Arabia bore the banner of his prophet
far on the way towards Europe. And while warriors fought for the glory
of Allah, Arabic learning was zealously pursued in the theological schools of
the Ottoman empire, as it had been in the Middle Ages, and there was much
instruction and literary labour after the older Arabic and Persian model, and
now and again a work of real scientific value came into being. This mediæval
pursuit of learning still prevails wherever Islam holds sway, and its
sphere, though circumscribed in Europe, is of vast extent in Asia and Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and still continues to expand. It is true that in many Islamite countries the
influence of modern Europe makes itself felt even in learning, but it does
not go deep, and the genuine Moslem scholar still treads closely in the footprints
of the true believers, his predecessors. And Mecca, the home of the
prophet, with his sanctuary and his school of theology, is to this day the
religious centre for all who admit his claims, and recite the Arabic formulæ
of the salat, and listen&mdash;though in most cases without the faintest comprehension&mdash;to
the Arabic <i>Book of God</i>. Thither the pious pilgrim makes
his way once in his life at least, if he possibly can, nor does he neglect to
visit at the same time Mohammed’s grave at Medina. This constant gathering
of pilgrims from every quarter at Mecca, and the influence exercised upon
their native countries by the theologians who settled there, either temporarily
or permanently, are of the utmost importance to the unity and strength of
Islam, or, at least, of the creed it involves, which is that held by far the
greater number of Semitic races. The language of the Holy City is Arabic,
but the population is a mixture of the most diverse elements of nationality.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<h4>LATER ISLAMITE MOVEMENTS</h4>

<p>The Arabs of Arabia (as has been said before) have long since lost the
place in the history of the world which they once occupied under circumstances
wholly exceptional. Only twice since then has a strong movement
made itself felt in at least the nearest of Islamite lands. In the tenth century
the Karmates, a secret sect of Persian origin, hostile to the Abbasid
caliphs and, at bottom, to Islam altogether, established themselves firmly
in a part of northeastern Arabia, very difficult of access. Their leaders succeeded
in winning over many Bedouins by the prospect of booty, and thus
caravans of pilgrims were frequently massacred or robbed of all they possessed;
some of the large cities of Babylonia were several times captured and
pillaged; Mecca itself was taken during the pilgrim festival; the sacrosanct
Black Stone carried off (930), and an end put to pilgrimages for a time.
These proceedings were accomplished by much bloodshed. The Black Stone
was ultimately restored after an interval of twenty-one years, on payment
of a heavy ransom. The Karmates were secretly in league with the Fatimites,
the anti-caliph dynasty in Africa, which claimed descent from Ali
and Fatima, the daughter of Mohammed. They sank back into insignificance
by slow degrees.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> A connection of some sort exists between the
above-mentioned occurrences and the migration of certain Bedouin tribes,
under the auspices of the Fatimites, from Arabia to Upper Egypt and
remoter parts of northern Africa, where they committed great ravages
(eleventh century).</p>

<p>And in the eighteenth century the puritanic movement of Abd al-Wahhab
arose in the heart of Arabia, with the object of restoring Islam to its pristine
purity and repudiating all innovations that had crept in by lapse of
time, from the veneration of the tombs of saints to the smoking of tobacco.
The Wahhabees brought the greater part of Arabia, inclusive of the holy
cities, under their influence for a while, exacted a minute observation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
precepts of religion, bore strict rule in all things, and established a condition
of peace such as that country, predestinate to lawlessness, had not known
since the days of the caliphate. The Wahhabees were heretics inasmuch as
they did not regard the “catholic” principle, which had won acceptance in
Islam, that all things adopted by the consensus of the whole church were
binding upon all men; though of course the fiction was kept up that this
consensus was invariably in harmony with the original character of the
faith. They, on the contrary, held in all seriousness the principle, which
was universally recognised in theory, that every innovation in the sphere of
religion was wholly reprehensible.</p>

<p>The great simplicity of the religion of Mohammed made it possible to
effect the restoration of its pristine purity in a far higher degree than the
mighty efforts of the sixteenth and subsequent centuries could effect a
return to primitive Christianity; and besides, the conditions of contemporary
life in Arabia were not widely different from those that had prevailed
in the time of the prophet. A few of the theologians of the Ottoman
empire actually recognised the Wahhabees as orthodox. These fanatical
zealots were, however, obnoxious to the Turkish government for more
reasons than one, and hence their power was broken by Muhammed Ali of
Egypt, after a desperate struggle. Wahhabism actually exists to this day
in the interior of Arabia, but under two mutually hostile dynasties and (in
spite of having occasionally sent its emissaries as far as India) without any
great prospect of spreading. It is firmly rooted only among the non-nomadic
Arabs. The Bedouins never obey a Wahhabee ruler except under compulsion.
They are at all times loath to serve a master, and though animated
by the Moslem spirit, they are very negligent in the performance of their
religious duties. They do not even hesitate to extort all they possibly can
from pilgrim caravans, either by openly waylaying them or by levying toll
for the privilege of passing through their territory. Taken as a whole, the
life of the Bedouin of to-day still bears a strong resemblance to that of his
ancestors long ago, but his intellectual level seems to have sunk from the
height it maintained at the time of Mohammed. Even the number of
places in Arabia suitable for agriculture appears to have diminished through
the neglect and decay of irrigation.</p>

<p>The fact that a few points on the coast are of some importance to
European commerce and politics is of no consequence to the country as a
whole, at least for the present.</p>

<h3 id="HISTORY_IN_OUTLINE_OF_PARTHIANS_SASSANIDS_AND_ARABS">HISTORY IN OUTLINE OF PARTHIANS, SASSANIDS, AND ARABS</h3>

<p>We turn back now to the scene of the earlier history, turning back in time
also. The events of three great empires will pass quickly before the view,
the period of time involved being more than seventeen hundred years. The
territories occupied by the peoples under consideration were wide, and the
peoples themselves successively dominated the eastern world, and contested
supremacy there with Rome. Of the Parthians and Sassanids it must be said
that, while important in holding Rome back, they had otherwise an inconsiderable
influence in the West; moreover, Rome could not have retained the
Orient even had she conquered it. As regards the culture influence of the
Parthians and Sassanids in Europe, this was virtually <i>nil</i>. The case is quite
different when we come to the Arabs. Here was a race which not only
became dominant in the East, but seriously threatened to overthrow and
supplant the entire civilisation of Europe; and which, foiled in this, retained
supremacy in the East and developed an indigenous culture that powerfully
influenced all Christendom.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the relations between the Parthians, Sassanids,
and Arabs is geographical and chronological rather than ethnological. The
Parthians were overthrown by the Sassanids, and the Sassanids by the Arabs.
The three peoples successively ruled over similar territories, and their
histories may advantageously be considered in sequence; but it will be
understood that they represented different races and bore to one another
merely the relation of the conquered to the conqueror. An outline of the
history of Armenia is appended, to give completeness to the subject, much
as we gave chronologies of various other minor nations of Western Asia in a
previous volume.</p>

<div class="chronology">

<h4>THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE (250 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-228 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h4>

<p><span class="smcapuc year">B.C.</span> During the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus II, Diodotus, viceroy of Bactria, seizes
the northeastern provinces and assumes the title of king. The formation of this
kingdom is not agreeable to the chiefs of the desert tribes who, under the Seleucid
rule, have never felt direct control, and some of them migrate into Parthia. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
them are two brothers, Arsaces and Tiridates, of the Parnians. In a quarrel which
arises between them and Pherecles, presumably satrap of Astauene, the latter is slain
and Arsaces is proclaimed king in Asaak, northwest of Parthia.</p>

<p><span class="year">250</span> Foundation of an independent monarchy by <b>Arsaces I</b>. Antiochus, on account of
civil and foreign wars, is unable to proceed against Arsaces.</p>

<p><span class="year">248</span> Death of Arsaces. His brother, <b>Tiridates</b>, succeeds, taking the name of Arsaces, which
is also borne by all his successors as a throne name. They take the title of “king of
kings.”</p>

<p><span class="year">242</span> After defeat of Seleucus Callinicus at Ancyra, Tiridates invades Parthia, slays the
eparch Andragores, and takes possession of the province. He next seizes Hyrcania,
and causes a large army to oppose Seleucus.</p>

<p><span class="year">238</span> Decisive victory of Tiridates over Seleucus. The latter is obliged to return to Antioch
on account of civil war, and Tiridates is enabled to consolidate his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="year">211</span> Death of Tiridates. His son, <b>Arsaces II</b>, sometimes, but incorrectly, called <b>Artabanus</b>,
succeeds.</p>

<p><span class="year">209</span> Antiochus the Great wins a victory over Arsaces on the summit of Mount Labus. The
Parthians retire to Sirynca and are besieged by Antiochus. Surrender of Sirynca,
and treaty of peace. Arsaces retains Parthia, but is reduced to a vassal of Antiochus.
Parthia remains undisturbed for some years.</p>

<p><span class="year">191</span> <b>Phriapatius</b> or <b>Arsaces (III) Philadelphus</b> succeeds his father. Owing to the decay
of Seleucid power, he acts as protector of the Greeks in his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="year">176</span> <b>Phraates I</b> or <b>Arsaces (IV) Theopator</b> succeeds his father. He conquers the Mardians.</p>

<p><span class="year">171</span> Phraates dies, leaving the throne to his brother, <b>Mithridates I</b> or <b>Arsaces (V)
Epiphanes</b>, who at once annexes several satrapies of Bactria to his kingdom. He
holds court in Hyrcania.</p>

<p><span class="year">155</span> At death of King Eucratides of Bactria, Mithridates continues the conquest of that
country. The Hindu Kush becomes the eastern boundary of Parthia. Mithridates
turns to the west.</p>

<p><span class="year">147</span> The province of Babylonia is wrested from the Seleucids. The East is finally lost to
the Macedonians.</p>

<p><span class="year">139</span> Capture of Demetrius II of Syria, who has attempted to establish himself in Mesopotamia.</p>

<p><span class="year">138</span> Successful campaign in Elymais. Death of Mithridates. He has made Parthia a great
power. His son, <b>Phraates II</b> or <b>Arsaces (VI) Euergetes</b>, succeeds. He adds
Margiana to the kingdom. The seat of the kingdom is transferred to Media.</p>

<p><span class="year">130</span> Antiochus Sidetes begins a vigorous campaign against the Parthians, whom he defeats
in a great battle on the Upper Zab. Babylon and Ecbatana are recovered.</p>

<p><span class="year">129</span> The Parthians make secret terms with the Medes and attack Antiochus, whose host is
annihilated and he himself slain. Phraates compelled to attack the Scythians, whom
he had invited to assist him against Antiochus. They have arrived too late, and, as
Phraates refuses to pay them, they begin to ravage the country.</p>

<p><span class="year">128</span> Death of Phraates in a disastrous battle with the Scythians. His uncle, <b>Artabanus I</b>
or <b>Arsaces (VII) Nicator</b>, son of Phriapatius, succeeds. The Scythians withdraw,
content with their victory; Artabanus pays them tribute. There appear to have
been rival kings in this and the following reign. Perhaps they are Scythians. The
usurpers are suppressed. Artabanus dies (date unknown), after a short reign, in
battle with the Tochari, and is succeeded by his son, <b>Mithridates (II) the Great</b> or
<b>Arsaces (VIII) Theos Euergetes</b>. He wages many wars, and wins victories from
the Scythians. Lost territory is recovered. The Euphrates is fixed as the western
boundary of the kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="year">94</span> Mithridates puts Tigranes II on the disputed throne of Greater Armenia.</p>

<p><span class="year">92</span> Sulla, proprætor of Cilicia, meets the ambassador of Mithridates on the Euphrates,
seeking the Roman alliance in some connection with the Parthian schemes against
Syria. First contact of Parthia with Rome. Mithridates at war with Laodice, queen
of Commagene.</p>

<p><span class="year">88</span> About this date Mithridates captures Demetrius III and his army, dies shortly afterwards,
and is succeeded by <b>Artabanus II</b> or <b>Arsaces IX</b>. He is the last to bear
title “king of kings,” which passes to Tigranes II of Armenia.</p>

<p><span class="year">77</span> <b>Sinatruces</b> or <b>Arsaces (X) Autocrator</b>, an exile living with the Scythian tribe of
the Sacarances, is placed on the throne at the age of eighty. Continual wars with
Tigranes, who conquers Media, ravages Arbela and Nineveh, and compels the cession
of Adiabene and Nisibis.</p>

<p><span class="year">73</span> Mithridates of Pontus appeals in vain to both Sinatruces and Tigranes for help against
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="year">70</span> <b>Phraates III</b> succeeds his father.</p>

<p><span class="year">69</span> Phraates declines to help Mithridates of Pontus, whom Tigranes has joined. Tigranes
offers to restore his Median conquests to Phraates if he will assist. Phraates hesitates,
but</p>

<p><span class="year">66</span> accepts overtures of Pompey, and, with the younger Tigranes, who has quarrelled with
his father, prepares to invade Armenia. Phraates besieges Artaxarta, but leaves the
younger Tigranes to continue. Defeat of Tigranes by his father. The former flees
to Pompey. The elder Tigranes surrenders to Pompey, and the younger is put in
chains. Phraates demands Tigranes’ deliverance, but it is refused. Phraates recovers
Media and resumes title “king of kings.”</p>

<p><span class="year">64</span> While Pompey is in Syria, Phraates attacks and defeats the elder Tigranes. Pompey
refuses to interfere, but sends umpires to settle the dispute.</p>

<p><span class="year">57</span> Murder of Phraates by his two sons, who divide the kingdom. <b>Orodes</b> or <b>Hyrodes I</b>
takes Parthia, and <b>Mithridates III</b> takes Media. The latter is soon expelled for his
cruelty, and Orodes reigns alone. Mithridates expects the Romans to restore him,
but they are compelled to go to Egypt to restore Ptolemy XI.</p>

<p><span class="year">55</span> He attacks Orodes alone, who flees, but with the help of Surenas,</p>

<p><span class="year">54</span> captures Mithridates in Babylon and puts him to death. Crassus takes advantage of
this civil strife to invade Parthia.</p>

<p><span class="year">53</span> Great defeat of the Romans at Carrhæ by Surenas. Orodes makes peace with Armenia.
He puts Surenas to death through jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="year">52</span> Unsuccessful Parthian invasion of Syria.</p>

<p><span class="year">51</span> Cassius defeats the Parthians at Antigonia.</p>

<p><span class="year">50</span> The satrap of Mesopotamia raises a revolt in favour of Pacorus, son of Orodes. Pacorus
is recalled by Orodes and Syria is evacuated. Orodes associates Pacorus with
him on the throne.</p>

<p>After the battle of Philippi, Labienus, who has been sent from Rome to obtain help
from Orodes, advises him to seize Syria.</p>

<p><span class="year">40</span> Pacorus, Labienus, and a large army attack Syria, which falls into Parthian hands.
All the Phœnician cities except Tyre submit. The Parthians appear in Palestine and
the country rises against Herod and Phasael. Hyrcanus deposed and Antigonus substituted.
The cities of Asia Minor except Stratonicea open their gates to Labienus.</p>

<p><span class="year">39</span> Ventidius, Antony’s general, drives Labienus from Asia Minor. Capture and execution
of Labienus.</p>

<p><span class="year">38</span> Complete rout of the Parthians and death of Pacorus at battle of Cyrrhestica. The
Parthians evacuate Syria.</p>

<p><span class="year">37</span> Orodes, in grief at Pacorus’ loss, resigns crown to his son <b>Phraates IV</b>. He at once
murders his brothers and then his father, his own son, and all possible claimants
of the throne. He removes the capital to Ctesiphon. Many of the nobles flee to
Antony, who plans a war against Parthia.</p>

<p><span class="year">36</span> Antony appears in Atropatene and besieges the capital. The expedition proves a
failure.</p>

<p><span class="year">33</span> Rebellion against Phraates, culminating</p>

<p><span class="year">32</span> in an unknown usurper taking the throne. He is succeeded in a few months by <b>Tiridates
II</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">30</span> After battle of Actium, which draws the Roman troops from Media, and Parthia, the
Parthians seize Media and Armenia and put Artaxes II on the Armenian throne.
Phraates regains his kingdom for a short time. Tiridates flees to Syria, where he is
protected by Octavian.</p>

<p><span class="year">27</span> Tiridates, with the help of the Arabs, surprises Phraates and compels him to flee.
Phraates finally persuades the Scythians to help him and</p>

<p><span class="year">26</span> Phraates is reinstated. Tiridates flees to Augustus, carrying Phraates’ younger son
with him.</p>

<p><span class="year">23</span> Augustus restores Phraates’ son to him. Civil war rages in Parthia.</p>

<p><span class="year">20</span> Augustus visits the East. Phraates, in fear, returns Roman captives and the ensigns
taken from Crassus and Antony, to Augustus.</p>

<p><span class="year">10</span> Phraates sends his family to Rome in order to remove causes of civil strife, keeping
only his favourite wife Urania, an Italian slave girl presented by Augustus, and her
child Phraates or Phraataces.</p>

<p><span class="year">2</span> About this date Urania and <b>Phraates V</b> (or <b>Phraataces</b>) murder Phraates IV.
Phraataces expels Artavasdes III from Armenia and puts Tigranes IV on the throne.
He also deposes Ariobarzanes II of Atropatene (Media), who was established on that
throne by Augustus about 10 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> A line of Parthian princes succeed in Atropatene.</p>

<p><span class="smcapuc year">A.D.</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="year">1</span> Augustus makes terms with Phraates, who resigns all claims on Armenia and sends
his sons to Rome as hostages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="year">2</span> Phraataces marries his mother, in consequence of which</p>

<p><span class="year">4</span> he is deposed and takes refuge in Rome. The Parthians bring back an exiled prince,
<b>Orodes II</b>, and make him king. He proves a cruel ruler, and for this reason about</p>

<p><span class="year">9</span> is murdered. The Parthians apply to Rome and receive <b>Vonones I</b>, eldest son of
Phraates IV, as their king. His long residence in Rome and foreign sympathies
make him unpopular in Parthia, and</p>

<p><span class="year">11</span> <b>Artabanus III</b>, an Arsacid on his mother’s side and who had been king of Media
(Atropatene), is set up as a pretender. He is unsuccessful at first, but finally defeats
Vonones at Ctesiphon. The latter flees and is chosen king of Armenia in 16.
Tiberius persuades him to give up this throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">19</span> After death of Germanicus, Artabanus begins to treat the Romans with contempt, and
places his son Arsaces on the throne of Armenia. He makes so severe a ruler that</p>

<p><span class="year">35</span> the Parthians apply to Tiberius, who finds himself compelled to interfere. He induces
Pharasmanes, king of Iberia, to put forward his brother Mithridates as a claimant
to the Armenian throne. War results.</p>

<p><span class="year">36</span> A widespread revolt instigated by Tiberius puts Tiridates, grandson of Phraates IV,
on the throne and Artabanus flees.</p>

<p><span class="year">37</span> Artabanus comes to terms with Rome and is restored.</p>

<p><span class="year">40</span> Death of Artabanus. His son <b>Vardanes</b> succeeds, but is deposed</p>

<p><span class="year">41</span> by <b>Gotarzes</b>, chief official of Artabanus.</p>

<p><span class="year">42</span> Vardanes recovers throne, owing to Gotarzes’ cruelties. Civil war results.</p>

<p><span class="year">43</span> Vardanes captures Seleucia, and Gotarzes retires to Hyrcania.</p>

<p><span class="year">45</span> Gotarzes makes unsuccessful attempt to regain throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">46</span> Vardanes murdered while hunting. Gotarzes again takes throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">47</span> On account of Gotarzes’ misrule, the Parthians ask Claudius to give them Meherdates
(Mithridates V) son of Vonones as king.</p>

<p><span class="year">50</span> Gotarzes captures Meherdates on his way to Parthia.</p>

<p><span class="year">51</span> Death of Gotarzes succeeded by <b>Vonones II</b>, formerly king of Media and probably
brother of Artabanus III.</p>

<p><span class="year">54</span> Death of Vonones succeeded by his eldest son, <b>Vologases I</b>, who is the son of a
concubine; but to compensate his brothers, Vologases puts Pacorus on the throne of
Media and Tiridates on that of Armenia&mdash;having deposed Radamistus the usurper
from the latter country. A son of Vardanes contests the throne with Vologases and
apparently has the upper hand for a while.</p>

<p><span class="year">55</span> The Romans compel the Parthians to evacuate Armenia.</p>

<p><span class="year">58</span> Vologases again attacks Armenia and brings on war with Rome. Revolt of Hyrcania.
Corbulo destroys Artaxarta and occupies Tigranocerta (59).</p>

<p><span class="year">61</span> Peace restored in Hyrcania.</p>

<p><span class="year">62</span> War with Rome resumed. The Romans are repulsed.</p>

<p><span class="year">63</span> Corbulo crosses the Euphrates, and the Parthians sue for peace.</p>

<p><span class="year">72</span> The Alani drive Pacorus of Media from his throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">75</span> The Alani enter Parthia. Vologases appeals in vain to Vespasian.</p>

<p><span class="year">78</span> About this date Vologases dies. He seems to have been succeeded by two kings,
<b>Vologases II</b> and <b>Pacorus II</b>, probably brothers, and reigning together.</p>

<p><span class="year">81</span> <b>Artabanus IV</b> appears to be the king in this year. He protects Terentius Maximus,
who pretends to be Nero. Parthia is torn with civil wars.</p>

<p><span class="year">93</span> Pacorus II is sole king.</p>

<p><span class="year">110</span> Pacorus sells the crown of Edessa to Abgar VII. Death of Pacorus. His brother (or
perhaps son) <b>Chosroes</b> or <b>Osroes</b> succeeds. Vologases II reappears as a rival king,
also a <b>Mithridates</b> or <b>Meherdates VI</b>. Parthia is completely upset with civil war
which goes on until</p>

<h4>THE EMPIRE OF THE SASSANIDS (228-651 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h4>

<p>While the Arsacids were ruling their kingdom and lording it over the minor kings
of the neighbouring country, the rulers of Persis (or Persia proper) seem to have
occupied an isolated position and not been included in the Parthian empire. At the
beginning of the third century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> the kings of Persia have lost all power of keeping
the empire together; all the land is ruled by a number of local potentates. One
of these is Pabak, son and descendant of a certain Sasan of Khir. Pabak conquers
considerable territory beyond his own dominions. On his death the succession of
Shapur or Sapor, the eldest son, is disputed by Ardashir, a younger son. Sapor
dies suddenly and Ardashir puts his other brother to death, and settles himself on
his throne in 211 or 212 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> About 224 he invades the land of the “great king”
Artabanus IV of Parthia, and by 228 the conquest is complete and the title of
“great king” devolves upon Ardashir. He makes his capital at Ctesiphon.</p>

<p><span class="year">228</span> Foundation of the Sassanian empire by <b>Ardashir</b> or <b>Artaxerxes</b>. He passes his
reign in extending and consolidating his empire.</p>

<p><span class="year">236-238</span> War with Rome. Nisibis and Carrhæ taken.</p>

<p><span class="year">241</span> Death of Ardashir. His son <b>Shapur</b> or <b>Sapor I</b> succeeds.</p>

<p><span class="year">242</span> Sapor penetrates to Antioch but is driven back by the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="year">244</span> Philippus concludes a humiliating peace with Sapor. Peace reigns until</p>

<p><span class="year">251</span> when Sapor invades Armenia and puts the king to flight. The Persians now make
repeated invasions of Syria.</p>

<p><span class="year">258</span> The Roman emperor Valerian takes the field against the Persians.</p>

<p><span class="year">260</span> Capture of Valerian by Sapor. He proceeds towards Asia Minor but is repulsed by
Odenathus, king of Palmyra, who lays siege to Ctesiphon. Sapor acquires no
permanent gain of territory. In his reign Mani preaches his doctrines tending to
the amalgamation of Christianity and Zoroastrianism, and leading to the formation
of the Manichæan sect.</p>

<p><span class="year">272 or 273</span> Sapor succeeded by his son <b>Hormuz</b> (<b>Hormizd</b>) or <b>Hormisdas I</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">282</span> with a peace with Probus.</p>

<p><span class="year">283</span> After murder of Probus, Carus invades Persia, takes Ctesiphon and Coche, and dies
suddenly. There are civil wars, probably led by a brother of the king, assisted by
the barbarous tribes in the northwest.</p>

<p><span class="year">294</span> Death of Bahram. The throne seems to be contested by <b>Bahram</b> or <b>Varanes III</b>,

and most of his family are slain. His eldest son <b>Kavadh (Kobad) II</b>, or

<h4>THE ARABS</h4>

<h5>THE PRE-MOHAMMEDAN ERA</h5>

<p>Before the Mohammedan conquests, Arabia is divided into a number of local monarchies.
In these we recognise two distinct origins.</p>

<p>(1) Those ruled by a race of southern origin&mdash;the genuine or Kahtanee Arabs. Their
monarchies form a rim around the wild and desert centre of the peninsula.</p>

<p>(2) The centre of Arabia is occupied by nomadic races&mdash;the Mustareb Arabs, of northern
origin, descendants of a mythical Adnan.</p>

<h5>THE KAHTANEE KINGDOMS (<i>ca.</i> 380 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-634 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>The kingdom of Yemen is the most important and powerful of these. It occupies a
portion of the ancient Arabia Felix. Descendants of Kahtan and Himyar&mdash;names
of African origin&mdash;its monarchs rule over the whole of southern Arabia from about
380 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, with but few interruptions. The capital is first at Mareb and then at
Sana. The northern kingdoms are more or less tributary. The Persians, Greeks,
and Macedonians make no attempts upon Arabia, if we except the frontier skirmishes
of Antigonus and Ptolemy. Rome had an eye to its conquest. Pompey,
the first to attempt it, is foiled, and it was not until</p>

<p><span class="smcapuc year">B.C.</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="year">25</span> when Ælius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt, undertakes an expedition at the command of
Augustus. His army is unable to support the hardships of the desert, and the following
year the Arabs drive the remnant out. Later attempts under Trajan and Severus do
not succeed beyond the frontier, and Bosrah and Petra mark the extreme limits of
Roman dominion.</p>

<p><span class="smcapuc year">A.D.</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="year">100</span> Probable date of the great flood of Arem or Mareb, which leads to the foundation
of other Arab kingdoms.</p>

<p><span class="year">529</span> The Abyssinians, under Aryat, invade Yemen, to avenge the Christians persecuted by
<b>Dhu-Nowas</b> the king. Dhu-Nowas is killed, and the Abyssinians rule the kingdom
until</p>

<p><span class="year">605</span> when Saif, with the assistance of Chosroes the Great, restores the Kahtanee dynasty,
but it becomes dependent on Persia.</p>

<p><span class="year">634</span> Mohammedan conquest of Yemen.</p>

<h5>THE KINGDOM OF HIRA (195-610 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>Next in importance to Yemen. It is situated in Irak. Founded about 195 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> by
<b>Malik</b>, it is more or less under allegiance to the Persians, but exercises considerable
control over the Mustareb Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="year">529</span> <b>Mundhir III</b>, king of Hira, who has been driven from the throne by Kavadh I of
Persia, because he is too powerful, invades Syria, cruelly ravaging the country as far
as Antioch. He kills Harith, whom Kavadh has set over his kingdom, and is finally
himself killed, in 554, by a Roman vassal.</p>

<p><span class="year">610</span> Chosroes II puts an end to the kingdom of Hira.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<h5>THE KINGDOM OF GHASSAN (300-636 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>Founded about 300 by <b>Thalaba</b>, the first to take the name of king. His successors
rule until 636, when <b>Djabala VI</b> surrenders to the Mohammedans.</p>

<h5>THE KINGDOM OF KINDEH</h5>

<p>A small kingdom, of Yemenite origin, which detaches itself from Irak in the fifth
century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> and maintains its existence for about 160 years, when it is absorbed by
the Mustarebs.</p>

<h5>THE MUSTAREB KINGDOMS</h5>

<p>The northern tribes inhabiting central Arabia, or Arabia Petræa, become consolidated
into five kingdoms:</p>

<p>Rabiah, in the east centre of the peninsula.</p>

<p>Kais, or Kais-Ailan, in the north.</p>

<p>Hawazin, in the north.</p>

<p>Tamin, in the middle.</p>

<p>They are, from the time of their foundation, more or less tributary to Yemen until</p>

<p><span class="year">500</span> They make themselves independent, under the leadership of Kolaib, who now tries to
unite his people in a single confederacy, but the plan is frustrated by his assassination.
The tribes now lead a warlike, disorganised existence, encroaching slowly
upon the Kahtanee kingdoms. During this period the tribe of Koreish becomes
prominent. Tradition assigns their origin to Ishmael, and they have become the
guardians of the sacred Kaaba. This gives them pre-eminence over all other Arabian
clans, and at the beginning of the seventh century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> the tribe of Koreish and its
Mustareb allies is the most powerful confederacy in Arabia, the Kahtanee kingdoms
having become more or less vassals of the Persian and Byzantine empires.</p>

<h5>THE KINGDOM OF NABATÆA</h5>

<p>The Nabatæans are a famous people of ancient Arabia. Secure knowledge of their
history goes back only to 312 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, when Antigonus failed to take their fortress of
Petra. They are described by Diodorus as a pastoral and trading people, preserving
their liberty in the arid country of Arabia Petræa. At the fall of the Seleucids they
extend their territory over the fertile country east of the Jordan. They occupy the
Hauran. Pompey reduces them to vassalage, and in 105 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Trajan takes Petra
and breaks up the Nabatæan nation.</p>

<h5>MOHAMMED AND HIS SUCCESSORS (570-661 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p><span class="year"><i>ca.</i> 570</span> Birth of <b>Mohammed</b>, of a noble Koreish family, at Mecca.</p>

Empire. Abu Bekr reduces a revolt in Nejd and Yemen, and defends Medina.</p>

<h5>THE INDEPENDENT KINGDOMS, OR EMIRATES (1031-1091 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>Since the death of Almansor, Mohammedan Spain has been splitting up into a number
of independent emirates or principalities. The fall of the Omayyad dynasty breaks
the last link of unity, and we have now the separate and distinct emirates of Saragossa,
Toledo, Valencia, Badajoz, Cordova, Seville, and Granada. The Christian
states seize the opportunity to reconquer Spain. The Spanish national hero, “the
Cid,” takes part in these conquests. Without following each of these states in detail,
we note the most important events of the period.</p>

<h4>THE KINGDOM OF ARMENIA (189 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-1375 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h4>

<p>The Armenians throw off the Macedonian yoke in 317 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, choosing Ardvates as king.
He dies about 284, and the country returns to Seleucid rule. In 189 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> (according
to Roman historians), after the defeat of Antiochus the Great by Rome, <b>Artaxias</b>
or <b>Ardashes</b> and <b>Zadriades</b>, the governors of Armenia Major and Armenia Minor
respectively, become independent kings with the connivance of Rome. Artaxias
rules at Artaxarta. Hannibal takes refuge at his court.</p>

<p><span class="smcapuc year">B.C.</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="year">166</span> Antiochus IV takes Artaxias prisoner, but restores him to his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="year">149</span> According to Armenian historians Mithridates I of Parthia establishes his brother
Valarsaces (Waharshag) on the Armenian throne and the Arsacid dynasty of
Armenia is founded. Following the Armenian king list</p>

<p><span class="year">127</span> <b>Arshag I</b> succeeds his father.</p>

<p><span class="year">114</span> <b>Artaces</b> succeeds his father.</p>

<p><span class="year">94</span> <b>Tigranes I (II)</b> succeeds his father. He is the next king mentioned by Roman
historians. He is put on the disputed throne by Mithridates II the Great of Parthia.
Tigranes removes the capital to Tigranocerta, and conquers Lesser Armenia and
many Parthian provinces. He assumes the title “King of Kings.”</p>

<p><span class="year">83</span> Tigranes makes himself master of the whole of Syria, having been invited by the
Syrians to put an end to the civil strife among the Seleucid princes.</p>

<p><span class="year">76</span> Tigranes’ father-in-law Mithridates the Great of Pontus instigates him to invade
Cappadocia.</p>

<p><span class="year">69</span> Tigranes refuses to surrender Mithridates to the Romans. War with Rome results,
and Lucullus defeats him at Tigranocerta.</p>

<p><span class="year">66</span> Tigranes surrenders his conquests to Pompey. Armenia becomes a vassal state of
Rome. The Parthian monarch recovers the title “King of Kings.”</p>

<p><span class="year">64</span> Defeat of Tigranes by Phraates III of Parthia. Pompey settles their dispute.</p>

<p><span class="year">56</span> Death of Tigranes. His son <b>Artavasdes I</b> succeeds. He is the ally of Rome in
Crassus’ campaign against the Parthians.</p>

<p><span class="year">36</span> Artavasdes joins the Romans in the campaign against Artavasdes of Media. He
deserts Antony and the expedition fails.</p>

<p><span class="year">34</span> In revenge Antony proceeds against Artavasdes and captures him. His son <b>Artaxias
II</b> is placed on the throne. He is defeated by the Romans and flees to Parthia. He
soon recovers the throne and massacres all the Romans in Armenia.</p>

<p><span class="year">20</span> The discontented Armenians complain to Augustus about Artaxias and ask that his
brother Tigranes, then at Rome, be made their king. Tiberius Nero is sent after
Artaxias, who is murdered by his relatives, and <b>Tigranes II (III)</b> is crowned by
Tiberius. After a short reign Tigranes is succeeded by his son <b>Tigranes III (IV)</b>.
The land is full of civil discord.</p>

<p><span class="year">6</span> Augustus places Tigranes’ brother <b>Artavasdes II</b> on the Armenian throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">5</span> Tigranes recovers his kingdom. Both kings seem to rule simultaneously. They are
finally driven out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p><span class="year">2</span> <b>Ariobazanes</b> or, according to some historians, <b>Tigranes IV (V)</b> is placed by Augustus
on the disputed throne. He may have been a Mede or perhaps an Armenian exile.</p>

<p><span class="smcapuc year">A.D.</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="year">2</span> Death of Ariobazanes. <b>Erato</b>, probably widow of Tigranes III (IV), succeeds.</p>

<p><span class="year">4</span> According to Armenian historians a son of Ariobazanes (Artavasdes III) takes the
throne from Erato, but she regains it in a few months. After Erato’s death or
deposition (date uncertain) and a short interregnum,</p>

<p><span class="year">16</span> <b>Vonones</b> the exiled monarch of Parthia is chosen king, but Tiberius persuades him to
retire to Syria.</p>

<p><span class="year">18</span> <b>Artaxias III</b> chosen king after a short interregnum. He is succeeded by (date
unknown) <b>Arsaces I</b>, placed on the throne by his father Artabanus III of Parthia.</p>

<p><span class="year">35</span> Death of Arsaces through treachery of Mithridates, brother of Pharasmanes king of
Iberia. <b>Mithridates</b> invades Armenia, and Tiberius gives him the throne.
Caligula summons him to Rome, imprisons him, but restores him about 47.</p>

<p><span class="year">52</span> Mithridates slain by his nephew <b>Rhadamistus</b> of Iberia.</p>

<p><span class="year">54</span> Vologases I of Parthia expels Rhadamistus and makes his own brother <b>Tiridates I</b>
king.</p>

<p><span class="year">58</span> Corbulo drives out Tiridates I and puts Tigranes V (VI) Herodes the Cappadocian on
the throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">61</span> Vologases crowns Tiridates king of Armenia and proceeds against Tigranes.</p>

<p><span class="year">66</span> Tiridates goes to Rome to receive the crown as a gift from Nero. Meanwhile, <b>Erorant</b>,
of the younger Arsacid branch, has established himself, about 58, over a large
portion of Armenia. He is the contemporary of Tiridates, and after the latter’s
death, probably rules the whole country. He cedes Edessa and Mesopotamia to the
Romans.</p>

<p><span class="year">78</span> <b>Exeardes</b>, son of Pacorus II of Parthia, is appointed to the throne. He is several
times driven out, but always manages to recover his throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">112</span> Osroes, brother of Mithridates VI of Parthia, expels Exeardes and makes <b>Parthamasiris</b>,
another son of Pacorus, king, for which act Trajan invades Armenia.
Parthamasiris is humbled.</p>

<p><span class="year">117</span> Trajan appoints <b>Parthamaspates</b>, son of Oroes, king. He is expelled, and recovers
the kingdom from Hadrian. He is succeeded by his son, <b>Achæmenides</b>, and he in
turn by <b>Soemus</b> or <b>Sohæmus</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">162</span> Vologases III of Parthia expels Sohæmus, who is friendly to Rome, and makes
<b>Pacorus</b> king.</p>

<p><span class="year">163 or 164</span> Sohæmus restored by the Romans, and is succeeded (date unknown) by his son,
<b>Sanatruces</b> or <b>Sanadrug</b>, who is established on the throne by Septimius Severus.</p>

<p><span class="year">212</span> Caracalla seizes Sanatruces.</p>

<p>Armenian historians speak of a Chosroes I, the Great, who rules about this time, but
the Romans do not mention him. Sanatruces seems to have been followed by
<b>Vologases</b>, his son, and he in turn by his son <b>Tiridates II</b>, who escapes from the
Romans to Vologases V of Parthia, about 227. His successor is <b>Arsaces II</b>, brother
of Artabanus IV of Parthia. He wars against Ardashir, the Sassanid.</p>

<p><span class="year">258</span> Sapor I of Persia puts <b>Artavasdes III</b> on the Armenian throne.</p>

<p><span class="year">285</span> About this date <b>Tiridates III</b>, the rightful heir of the throne and a Christian, is
established by Diocletian. Narseh expels him after a few years, and this brings on
a war between Persia and Rome. Tiridates is restored.</p>

<p><span class="year">341</span> Probably at this date <b>Arsaces III</b> ascends the throne, after his father, Tiridates III,
has been imprisoned by Sapor II of Persia. He assists Sapor in his wars with Rome,
and then allies himself with Rome.</p>

<p><span class="year">363</span> Arsaces deserts the Romans in the siege of Ctesiphon. He is seized by Sapor, and
imprisoned. Sapor puts <b>Aspacures</b> on the throne, but <b>Para</b>, son of Arsaces, is also
acknowledged king, with the help of the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="year">374 or 377</span> Valens, dissatisfied with Para, has him put to death. Para’s nephew, <b>Arsaces
IV</b>, succeeds, together with a brother, <b>Valarsaces II</b>, who dies soon. Arsaces proves
so weak a ruler that Theodosius the Great and Sapor III decide to divide the
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="year">387 or 390</span> Division of Armenia between Rome and Persia. Arsaces continues to reign in
the Roman dominions. Sapor gives his (the eastern) portion to a Persian noble,
<b>Khosrau</b>, or <b>Chosroes</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">389</span> Death of Arsaces IV. Theodosius confers his portion upon his general, <b>Casavon</b>,
who plots with Chosroes to bring all Armenia under Roman dominion. Bahram IV
of Persia seizes Chosroes and</p>

<p><span class="year">392</span> puts the latter’s brother, <b>Bahram Sapor</b>, on the vassal throne of eastern Armenia.</p>

<p><span class="year">414</span> Chosroes restored by Yezdegerd I.</p>

<p><span class="year">415</span> Death of Chosroes. Yezdegerd’s son, <b>Sapor</b>, becomes king.</p>

<p><span class="year">429</span> The Armenian nobles apply to Bahram to remove Artasires. The Persian king decides
to make Armenia a province, and deposes Artasires. Henceforth the province is
known as Pers-Armenia.</p>

<p>From 429 to 632 Armenia is ruled by Persian governors, who are remarkable chiefly
for their cruel attempts to subvert Christianity.</p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I. THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE</h3>

<div class="sidenote">[250 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-228 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The battle of Arbela (331 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) made Alexander the heir of the Persian
Empire. In the volumes devoted to Grecian history we have shown how he
verified his claims of conquest, subdivided his empire among satraps of his own
appointment, and left the enormous heritage, when he died, to “the best man.”
It was further shown how no one man among the generals of the Alexandrian
school could prove himself the best man, and how, in consequence,
the empire fell into a chaos of civil wars until at last certain major divisions
assumed a particularly definite form&mdash;among them the Ptolemaic Egypt,
and the Iran of Seleucus and his family the Seleucidæ, among whom the
name Antiochus frequently appears, the city of Antioch in Syria being
taken as a capital. The degeneracy of these rulers was the opportunity of
the obscure race of Parthians, who, with qualities and customs that in many
ways remind one of the American Indian, rose to a power so great that
under the first Cæsars the Romans thought of them as dividing the power
of the world with Rome.</p>

<p>The only continuous ancient history of this race is that of Justin, which
ends with the year 9 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> and shows a gap between 94 and 55 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> We
quote this unique account entire; but the reader is cautioned that it is not
to be given full credence everywhere: it is introductory to the more
critical modern account that follows.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Justin’s Account of the Parthians</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">[331-9 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>The Parthians, who are now in possession of the empire of the East, having,
as it were, divided the world with the Romans, came originally from Scythian
exiles. This too is evident from their name: for in the Scythian language
the word <i>Parthi</i> signifies exiles. This nation, in the times both of the Assyrians
and Medes, was the obscurest in the East. Afterwards too, when the empire
of the East was transferred from the Medes to the Persians, they were
an easy prey to the conquerors, like a vulgar herd without a name. At last,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
they came under the Macedonian yoke, when they carried their triumphant
arms into these parts of the world; so that it is really strange that they
should have arrived to such power as to rule over those nations, whose slaves
they had formerly been.</p>

<p>Being thrice attacked by the Romans, under the conduct of their greatest
generals, in the most flourishing times of the republic, they alone of all
nations were not only a match for them, but came off victorious; yet perhaps
it was still a greater glory for them to be able to rise, amidst the Assyrian,
Median, and Persian kingdoms, so famous of old, and the most opulent
empire of Bactria, consisting of a thousand cities, than that they defeated a
people that came from so remote a part of the world; especially when at that
time they were incessantly alarmed by the Scythians and their other neighbours,
and exposed to so many uncertainties of war. They being forced to
leave Scythia by seditions at home did, by stealth,
possess themselves of the deserts between Hyrcania,
the Dahæ, the Arians, the Spartans, and
Margians. After which, their neighbours not resisting
at first, they at last, in spite of their opposition,
when they came too late to hinder them, so
far extended their frontiers that they not only
took possession of vast plains, but also of craggy
hills and steep mountains. And hence it comes
that the heat and cold are excessive in several
provinces of Parthia; for the snow is troublesome
in the mountainous parts, and the heat in the
plains.</p>

<h4>THEIR CUSTOMS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[323-250 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p048.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Parthian Noble</span></p>
</div>

<p>This nation was under kingly government,
after their revolt from the Macedonian Empire.
With them the chiefs of the populace were next in
power to the king. Out of them were chosen their
generals in war and their governors in peace.
Their language is a mixture of the Median and
Scythian, borrowing words from both. Their
habit was formerly very particular; but after they
were increased in power, it was like that of the
Medes, full flowing and thin. They are armed
like the Scythians, from whom they are descended.
Their armies are not, like those of other nations,
composed wholly of freemen, but chiefly of slaves;
the numbers of which increase prodigiously, none
having the power of manumitting. They treat
these with as much care as their children, and teach them with great industry
both riding and shooting. Everyone furnishes his prince with horsemen,
in proportion to his ability. To conclude, when fifty thousand horsemen met
Antony, upon his attacking the Parthians, four hundred of them only were
freemen. They are ignorant of the art of besieging towns, or of engaging
in close fight. They fight on horseback, sometimes advancing, and sometimes
turning back upon their enemies. They often counterfeit flight, that
they may have an advantage of their pursuers, less upon their guard. The
signal for battle is not given by trumpet, but by drum. They do not hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
out long in fight; and indeed it would be impossible to stand before them,
if their perseverance was equal to the fury of their onset. For the most
part, they quit the battle in the very heat of an engagement, and on the
sudden renew it with great vehemence; so that one is in greatest danger
from them when he thinks he has conquered them. A sort of strong coats,
made of little plates, in the fashion of feathers, are used by them, to cover
both them and their horses. They use no gold nor silver, but only in their
arms.</p>

<p>Each particular man was allowed to have several wives, for the pleasure
of variety; and they punish no crime so severely as adultery. To prevent it,
they not only exclude their women from their feasts, but forbid them the
very sight of men. They eat no flesh, but what they take by hunting.
They ride on horseback at all times; on horse they go to feasts; pay civilities,
public and private; march out, stand still, traffic, converse. This, in fine, is
the difference between slaves and freemen, that the slaves go on foot, the
freemen on horseback. Their common way of sepulture is being devoured
by dogs or birds, and after that, burying the bare bones in the ground. In
their superstition and worship of the gods, the principal veneration is paid to
rivers.</p>

<p>The nation is naturally proud, treacherous, seditious, and insolent; for
a boisterous rough behaviour they think manly. Gentleness, they think,
belongs to women, as their character. They are restless to be engaged in
some quarrel, at home or abroad; taciturn by temper, and more ready to act
than speak; wherefore they conceal their good or bad fortune by their
silence. They are strictly subject to their princes, not out of duty however
but through fear. They are much addicted to lust, though very temperate
in their diet; and they pay no more regard to their word, than suits with
their interest.</p>

<h4>SELEUCUS AND ARSACES</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[250-155 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>After the death of Alexander the Great, when the kingdoms of the East
were divided amongst his successors, because none of the Macedonians would
condescend to accept of the kingdom of the Parthians, it was delivered to
Stasanor, a foreign ally. And afterwards, when the Macedonians were
involved in a civil war, they, with the rest of the nations of upper Asia, followed
Eumenes; and when he was defeated, they went over to Antigonus.
After him, they were under Nicator Seleucus; and soon after, under Antiochus
and his successors; from whose grandson Seleucus they first revolted in
the First Punic War, when L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus were
consuls. The divisions of the two brothers, Seleucus and Antiochus, procured
them an immunity for this revolt, who during their contentions to
wrest the sceptre out of one another’s hands, neglected to pursue the revolters.
At the same time Theodotus too, the governor of the thousand cities
of Bactria, revolted, and commanded himself to be called king; which
example all the Eastern nations soon followed, and shook off the Macedonian
yoke.</p>

<p>There was, at this time, one Arsaces, a man of tried valour, though of
uncertain extraction. He, being accustomed to live by robbery and plunder,
having heard that Seleucus had been overthrown by the Gauls in Asia, fearing
the king no longer, entered the country of the Parthians with a band of
robbers, defeated and killed Andragoras his lieutenant, and seized the
government of the whole country. Not long after, he likewise made himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
master of Hyrcania; and being now in possession of two kingdoms, he raised
a great army, for fear of Seleucus and Theodotus king of the Bactrians.
But being soon delivered from his fears by the death of Theodotus, he made
peace and entered into an alliance with his son, who was likewise named
Theodotus: and not long after, engaging with King Seleucus, who came to
punish the revolters, he had a victory; and this day the Parthians observe
ever since with great solemnity, as the commencement of their liberty.</p>

<p>Some new disturbances obliging Seleucus to return into Asia, some respite
was by this means given to Arsaces, who took this opportunity to establish
the Parthian government, levy soldiers, fortify castles, and secure the fidelity
of his cities. He built a city too, called Dara, upon the mountain Zapaortenon;
which was so situated that no city could be stronger or pleasanter.
For it was so environed with rough rocks on all sides, that it needed no
garrison to defend it; and so fertile was the adjacent soil, that it was abundantly
furnished with all necessaries by its own riches. Then there were in
such plenty woods and fountains, that there was never any scarcity of water;
and it had vast store of game. Thus Arsaces, having at once acquired and
established a kingdom, was no less memorable among the Parthians than
Cyrus among the Persians, Alexander among the Macedonians, or Romulus
among the Romans; and he died in a good old age. To his memory the
Parthians paid this honour, that from him they called all their kings by
the name of Arsaces. His son and successor in the kingdom, who was Arsaces
by name, fought with great bravery against Antiochus the son of Seleucus,
who came against him with a hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand
horse; and at last made an alliance with him. The third king of the Parthians
was Priapatius; but he too was named Arsaces; for, as was said
above, they called all their kings by that name, as the Romans do theirs
Cæsar and Augustus. He died, after he had reigned fifteen years, leaving
two sons, Mithridates and Phraates, the elder of whom, Phraates, being
according to the custom of this nation heir of the kingdom, subdued by his
arms the Mardians, a strong nation, and died not long after, leaving several
sons behind him, whom he passed by, and left his kingdom to his brother
Mithridates, a man of uncommon abilities; judging that more was due to the
name of king than that of father; and that he ought to prefer the interest
of his country to the grandeur of his children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[155-54 <i>B.C.</i>]</div>

<p>Almost at the same time, as Mithridates among the Parthians so Eucratides
amongst the Bactrians, both princes of great merit, began to reign.
But the uncommon good fortune of the Parthians brought them, under this
monarch, to the highest pitch of greatness. The Bactrians, on the other
hand, being distressed by several wars, not only lost their sovereignty, but
their liberty; for being exhausted by wars with the Sogdians, Drangians,
and Indians, were, like a people quite enfeebled and expiring, subdued by the
Persians, who had been a little before much weaker than they. However,
Eucratides carried on many wars with great vigour; and though his losses had
much weakened him, yet being besieged by Demetrius, king of the Indians,
with only three hundred soldiers he made continual sallies, and so fatigued
the enemy, consisting of forty thousand men, that he obliged them to raise the
siege. Wherefore, being delivered from the siege, in the fifth month he reduced
India under his power; but in his return from thence, he was assassinated
by his son, whom he had made his partner in the kingdom; who was
so far from concealing the parricide that, as if he had killed an enemy and
not his father, he drove his chariot through his blood, and ordered his body
to be thrown out unburied. During these transactions in Bactria, a war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
broke out between the Parthians and the Medes. After the success of this
war had for some time been various, victory at last fell to the Parthians.
Mithridates, enforced with this addition to his strength, set Bacasis over
Media, and went himself into Hyrcania; from whence returning, he made
war upon the king of the Elymæans; and, after the conquest of him, he
added this nation likewise to his dominions; and so extended the Parthian
Empire from Mount Caucasus as far as the river Euphrates, by reducing many
nations under his yoke. After this, being seized with an illness, he died in
an honourable old age, not at all inferior in glory to his great-grandfather
Arsaces.</p>

<p>After the death of Mithridates, king of Parthia, Phraates his son succeeded
to the kingdom; who being resolved to revenge himself upon Antiochus
for attacking the kingdom of Parthia, was recalled by disturbances
from Scythia, to defend his own country. For the Scythians, being invited
by promises to assist the Parthians against Antiochus, king of Syria, having
arrived after the war was ended, were frustrated of their promised reward,
under the idle pretence of their coming too late; and it made the Scythians
so angry that they should have had so long a march for nothing, that they
demanded either pay for their trouble or that some other enemy should be
allotted them. The haughty reply given to this demand so enraged them,
that they began to ravage the country of the Parthians.</p>

<p>Wherefore Phraates, marching against them, left one Hymerus, who had
recommended himself to his favour by prostituting the bloom of his youth
to his infamous lust, the care of his kingdom in his absence. This governor,
forgetting his past life and the trust he was charged with, miserably harassed
the Babylonians, and many other cities, by his tyrannical cruelties. But
Phraates himself carried along with him to the war an army of Greeks,
which he had taken in the war against Antiochus, and treated with great
pride and barbarity; not at all considering that their hatred to him was so
far from being lessened by their captivity, that they were rather more exasperated
against him by the indignity of the outrages they had suffered.
Wherefore, when they saw the army of the Parthians give ground, they
joined their arms with those of the enemy, and executed their long wished-for
revenge for their captivity by the bloody havoc they made on the
Parthian army, and by the death of King Phraates himself.</p>

<p>Artabanus his uncle was made king in his room; but the Scythians being
content with victory, having laid waste Parthia, returned home. But Artabanus,
in a war made upon the Thogarians, received a wound in his arm, of
which he died immediately. He was succeeded by his son Mithridates, to
whom his exploits gained the surname of Great; for, being fired with a
brave emulation of his forefathers, he surpassed their fame by the greatness
of his soul. Accordingly, he carried on many wars against his neighbours
with signal gallantry, and added many provinces to the Parthian Empire.
Not satisfied with this, he often had war with the Scythians; and by the
victories he obtained over them revenged the injury his father had received
from them. At last, he employed his arms against Ortoadistes, king of the
Armenians.</p>

<h4>WARS WITH ROME</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[54-36 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>After the war of Armenia, Mithridates, king of the Parthians, was banished
his kingdom for his cruelty, by the Parthian senate. Orodes his brother,
having possessed himself of the vacant throne, besieged Babylon, to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
city this fugitive prince had fled; and after a long siege forced the people,
by famine, to surrender. Mithridates, relying upon his being so nearly related
to Orodes, voluntarily gave himself up to him; but Orodes, considering
him rather as an enemy than a brother, commanded him to be killed in his
own presence; and after these things carried on a war with the Romans, and
cut to pieces their general Crassus, together with his son and all his army.
His son Pacorus being sent to pursue the remainder of the Roman war, after
he had performed very great actions in Syria was recalled by his father, who
was become jealous of him. In his absence, the Parthian army left in
Syria was cut off, with its commanders, by Cassius, paymaster to Crassus.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the civil wars between Cæsar and Pompey broke out, in
which the Parthians declared for the latter, because of the friendship contracted
with him in the Mithridatic War and because of Crassus’ death, whose son
they had heard was of Cæsar’s party, who they made no doubt would revenge
his father, if Cæsar proved conqueror. Wherefore Pompey’s party having
lost the day, they both sent assistance to Cassius and Brutus against Augustus
and Antony; and after the war was over, under their leader Pacorus,
making an alliance with Labienus, they laid waste Syria and Asia; and with
a mighty force attacked the camp of Ventidius, who, in the absence of Pacorus,
had routed the Parthian armies, as Cassius had done before him. But
Ventidius, counterfeiting fear, kept himself a long time in his camp, and for
some time suffered the Parthians to insult him. At last, he sent out some
of his legions against the enemy, now grown secure and off their guard and
full of joy, who, not able to resist them, fled several ways. Pacorus imagining
that the victorious legions had pursued the fliers too far, attacked Ventidius’
camp, as if there had been none left to defend it. Upon this, the Roman
general drew out the rest of his legions, killed Pacorus upon the spot, and
put the whole army of the Parthians to the sword, who never received so
great a blow in any of their wars.</p>

<p>When this news came to Parthia, Orodes, the father of Pacorus, who a
little before had heard that his troops had ravaged Syria, and conquered Asia,
and had boasted of his son as conqueror of the Romans, hearing on a sudden
of his son’s death and entire defeat of his army, was struck with grief that
threw him into a frenzy. For during several days he would speak to nobody;
so that he seemed to be dumb; nor would he take any refreshment. And
when his grief, at last, had found a vent, he called incessantly upon Pacorus;
Pacorus he fancied to appear to him, to speak to him, to stand with him, and
be heard by him. Sometimes he mournfully bewailed himself as lost; then,
after long mourning, another care seized this miserable old man, and that
was, whom of his thirty sons he should declare his successor in the room of
Pacorus. His many concubines, by whom he had so many sons, being each
concerned for her own, laid all of them very close siege to the king, each in
favour of her own; but the fate of Parthia, in which country it is now become
customary to have princes stained with the blood of their fathers and
brothers, would so have it that the choice fell upon the wickedest of them all,
Phraates too by name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[36-9 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Wherefore he immediately killed his father, thinking he would never die.
He likewise killed all his thirty brothers. Neither did his cruelty stop there:
for finding he was hated by the nobility for his daily barbarities, he ordered
his son, who was almost grown up to the years of maturity, to be slain; that
there might none be left to be proclaimed king. Antony made war upon
him with sixteen very able legions, because he had furnished assistance
against him and Cæsar; but being sadly mauled in several battles, he fled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
from Parthia. This victory making Phraates insupportably insolent and
cruel, he was forced by his people into banishment. After he had for a long
time wearied the neighbouring states, and at last the Scythians too, with his
importunity, he was restored to his kingdom by a powerful assistance from the
Scythians. In his absence, the Parthians had made one Tiridates their king,
who hearing of the approach of the Scythians, fled with a great body of his
friends to Cæsar, at that time waging war with Spain, bringing the youngest
son of Phraates as hostage to Cæsar, whom being negligently guarded he had
stolen away. Upon this news, Phraates immediately sent ambassadors to
Cæsar, and demanded that his son, together with his vassal Tiridates, should
be sent back to him.</p>

<p>Cæsar, having given audience to the ambassadors of Phraates and heard
the reasons of Tiridates, who desired to be restored to his crown, declaring
that the kingdom of Parthia would be in a manner subject to the Romans if
he held it from them, said that he would neither surrender Tiridates to the
Parthians, nor give assistance to Tiridates against the Parthians. However,
that he might not seem to refuse them everything they demanded, he sent
Phraates his son to him, without any ransom, and ordered a handsome
maintenance for Tiridates, so long as he had a mind to continue amongst
the Romans. After this, the Spanish War being ended, when he came
into Syria to settle the state of the East, Phraates was afraid that he might
have some designs upon Parthia. Wherefore the prisoners who had been
taken at the defeat of Crassus and Antony were gathered together, and
they, together with the military standards either of them had lost, were
sent back to Augustus. Nor was this all, but the sons and grandsons of
Phraates were likewise delivered as hostages to Augustus. And thus
Augustus did more by the terror of his name than any other general
could have done by his arms.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_1b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Modern Accounts of Parthia</span></h4>

<p>This is the history of the Parthians as given by Justin in his abridgement
of the lost work of Trogus Pompeius. Later investigations and criticism
have thrown a little light on various portions of the history, and
from the point where Justin grows briefest other Roman historians took up the
chronicles of the Parthians with avid interest. The study of coins has also
been of invaluable aid. It has seemed better to give Justin’s account in its
original fluency without interpolating criticisms here and there. Now, however,
we must make a brief presentation of Parthian history from the start in
a modern view.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h4>THE PARTHIAN EMPIRE</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[261-241 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Hellenism made no deep impression on Iran as on the West, nor did the
loose-jointed empire attain to anything higher than a Hellenistic reproduction
of the kingdom of the Achæmenians. Even in the fragmentary records
that we possess we hear from the first of rebellions little favourable to
consolidation of the realm; Seleucus, like Alexander, still had an army of
Macedonians and Persians together, while the later Seleucids, at least
in their western wars, used natives sparingly and only as bowmen, slingers,
or the like, and preferred for these services the wild desert and mountain
tribes of Iran.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Under the weak Antiochus II northeastern Iran was lost to the empire.
While the Seleucids were busy elsewhere, probably in the long war with
Ptolemy Philadelphus, which occupied Antiochus’ later years, Diodotus, viceroy
of Bactria, took the title of king. The new kingdom included Sogdiana
and Margiana from the first, while the rest of the East, with a single exception
scarcely noticed at the time, adhered to the Seleucids. Now the formation
of a strong local kingdom, heartily supported by the Greek colonies and
likely to control the neighbouring nomads and strictly to protect its own
frontiers, was by no means agreeable to the chief of the desert tribes who, like
the modern Turkomans, had been wont to pillage the settled lands and raise
blackmail with little hindrance from the weak and distant central authority
at Antioch. Accordingly two brothers, Arsaces and Tiridates&mdash;whose tribe,
the Parnians, a subdivision of the Dahæ, had hitherto pastured their flocks
in Bactria on the banks of the Ochus&mdash;moved west into Seleucid territory
near Parthia. An insult offered to the younger brother by the satrap Pherecles
moved them to revolt; Pherecles was slain, and Parthia freed from the
Macedonians.</p>

<h4>ARSACES AND THE ARSACIDS</h4>

<p>Arsaces was then proclaimed first king of Parthia (250 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). Such is
the later official tradition, and we possess no other account of the beginnings
of the Arsacid dynasty. But when the official account transforms Arsaces,
who according to genuine tradition was the leader of a robber horde and of
uncertain descent, into a Bactrian, the descendant of Phriapites son of Artaxerxes
II (who was called Arsaces before his accession), and makes him conspire
with his brother and five others, like the seven who slew the false
Smerdis, we detect the invention of a period when the Arsacids had entered
on the inheritance of the Achæmenians, and imitated the order of their court.
The seven conspirators are the heads of the seven noble houses to whom, beyond
doubt, the Karen, the Suren, and the Aspahapet belonged. And further,
genuine tradition does not know the first Arsaces as king of Parthia at
all, and as late as 105 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> the Parthians themselves reckoned the year
(autumn) 248-247 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> as the first of their empire. But 248 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> is the
year in which Arsaces I is said to have been killed, after a reign of two years,
and succeeded by his brother; who, like all subsequent kings of the line, took
the throne name of Arsaces.</p>

<p>The first Arsaces must have existed, for he appears as deified on the
reverse of his brother’s drachmæ, but he was not king of Parthia. Nay, we
have authentic record that even in the epoch-year 248-247 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, the year of
the accession of Tiridates, Parthia was still under the Seleucids. These contradictions
are solved by a notice of Isidore of Charax, which names a city
Asaak, not in Parthia but northwest of it, in the neighbouring Astauene,
where Arsaces was proclaimed king and where an everlasting fire was kept
burning. This, therefore, was the first seat of the monarchy, and Pherecles
was presumably satrap of Astauene, not eparch of Parthia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[241-238 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>The times were not favourable for the reduction of the rebels. When
Antiochus II died, the horrors that accompanied the succession of his son
Seleucus (II) Callinicus (246-226 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) gave the king of Egypt the pretext
for a war, in which he overran almost the whole lands of the Seleucids as far
as Bactria. Meantime a civil war was raging between Seleucus and his brother
Antiochus Hierax, whom the Galatians supported, and at the great battle of
Ancyra in 242 or 241 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Seleucus was totally defeated and thought to be slain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
At this news Arsaces Tiridates, whom the genuine tradition still represents as
a brave robber-chief, broke into Parthia at the head of the Parnians, slew the
Macedonian eparch Andragoras, and took possession of the province. These
Parnian Dahæ, in consequence of eternal dissensions, had migrated at a remote
date to Hyrcania and the desert adjoining the Caspian. Here, and in great
measure even after they conquered Parthia, they retained the peculiarities of
Scythian nomads.</p>

<h4>PARTHIAN CUSTOMS</h4>

<p>The common tradition connects the migration with the conquests of the
Scythian king Iandysus, a contemporary of Sesostris [Ramses II]. It adds
that Parthian means “fugitive” or “exile” (<i>Zend</i>, <i>peretu</i>). But the name
Parthava is found on the inscriptions of Darius long before the immigration
of the Parnians. The Parthian language is described as a sort of compound
between Median and Scythian; and, since the name of the Dahæ and those
of their tribes show that they belong to the nomads of Iranian kin, who in
antiquity were widely spread from the Jaxartes as far as the steppes of south
Russia, we must conclude that the mixed language arose by the action and
reaction of two Iranian dialects, that of the Parthians and that of their
masters. Their nomad costume the Parnians in Parthia gradually gave up
for the Median dress, but they kept their old war-dress, the characteristic
scale-armour completely covering man and horse. The founder of the
empire appears on coins in this dress, with the addition of a short mantle;
and so again does Mithridates II. The hands and feet alone are unprotected
by mail; shoes with laces, and a conical helmet with flaps to protect
the neck and ears, complete the costume.</p>

<p>The conquerors of Parthia continued to be a nation of cavalry; to walk
on foot was a shame for a free man; the national weapon was the bow, and
their way of fighting was to make a series of attacks, separated by a simulated
flight, in which the rider discharged his shafts backwards. Many habits
of the life they had led in the desert were retained, and the Parthian
rulers never lost connection with the nomad tribes on their frontiers, among
whom several Arsacids found temporary refuge. Gradually, of course, the
rulers were assimilated to their subjects; the habitual faithlessness and other
qualities ascribed to the Parthians by the Romans are such as are common
to all Iranians. The origin of the Parthian power naturally produced a rigid
aristocratic system: a few freemen governed a vast population of bondsmen;
manumission was forbidden, or rather was impossible, since social condition
was fixed by descent; the ten thousand horsemen who followed Surenas into
battle were all his serfs or slaves, and of the fifty thousand cavalry who
fought against Antony only four hundred were freemen.</p>

<h4>BACTRIA AND PARTHIA CONSOLIDATE</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[238-206 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Arsaces Tiridates soon added Hyrcania to his realm and raised a great host
to maintain himself against Seleucus, but still more against a nearer enemy,
Diodotus of Bactria. On the death of the latter, the common interests of
Parthians and Bactrians as against the Seleucids brought about an alliance
between Arsaces Tiridates and Diodotus II. With much ado, Seleucus had
got the better of his foreign and intestine foes and kept his kingdom together;
and in 238 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, or a little later, having made peace with Egypt
and silenced his brother, he marched from Babylon into the upper satrapies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Tiridates at first retired and took shelter with the nomadic Apasiacæ, but
he advanced again and gained a victory, which the Parthians continued
to commemorate as the birthday of their independence. Seleucus was unable
to avenge his defeat, being presently called back by the rebellion
stirred up by his aunt Stratonice at Antioch. This gave the great Hellenic
kingdom in Bactria and the small native state in Parthia time to consolidate
themselves. Tiridates used the respite to
strengthen his army, to fortify town and
castles, and to found the city of Dara or
Dareium in the smiling landscape of Abévard.
Tiridates, who on his coins appears
first merely as Arsaces, then as King Arsaces,
and finally as “great king,” reigned
thirty-seven years, dying in 211 or 210 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
His nation ever held his memory in almost
divine honour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p056.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Parthian King</span></p>
</div>

<p>Seleucus III Soter (226-223 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) died
early, and was followed by Antiochus (III)
Magnus (223-137 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), who in his brother’s
life-time had ruled from Babylon over the
upper satrapies. Molon, governor of Media,
supported by his brother Alexander in Persis,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
rose against him in 222 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> and assumed
the diadem. The great resources of
his province, which followed him devotedly,
enabled Molon to take the offensive and
even to occupy Seleucia, after a decisive
battle with the royal general Xenœtas.
Babylonia, the Erythræan district, all Susiana
except the fortress of Susa, Parapotamia
as far as Europus, and Mesopotamia
as far as Dura were successively reduced.
But the young king soon turned the fortunes
of the war. Crossing the Tigris in
person, he cut off Molon’s retreat. Molon
was forced to accept battle near Apollonia:
his left wing passed over to the enemy, and,
after a crushing defeat, he and all his kinsmen and chief followers died by
their own hands (220 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). Antiochus now marched to Seleucia to regulate
the affairs of the East. He used his victory with moderation, mitigating the
severities of his minister Hermias; but he had effectually prevented the rise
of a new kingdom in the most important province of Iran.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[206-155 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>In 209 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, with one hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse,
he marched against the new Parthian king, Arsaces II, son and successor of
Tiridates. The war ended in a treaty which left Arsaces his kingdom, but
beyond question reduced him to a vassal. In 208 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> began the much more
serious war with Bactria. At length, in 206 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, a peace was arranged, and
Antiochus was visited in his camp by Demetrius, the youthful son of Euthydemus,
who pleased the king so well that he betrothed to him his daughter;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Euthydemus was left on his throne, and the two powers swore an alliance
offensive and defensive, which cost Bactria no more than certain payments
of money, the victualling of the Macedonian troops, and the surrender of the
war-elephants. The Bactrian Greeks were grateful for this moderation; their
memorial coins place Antiochus Nicator with Euthydemus Theos, Diodotus
Soter, and Alexander Philippi among the founders of their political existence.</p>

<p>The kings of Parthia had long remained quiet after the war with Antiochus
the Great. Priapatius, successor of Arsaces II (191-176 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), calls
himself on his coins “Arsaces Philadelphus,” perhaps because he had married
a sister, and was the first of all Parthian kings to call himself “Philhellen.”
By the last title he presents himself, at a time when the Seleucid power was
sinking, as the protector of his present and future Greek subjects. His eldest
son and successor, Phraates I (Arsaces Theopater of the coins), conquered
the brave Mardian highlanders and transplanted them to Charax in the
neighbourhood of the Caspian Gates, a proof that the Parthians had already
detached Comisene and Choarene from Media, probably just after the death of
Antiochus the Great.</p>

<h4>CONQUESTS OF MITHRIDATES</h4>

<p>About 171 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Phraates died and left the crown not to his sons but to his
brother Mithridates, a prince of remarkable capacity, who made Parthia the
ruling power in Iran. His first conquests, it would seem, were made at
the expense of Bactria.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Bactria had made vast advances under Euthydemus,
whose son Demetrius crossed the Indian Caucasus and began the Indian
conquests, which soon carried the Greeks far beyond the farthest point of
Alexander. The object, it is plain, was to reach the sea and get a share in
the trade of the world; and it is possible that the extension of the power
of the Bactrian Greeks over Chinese Tatary as far as the Seres and Phaunians
had a similar object&mdash;to protect the trade-route with China. For the
Seres are the Chinese, and the Phauni, according to Pliny, lay west of the
Attacori (the mythical people at the sources of the Hwangho). They occupied,
therefore, the very region which, according to Chinese sources, was
then held by a nomadic pastoral people, the Tibetan No-kiang. Demetrius,
having succeeded his father, was displaced in Bactria by the able usurper
Eucratides, sometime between 181 and 171 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> A thousand cities obeyed
Eucratides, and both he and his rival Demetrius sought to extend the Greek
settlements. Now Justin tells us that the Bactrians were so exhausted by
wars that they at length fell an easy prey to the weaker Parthians; but
Eucratides he describes as a valiant prince, who once with three hundred
men held out during five months, though besieged by sixty thousand men of
Demetrius, king of India; and then, receiving succours, subdued India.</p>

<p>This implies that besides the kingdom of Bactria and that of Demetrius
(the latter now confined to India and probably to the lands east of the Indus)
there were independent states in various districts still Seleucid in 206 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
Justin’s statement is confirmed by the coins, which also show that Eucratides
came forth as victor from a series of wars with the lesser states. Sogdiana,
according to Chinese authorities, was occupied by the Scythians in the life-time
of Eucratides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[155-138 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>On his way back from India Eucratides was murdered by his son and co-regent,
probably Heliocles [<i>ca.</i> 155 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]. The date of this murder may be
fixed by that of Demetrius, who must have been born not later than 224 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and may be taken to have lost his kingdom not later than 159 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Eucratides
cannot, according to Justin’s account, have lived many years longer.</p>

<p>In the midst of the civil wars, which became more serious after the
death of Eucratides, Mithridates of Parthia began to extend his dominions at
the expense of Bactria: even in the life-time of Eucratides he succeeded
in annexing two satrapies. Another account makes Mithridates rule as far
as India, and declares him to have obtained without war the old kingdom of
Porus, or the rule over all nations between the Indus and the Hydaspes. The
two accounts are reconciled by Chinese records, which tell that, about 161 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
the nomad people Sse broke into the valley of the Cophen and founded a kingdom
in the very place of the Parthian conquests in India, which must therefore
have been ephemeral. This fact has its importance, as illustrating the
way in which the internal wars of the east Iranian Greeks helped to prepare
the ground for the Scythian invasion. After this success in the east Mithridates
turned his attention to the west, where the chances of success were not
less inviting. Demetrius had at length fallen before a coalition of the neighbouring
sovereigns, powerfully supported by the Romans through their
instrument, the exile Heraclides. A pretender, Alexander, in 145 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, was
utterly defeated by Ptolemy, and slain in his flight by an Arab chieftain.
Demetrius (II) Nicator, however, soon made himself bitterly hated, and five
years of fighting drove him out of the greater part of Syria.</p>

<h4>MEDIA AND BABYLONIA CONQUERED</h4>

<p>Such was the state of the empire when war broke out between Media
and Parthia, which was finally decided in favour of the latter. The short-lived
independence of Media was soon cut short by Mithridates, who did not
lose the opportunity afforded by the civil wars of Syria in 147 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Babylonia
followed the fate of Media; and the whole province, with its capital
Seleucia, fell into the hands of the Parthians. Thus the East was finally
lost to the Macedonians.</p>

<p>The change of rule was not well received by the new subjects of Parthia,
least of all by the Greeks and Macedonians of the upper provinces,
who sent embassy after embassy to Demetrius. In 140 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> he marched into
Mesopotamia, and thence by Babylon to the upper provinces. He was well
received by the natives, and even the small native states made common cause
with him against the proud barbarians, whose neighbourhood they felt to be
oppressive. He was joined by the Persians and Elymæans, and the Bactrians
helped him by a diversion, appearing now for the first time as an
independent people. At first things went well, and the Parthians were
defeated in several battles, but in Media in 139 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Demetrius was surprised
by the lieutenant of Mithridates during negotiations for peace; his forces
were annihilated, and he himself was taken prisoner and dragged in chains
through the provinces that had joined his cause. The Parthian king
received his captive with favour and assigned him a residence and suitable
establishment in Hyrcania. He even gave him his daughter Rhodogune,
and promised to restore him to his kingdom, but this plan was interrupted
by death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[138 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Mithridates’ latest campaign was against the king of Elymais; the rich
temples yielding him a booty of ten thousand talents (£2,258,000 or
$11,290,000). The country was brought under Parthia, but continued to
have its own kings. The coins make it likely that Mithridates simply set up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
a new dynasty, a branch of his own house. Mithridates died at a good old
age in 138 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, or a little later. His memory was reverenced almost equally
with that of the founder of his house, but his real glory was much greater,
for it was he who made Parthia a great power. He is praised as a just
and humane ruler, who, having become lord of all the lands from the Indian
Caucasus to the Euphrates, introduced among the Parthians the best institutions
of each country, and so became the legislator of his nation.</p>

<h4>PARTHIAN “KINGDOMS”</h4>

<p>The divisions of the empire which he founded can be sketched by the
aid of an excerpt from the itinerary of Isidore of Charax (at the beginning
of the Christian era) and from Pliny. The empire was divided into the
upper and lower kingdoms, separated by the Caspian Gates. The lower
kingdoms were seven: (1) Mesopotamia and Babylonia, (2) Apolloniatis,
(3) Chalonitis, (4) Carina, (5) Cambadene, (6) Upper Media, (7) Lower
or Rhagian Media. The upper kingdoms were eleven: (8) Choarene,
(9) Comisene, (10) Hyrcania, (11) Astauene, (12) Parthyene, (13) Apauarcticene,
(14) Margiana, a part of Bactria, (15) Aria, (16) the country
of the Anauans, (17) Zarangiana, and (18) Arachosia, now called “White
India.” The eighteen Parthian kingdoms thus correspond to six old satrapies.
The Parthians gave much less attention to the west than did their
predecessors, and they still left Mesopotamia as the only great satrapy. We
note also that they cared little for reaching the sea, which they can have
touched only for a little way at the mouth of the Euphrates; and even
here they allowed the petty Characene quite to outstrip them in competing
for the great sea trade.</p>

<p>As compared with the older Macedonian Empire, the Parthian realm
lacked the east Iranian satrapies, Bactria with Sogdiana, and the Paropanisadæ,
and also the three Indian ones, which, with Parætacene, or as it was
afterwards called Sacastane, remained under the Bactrian Greeks and their
successors. In the north they lacked Lesser Media, which had long been an
independent state, and in the south they lacked Susiana, which now belonged
to Elymais, and the satrapies of Persis and Carmania, which the Persians
held along with the western part of Gedrosia. In the extreme west they
lacked Arebelitis proper, which formed a small kingdom under the name of
Adiabene, first mentioned in 69 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> The kingdom of Mannus of Orrha in
northern Mesopotamia, which according to Isidore reached a good way south
of Edessa, seems also to have been independent, and, like Adiabene, probably
existed before the Parthian time.</p>

<p>From these small kingdoms the Parthians asked only an acknowledgment
of vassalship. When Parthia was vigorous the vassalship was real, but
when Parthia was torn by factions it became a mere name. The relation
was always loose, and the political power of Parthia was therefore never
comparable to the later power of the Sassanians. Arsaces Tiridates and his
successors called themselves “great king.” Mithridates, as overlord of the
minor kingships, first bore the title “great king of kings.” The title seems
to have been conferred, not assumed in mere boastfulness.</p>

<p>The nobility had great influence in all things, and especially in the
nomination of the king, who, however, was always an Arsacid. Next to
the king stood the senate of <i>probuli</i>, from whom all generals and lieutenant-governors
were chosen. They were called the king’s kin, and were no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the old Parnian martial nobility. A second senate was composed of the
magians and wise men, and by these two senates the king was nominated.
The Parthians were, in fact, very pious, conscientious in observing even the
most troublesome precepts in Zoroastrianism as to the disposal of dead
bodies, which were exposed to birds of prey and dogs, the bare bones alone
being buried. When the Parthian prince Tiridates visited Nero he journeyed
overland that he might not be forced to defile the sea when he spat,
and his spiritual advisers the magians travelled with him. The magians
were not, indeed, so all-powerful as under the Sassanians, but it is quite a
mistake to think that the Parthians were but lukewarm Zoroastrians.</p>

<h4>SCYTHIAN CONQUEST OF BACTRIA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[177-130 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>The complete annihilation of the Macedonian Empire in Iran was closely
followed by the destruction of Greek independence in eastern Iran. The
last mention of independent Bactria is in 140 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>; no king of Bactria and
Sogdiana is known from coins after the parricide Heliocles. Classical writers
give only two laconic accounts of the catastrophe. Strabo says that the
nomadic peoples of the Asii, Pasiani, Tochari, and Sacaraucæ, dwellers in
the land of the Sacæ, beyond the Jaxartes, opposite to the Sacæ and Sogdians,
came and took Bactria from the Greeks. Trogus names the Scythian
peoples Saraucæ and Asiani. Fortunately the lively interest taken by the
Chinese in the movements of the nomads of central Asia enables us to fill up
this meagre notice from the report of the Chinese agent in Bactria in 128 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
as recorded a little later by the oldest Chinese historian, and from other notices
collected by the Chinese after the opening of the regular caravan route with
the West, about 115 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, and embodied in their second oldest history.</p>

<p>According to these sources the Yue-chi, a nomad people akin to the
Tibetans, lived aforetime between Tun-hoang (Sha-cheu) and the Kilien-shan
Mountains, and about 177 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> were subjugated, like all their neighbours, by
the Turkish Hiung-nu. Between 167 and 161 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> they renewed the struggle
without success; Lao-shang, the great khan of the Hiung-nu, slew their king
Chang-lun, and made a drinking-cup of his skull, and the great mass of the
vanquished people (the great Yue-chi) left their homes and moved westward,
and occupied the land on Lake Issyk-kul, driving before them another
nomad race, the Sse. The Sse took the road by Utch and Kashgar, ultimately
reaching and subduing the kingdom of Kipin (the Kabul valley),
while their old seats were occupied by the great Yue-chi, till they in turn
were soon attacked by the Usun, who lived west of the Hiung-nu, and forced
to move further west (160 or 159 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). In 159 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> they moved straight on
Sogdiana, reaching that land just at the time when internal wars were
undermining the might of Eucratides. The conquest, however, may have
been gradual, since Bactria is still named as independent in 140 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[130-128 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Phraates II, who succeeded his father in 138 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> and continued his work,
wresting Margiana from the Scythians of Bactria in an expedition commemorated
on extant coins, had also to meet the last and most formidable
attempt to restore the sovereignty of the Seleucids. Antiochus VII, one of
the ablest kings of his race, marched eastward at the head of a force of
eighty thousand combatants, swollen by camp-followers to a total of three
hundred thousand. Many of the small princes, on whom the hand of
Parthia lay heavy, joined him as they had joined his brother; the enemy
was smitten on the great Zab, and in two other battles; Babylon and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Ecbatana opened their gates to the conqueror; and the subject nations rose
against the Parthians, who, when Antiochus took up his winter quarters in
Media, were again confined to their ancient limits. When the snows began
to melt, an embassy from Phraates appeared to ask for peace; but the terms
demanded by Antiochus (the liberation of Demetrius, the surrender of all
conquests, and the payment of tribute for the old Parthian country) were
such as could not be accepted without another appeal to the fortunes of war.
Antiochus was met by the Parthian with a superior force of 120,000 men;
he refused the advice of his officers to fall back to the neighbouring mountains,
and accepted battle on a field too narrow for the evolution of his
troops. The Syriac soldiers, enervated by luxury,
were readier to imitate the flight of Athenæus than
the valour of his master; the whole host was involved
in the rout and annihilated. Antiochus
himself escaped wounded from the fray, and cast
himself from a rock that he might not be taken
alive. This catastrophe (February, 129 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>) freed
the Parthians forever from danger from Syria.</p>

<h4>THE SCYTHIANS RAVAGE PARTHIA</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p061.jpg" width="150" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Scythian Warrior</span></p>
</div>

<p>Phraates paid funeral honours to the fallen
king, and afterwards sent his body to Syria in a
silver coffin. He entertained his captive family
royally, married one of the two daughters, and
sent the eldest son, Seleucus, to Syria to claim
the sovereignty, and to serve future plans of his
own; for an attempt to follow and recapture Demetrius,
made immediately after the battle, had
proved too late. But dangers in the east soon
turned the Parthian’s attention away from enterprises
in the west. In his distress he had bribed
the Scythians to send him help; as they arrived
too late he refused to pay them, and they in turn
began to ravage the Parthian country. Phraates
marched against them, leaving his charge at home
to his favourite, the Hyrcanian Euhemerus, who
chastised the countries that had sided with Antiochus,
made war with Mesene, and treated Babylon
and Seleucia with the utmost cruelty. But the Scythian war proved a disastrous
one; the enemy overran the whole empire, and for the first time for five
hundred years Scythian plunderers again appeared in Mesopotamia; in a
decisive battle Phraates was deserted by the old soldiers of Antiochus, whom
he had forced into his service and then treated with insolent cruelty; the
Parthian host sustained a ruinous defeat, and the king himself was slain in
the spring of 128 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, or somewhat later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[128-64 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Artabanus I (third son of Priapatius), who now became king, was an
elderly man. The Scythians, according to the too favourable account by our
chief authority, were content with their victory, and moved homewards,
ravaging the country. But we know from John of Antioch that the successor
of Phraates paid them tribute; and the southern part of Drangiana
must now have been permanently occupied by the Scythian tribes. Finally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the coins reveal the existence of Arsacids who were rival kings to Artabanus
I and Mithridates II, and perhaps borrow from individual successes against
the Scythians the proud titles which so strongly contrast with the really
wretched condition of the empire. Meanwhile it would appear that the men
from Seleucia, driven to desperation, had seized the tyrant Euhemerus and
put him to a cruel death. Artabanus, when they sought his pardon, threatened
to put out the eyes of every man of Seleucia, and was prevented only
by his death, in battle with the Tochari, after a very short reign.</p>

<p>Mithridates II, the Great, his son and successor, was the restorer of the
empire. We are briefly told that he valiantly waged many wars with his
neighbours, added many nations to the empire, and had several successes
against the Scythians, so avenging the disgrace of his predecessors. His
successes, however, must have been practically limited to the recovery of lost
ground, and the eastern frontier was not advanced. It has been common to
connect with his successes the appearance of Parthian names among the Indo-Scythian
princes of the Kabul valley; but this must be false. On the other
hand, Mithridates, if not the first to conquer Mesopotamia, was the first to
fix the Euphrates as the western boundary of the empire, and towards the
end of his reign he was strong enough to interfere with the concerns of Great
Armenia and place Tigranes II on the throne in a time of disputed succession
(94 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), accepting in return the cession of seventy Armenian valleys.</p>

<h4>FIRST CONFLICT WITH ROME</h4>

<p>Now, too, the Parthians, as lords of Mesopotamia, came for the first time
into contact with Rome, and in 92 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, when Sulla came to Cappadocia as proprætor
of Cilicia, he met on the Euphrates the ambassador of Mithridates
seeking the Roman alliance. This embassy was no doubt connected with
the Parthian schemes against Syria. Demetrius III, the Seleucid, who
reigned at Damascus, was compelled to surrender with his whole army and
ended his life as a captive at the Parthian court. Mithridates the Great
seems to have died just after this event; there is no reason to suppose that
he lived to see the disasters which followed so close on his great successes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[64-53 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Artabanus II was the next monarch, but after him the title of king of
kings was taken by the Armenian Tigranes, one of the most dangerous foes
Parthia ever had. In 86 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> it was still a reason for choosing Tigranes, as
king of part of Syria, that he was in alliance with Parthia; but very soon the
latter state was so ruined by civil and foreign war, that it was no match for
Armenia. In 77 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> the Arsacid Sinatruces took the throne. Tigranes
conquered Media, ravaged the country of Arbela and Nineveh, and compelled
the cession of Adiabene and Mesopotamia. Phraates III succeeded his
father, Sinatruces, after a period of hesitating neutrality, accepted the overtures
of Pompey, and prepared to invade Armenia (66 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>), guided by the
younger Tigranes, who had quarrelled with his father and taken refuge in
Parthia, where he wedded the daughter of the king. Tigranes the elder
fled to the mountains; and Phraates turned homeward, leaving young
Tigranes with part of the army to continue the war. The latter, who alone
was no match for his father, fled after an utter defeat to Pompey, who was
just preparing to invade Armenia, and to whom the elder Tigranes presently
surrendered at discretion. The Roman, however, gave him very good terms,
altogether abandoned his son’s cause, and even put him in chains. Meantime
Phraates had occupied the Parthian conquests of Tigranes, which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Romans had promised him, and sent an embassy to Pompey to intercede for
his son-in-law. But the Romans had no further occasion for Parthian help;
and, instead of granting his request, sent Afranius to clear the country and
restore it to Tigranes. Immediately afterwards Pompey’s officer marched
into Syria through Mesopotamia, which by treaty had been expressly recognised
as Parthian; and it was another grievous insult that Pompey in writing
to Phraates had withheld from him the title of king of kings. About
57 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Phraates, the restorer of the empire, was murdered by his two sons,
one of whom, Orodes or Hyrodes I, took the throne, while his brother
Mithridates III got Media; but the latter ruled so cruelly that he was
expelled by the Parthian nobles, and Orodes reigned alone.</p>

<h4>ORODES DEFEATS THE ROMANS</h4>

<p>A Parthian embassy appeared in Syria in the spring to remonstrate against
the faithlessness of Rome, but at the same time the Parthians were ready
for war. Surenas, with Silaces, satrap of Mesopotamia, was pressing the
Roman garrisons, and prepared to confront Crassus with an army wholly
composed of cavalry, while Orodes in person invaded Armenia. In the
spring of 53 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, Crassus and his son Publius crossed the Euphrates at
Zeugma with seven legions and eight thousand cavalry and light troops, making
up a total of forty-two or forty-three thousand men, and was persuaded
by Abgar of Orrhoene to leave the river and march straight across the
plains to Surenas. Surenas kept the mass of his troops concealed by a
wooded hill, showing only the not very numerous vanguard of cataphracts
till the Romans were committed to do battle. The Roman cavalry charged
the enemy to prevent a threatening flank movement, and were drawn away
from the mass of the army by the favourite Parthian manœuvre of a simulated
flight.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_1c1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_1c">c</a></span></p>

<p>So vivid a picture of the ferocity of this battle is given in Plutarch’s
<i>Life of Crassus</i>, that we may well quote it here.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h4>PLUTARCH’S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF CARRHÆ</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[53 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>The enemies seemed not to the Romans at the first to be so great a number,
neither so bravely armed as they thought they had been. For, concerning
their great number, Surenas had of purpose hid them, with certain troops
he sent before; and to hide their bright armours he had cast cloaks and
beasts’ skins upon them, but when both the armies approached near the one
to the other, and that the sign to give charge was lift up in the air: first
they filled the field with a dreadful noise to hear. For the Parthians do not
encourage their men to fight with the sound of a horn, neither with trumpets
nor hautboys, but with great kettle-drums hollow within, and about them
they hang little bells and copper rings, and with them they all make a noise
everywhere together, and it is like a dead sound, mingled as it were with
the braying or bellowing of a wild beast, and a fearful noise as if it thundered,
knowing that hearing is one of the senses that soonest moves the heart
and spirit of any man, and makes him soonest beside himself.</p>

<p>The Romans being put in fear with this dead sound, the Parthians
straight threw the clothes and coverings from them that hid their armour,
and then showed their bright helmets and cuirasses of Margian tempered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
steel, that glared like fire, and their horses barbed with steel and copper.
The bowmen drew a great strength, and had big strong bows, which sent
the arrows from them with a wonderful force. The Romans by means of
these bows were in hard state. For if they kept their ranks, they were
grievously wounded: again if they left them, and sought to run upon the
Parthians to fight at hand with them, they saw they could do them but little
hurt, and yet were very likely to take the greater harm themselves. For,
as fast as the Romans came upon them, so fast did the Parthians fly from
them, and yet in flying continued still their shooting: which no nation but
the Scythians could better do than they, being a matter indeed most greatly
to their advantage. For by their flight they best did save themselves, and
fighting still they thereby shunned the shame that their flying would have
brought down upon them.</p>

<p>The Romans still defended themselves, and held it out, so long as they
had any hope that the Parthians would leave fighting, when they had spent
their arrows or would join battle with them. But after they understood
that there were a great number of camels laden with quivers full of arrows,
where the first that had bestowed their arrows fetched about to take new
quivers: then Crassus, seeing no end of their shot, began to faint, and sent
to Publius his son, willing him in any case to charge with desperate power
upon the enemies, and to give an onset, before they were compassed in on
every side.</p>

<p>But they, seeing him coming, turned straight their horse and fled.
Publius Crassus seeing them fly, cried out, “These men will not abide us,”
and so spurred on for life after them. They thought all had been won, and
that there was no more to do, but to follow the chase: till they were gone
far from the army, and then they found the deceit. For the horsemen that
fled before them suddenly turned again, and a number of others besides came
and set upon them. Whereupon the Romans halted, thinking that the
enemies, perceiving they were so few, would come and fight with them
hand to hand. Howbeit they set out against them their men at arms with
their barbed horse, and made their light horsemen wheel round about them,
keeping no order at all: who galloping up and down the plain, whirled up
the sand hills from the bottom with their horses’ feet, which raised such a
wonderful cloud of dust, that the Romans could scarce see or speak one to
another.</p>

<p>For they, being shut up into a little room, and standing close one to
another, were sore wounded with the Parthians’ arrows, and died of a cruel
lingering death, crying out for anguish and pain they felt: and turning and
tormenting themselves upon the sand, they brake the arrows sticking in
them. Again, striving by force to pluck out the forked arrow heads, that
had pierced far into their bodies through their veins and sinews: thereby
they opened their wounds wider, and so cast themselves away. Many of
them died thus miserably martyred: and such as died not, were not able to
defend themselves.</p>

<p>Then when Publius Crassus prayed and besought them to charge the
men at arms with their barbed horse, they showed him their hands fast nailed
to their targets with arrows, and their feet likewise shot through and nailed
to the ground: so as they could neither fly nor yet defend themselves.
Thereupon himself encouraging his horsemen, went and gave a charge, and
did valiantly set upon the enemies, but it was with too great disadvantage,
both for offence and also for defence. For himself and his men with weak
and light staves brake upon them that were armed with cuirasses of steel, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
stiff leathern jackets. And the Parthians in contrary manner with mighty
strong pikes gave charge upon these Gauls, which were either unarmed or
else but lightly armed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p065.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Parthian Peasant</span></p>
</div>

<p>Yet those were they in whom Crassus most trusted, having done wonderful
feats of war with them. For they received the Parthians’ pikes in
their hands, and took them about their middles, and threw them off their
horse, where they lay on the ground, and could not stir for the weight of
their harness: and there were divers of them also that, lighting from their
horse, lay under their enemies’ horses’ bellies, and thrust their swords into
them. Their horse flinging and bounding in the air for very pain threw
their masters under feet, and the enemies one upon
another, and in the end fell dead among them.
Moreover, extreme heat and thirst did marvellously
cumber the Gauls, who were used to abide neither:
and the most part of their horse were slain, charging
with all their power upon the men at arms of
the Parthians, and so ran themselves in upon the
points of their pikes.</p>

<p>At length, they were driven to retire towards
their footmen, and Publius Crassus among them,
who was very ill by reason of the wounds he had
received. And seeing a sand hill by chance not
far from them, they went thither, and setting their
horse in the midst of it, compassed it round with
their targets, thinking by this means to cover and
defend themselves the better from the barbarous
people: howbeit they found it contrary. For they
that were behind, standing higher, could by no
means save themselves, but were all hurt alike, as
well the one as the other, bewailing their own misery
and misfortune, that must needs die without revenge
or declaration of their valiancy. There were two
Grecians who counselled P. Crassus to steal away
with them. But Publius answered them, that there
was no death so cruel as could make him forsake
them that died for his sake. When he had so said,
wishing them to save themselves, he embraced them,
and took his leave of them: and being very sore
hurt with the shot of an arrow through one of his
hands, commanded one of his gentlemen to thrust
him through with a sword, and so turned his side to
him for the purpose. It is reported Censorinus did the like. But Megabacchus
slew himself with his own hands, and so did the most part of the
gentlemen that were of that company.</p>

<p>And for those that were left alive, the Parthians got up the sand hill,
and fighting with them, thrust them through with their spears and pikes,
and took but five hundred prisoners. After that, they struck off Publius
Crassus’ head, and thereupon returned straight to set upon his father Crassus,
who was then in this state. Crassus the father, after he had willed his son
to charge the enemies, retired the best he could by a hill’s side, looking ever
that his son would not be long before he returned from the chase. But
Publius seeing himself in danger, had sent divers messengers to his father,
to advertise him of his distress, whom the Parthians intercepted and slew by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the way: and the last messengers he sent, escaping very hardly, brought
Crassus news that his son was but cast away, if he did not presently aid him,
and that with a great power. These news were grievous to Crassus in two
respects: first for the fear he had, seeing himself in danger to lose all; and
secondly for the vehement desire he had to go to his son’s help. Thus he
saw in reason all would come to nought, and in fine determined to go with
all his power to the rescue of his son.</p>

<p>But in the meantime the enemies were returned from his son’s overthrow,
with a more dreadful noise and cry of victory than ever before: and thereupon
their deadly sounding drums filled the air with their wonderful noise.
The Romans then looked straight for a hot alarm. But the Parthians that
brought Publius Crassus’ head upon the point of a lance, coming near to the
Romans, showed them his head, and asked them in derision if they knew
what house he was of, and who were his parents: for it was not likely (said
they) that so noble and valiant a young man should be the son of so cowardly
a father as Crassus.</p>

<p>The sight of Publius Crassus’ head killed the Romans’ hearts more than
any other danger they had been in at any time in all the battle. For it
did not set their hearts on fire as it should have done with anger and desire
of revenge: but far otherwise, made them quake for fear, and struck them
stark dead to behold it. Yet Crassus’ self showed greater courage in this
misfortune than he before had done in all the war beside. For riding by
every band he cried out aloud: “Our ancestors in old time lost a thousand
ships, yea in Italy divers armies and chieftains for the conquest of Sicilia:
yet for all the loss of them, at the length they were victorious over them by
whom they were before vanquished. For the empire of Rome came not to
that greatness it now is at by good fortune only, but by patience and constant
suffering of trouble and adversity, never yielding or giving place unto
any danger.”</p>

<p>Crassus, using these persuasions to encourage his soldiers for resolution,
found that all his words wrought none effect: but contrarily, after he had
commanded them to give the shout of battle, he plainly saw their hearts
were done, for their shout rose but faint, and not all alike. The Parthians
on the other side, their shout was great, and lustily they rang it out. Now
when they came to join, the Parthians’ archers on horseback compassing in
the Romans upon the wings shot an infinite number of arrows at their
sides. But their men at arms, giving charge upon the front of the Romans,
battled with their great lances, compelled them to draw into a narrow room,
a few excepted, that valiantly and in desperate manner ran in among them,
as men rather desiring so to die than to be slain with their arrows, where
they could do the Parthians almost no hurt at all. So were they soon
despatched, with the great lances that ran them through, head, wood, and
all, with such a force that oftentimes they ran through two at once.</p>

<p>Thus when they had fought the whole day, night drew on, and made
them retire, saying they would give Crassus that night’s respite, to lament
and bewail his son’s death. So the Parthians, camping hard by the Romans,
were in very good hope to overthrow him the next morning. The Romans
on the other side had a marvellous ill night, making no reckoning to bury
their dead, nor to dress their wounded men, that died in miserable pain;
but every man bewailed his hard fortune, when they saw not one of them
could escape, if they tarried till the morning. But Crassus went aside without
light, and laid him down with his head covered, because he would see
no man, showing thereby the common sort an example of unstable fortune;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
and the wise men, a good learning to know the fruits of ill counsel and vain
ambition, that had so much blinded him that he could not be content to
command so many thousands of men, but thought (as a man would say)
himself the meanest of all, and one that possessed nothing, because he was
accounted inferior unto two persons only, Pompey and Cæsar.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Octavius, one of his chieftains, and Cassius the
treasurer, seeing him so overcome with sorrow and out of heart that he
had no life nor spirit in him, they themselves called the captains and centurions
together, and sat in council for their departure, and so agreed that
there was no longer tarrying for them. Thus of their own authority at
the first they made the army march away without any sound of trumpet
or other noise.</p>

<p>But immediately after, they that were left hurt and sick, and could not
follow, seeing the camp remove, fell a-crying out and tormenting themselves
in such sort that they filled the whole camp with sorrow, and put them out
of all order with the great moan and loud lamentation; so that the foremost
rank that first dislodged fell into a marvellous fear, thinking they had been
the enemies that had come and set upon them. Then turning oft, and setting
themselves in battle array, one while loading their beasts with the wounded
men, another while unloading them again, they were left behind.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_1d"><!-- letter not in references list for this chapter -->d</span></p>

<p>After getting dangerously entangled in marshy ground, Crassus had
almost reached the mountains when he was induced, by the despair of his
troops rather than by error of his own judgment, to yield to treacherous proposals
of Surenas and descend again into the plain. As he mounted the horse
which was to convey him to the meeting with the enemy’s general, the gestures
of the Parthians excited suspicions of treachery, a struggle ensued, and
Crassus was struck down and slain. Scarcely ten thousand out of the whole
host reached Syria by way of Armenia; twenty thousand had fallen and ten
thousand captives were settled in Antioch, the capital of Margiana.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[53-40 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>The token of victory, the hand and head of Crassus, reached Orodes in
Armenia just as he had made peace with Artavasdes and betrothed his eldest
son Pacorus to the daughter of the Armenian king. The Roman disaster
was due primarily to the novelty of the Parthian way of assault, which
took them wholly by surprise, and partly also to bad generalship; but
the Romans always sought a traitor to account for a defeat, and in the
present case they threw the blame partly on Andromachus of Carrhæ, who
really did mislead Crassus in his retreat, and was rewarded by the Parthians
with the tyranny of his native town, but had no great influence on the disaster;
and partly on Abgar, whose advice was no doubt bad, but not necessarily
treacherous.</p>

<p>Surenas, the victor of Carrhæ, whose fame was now too great for the
condition of a mere subject, was put to death a little later, the victim of
Orodes’ jealousy; the victory itself was weakly followed up. Not till 52 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
was Syria invaded, and then with forces so weak that Cassius found the
defence easy.</p>

<p>Orodes avoided a threatened breach with his son Pacorus, by associating
him in the empire; but the Parthians took little advantage of the civil wars
that preceded the fall of the Roman Republic. They occasionally stepped
in to save the weaker party from utter annihilation, but even this policy was
not followed with energy, and Orodes refused to help Pompey in his distress
because the Roman would not promise to give him Syria. Labienus was
with Orodes negotiating for help on a larger scale when the news of Philippi
arrived, and remained with him till 40 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, when he was at last sent back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Syria, together with Pacorus and a numerous host. The Roman garrisons
in Syria were old troops of Brutus and Cassius, who had been taken over by
Antony; those in the region of Apamea joined Labienus; Antony’s legate
Decidius Saxa was defeated, and fled from the camp afraid of his own men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[43-36 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Apamea, Antioch, and all Syria soon fell into the hands of the Parthians,
and Decidius was pursued and slain. Pacorus advanced along the great
road and received the submission of all the Phœnician cities save Tyre.
Simultaneously the satrap Barzaphranes appeared in Galilee; the patriots
all over Palestine rose against Phasael and Herod; and five hundred Parthian
horse appearing before Jerusalem were enough to overthrow the Roman
party and substitute Antigonus for Hyrcanus. The Parthian administration
was a favourable contrast to the rule of the oppressive proconsuls, and the
justice and clemency of Pacorus won the hearts of the Syrians. Meantime
Labienus had penetrated Asia Minor as far as Lydia and Ionia. The Roman
governor Plancus could only hold the islands; most of the cities opened their
gates to Labienus, the “Parthicus imperator.”</p>

<p>But Rome even in its time of civil divisions was stronger than Parthia; in
39 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Ventidius Bassus, general for Antony, suddenly appeared in Asia and
drove Labienus and his provincial levies before him without a battle as far as
the Taurus. Here the Parthians came to Labienus’ help, but, attacking rashly
and without his co-operation, they were defeated by Ventidius and Labienus’
troops were involved in the disaster; Phranipates, the ablest lieutenant of
Pacorus, fell, and the Parthians evacuated Syria. Before Ventidius had
completed the resettlement of the Roman power in Syria and Palestine, and
while his troops were dispersed in winter quarters, the Parthians fell on him
again with a force of more than twenty thousand men and an unusually
large proportion of free cavaliers in full armour. A battle was fought near
the shrine of Hercules at Gindarus in Cyrrhestica, on the anniversary, it is
said, of the defeat of Crassus (9th of June, 38 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>); the Parthians were utterly
routed and Pacorus himself was slain. His head was sent round to the
cities of Syria which were still in revolt, to prove to them that their hopes
had failed. There was no further resistance save from Aradus and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Orodes, now an old man and sorely afflicted by the death of his favourite
son, nominated his next son, Phraates, as his colleague, and the latter began
to reign by making away with brothers of whom he was jealous, and then
strangling his father, who had not concealed his anger at the former crime
(37 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). The reign of Orodes was the culminating point of Parthian
greatness, and all his successors adopted his title of king of kings, “Arsaces
Euergetes.” It was he who moved the capital westward to Seleucia, or
rather to Ctesiphon (Taisefún), its eastern suburb.</p>

<h4>PHRAATES IV REPELS MARK ANTONY</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[36-9 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>Phraates IV continued his reign in a series of crimes, murdering every
prominent man among his brothers, and even his own adult son, that the
nobles might find no Arsacid to lead their discontent. Many of the nobles
fled to foreign parts, and Antony felt encouraged to plan a war of vengeance
against Parthia. Antony had no hope of forcing the well-guarded
Euphrates frontier; but since the death of Pacorus, Armenia had again been
brought under Roman patronage, and he hoped to strike a blow at the
heart of Parthia. Keeping the Parthians in play by feigned proposals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
peace while he matured his preparations, he appeared in Atropatene in 36 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
with sixty thousand legionaries and forty thousand cavalry and auxiliary
troops, and at once formed the siege of the capital Phraaspa. The Median
king Artavasdes, son of Ariobarzanes, had marched to join Phraates, who
looked for the attack in another quarter. Phraates had only forty thousand
Parthians, including but four hundred freemen who never left the king, and
probably ten thousand Median cavalry; but these forces were well handled,
and the two kings had reached the scene of war before Antony was joined
by his baggage and heavy siege-train, and opened the campaign by capturing
the train and cutting to pieces its escort of seventy-five hundred
men under the legate Oppius Statianus. Antony was still able to repel
a demonstration to relieve Phraaspa; but his provisions ran short, and the
foraging parties were so harassed that the siege made no progress. As
it was now October, he was at length forced to open negotiations with
Phraates.</p>

<p>The Parthians promised peace if the Romans withdrew; but when
Antony took him at his word, abandoning the siege-engines, he began a
vigorous pursuit, and kept the Romans constantly on the defensive, chastising
one officer who hazarded an engagement by a defeat which cost the
Romans three thousand killed and five thousand wounded. Still greater
were the losses by famine and thirst and dysentery; and the whole force
was utterly demoralised and had lost a fourth part of its fighting men, a
third of the camp-followers, and all the baggage when, after a retreat of
twenty-seven days from Phraaspa to the Araxes by way of Mianeh (276
miles), they reached the Armenian frontier. Eight thousand more perished
of cold and from snow-storms in the Armenian mountains; the mortality
among the wounded was terrible; the Romans would have been undone had
not Artavasdes of Armenia allowed them to winter in his land.</p>

<p>The failure of the expedition was due partly to the usual Roman ignorance
of the geographical and climatic conditions, partly to a rash haste in
the earlier operations; but very largely also (as in the case of Napoleon’s
Russian campaign) to the lack of discipline in the soldiers of the Civil
War, which called for very severe chastisement even during the siege of
Phraaspa, and culminated at length in frequent desertions and in open
mutiny, driving Antony to think of suicide. The Romans laid the whole
blame on Artavasdes, but without any adequate reason. At the same time,
the disaster of Antony following that of Crassus seemed to show that within
their own country the Parthians could not safely be attacked on any side,
and for a century and a half Roman cupidity left them alone.</p>

<p>Media and Armenia fell before the Parthians; the Romans who were
still in the country were slain, and Artaxes II was raised to the Armenian
throne (30 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). In the very next year, however, the course of the Parthian
affairs led Artaxes to make his peace with Rome. Phraates’ tyranny had
only been aggravated by his successes, and open rebellion broke out in 33 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>
We have coins of an anonymous pretender dated March to June 32 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> To
him succeeded Tiridates II, whose rebellion was at a climax during the war
of Actium. Phraates was taken by surprise and fled, slaying his concubines
that they might not fall a prey to his victor. Tiridates seated himself on
the throne in June, 27 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, and Phraates wandered for some time in exile till
he persuaded the Scythians to undertake his cause. Before the great host
of the Scythians Tiridates retired without a contest. In June, 26 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, as the
coins prove, Phraates again held the throne. In 10 or 9 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Phraates
took the precaution of sending his family to Rome so that the rebels might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
have no Arsacid pretender to put forward, keeping only and designating
as heir his youngest son by his favourite wife Thea Musa Urania, an Italian
slave girl presented to him by Augustus. This was mainly a scheme of
Urania’s, and she and her son crowned it by murdering the old tyrant.</p>

<h4>ANARCHY IN PARTHIA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[9 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-40 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Phraates V, or as he is usually called Phraataces (diminutive), was thus
the third Arsacid in successive generations to reach the throne by parricide.
Phraates V, whose first coin is of 2 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, tried an energetic policy, expelling
Artavasdes III, and the Roman troops that supported him from Armenia,
and seating on the throne Tigranes IV, who had been a fugitive under
Parthian protection. As Augustus did not wish to extend the empire, and
Phraates was not very secure on his throne, neither party cared to fight,
and an agreement was patched up after some angry words, Phraates resigning
all claim on Armenia and leaving his brothers as hostages in Rome (1 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>).
Phraates now married his mother, a match probably meant to conciliate the
clergy, as he knew that the nobles hated him. In fact he was soon driven
by a rebellion (after October, 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) to flee to Roman soil, where he died,
it seems, not long afterwards.</p>

<p>The Parthians called Orodes II from exile to the throne. Of him we
have a coin of autumn, 6 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>; but his wild and cruel temper soon made
him hated, and he was murdered while out hunting. Anarchy and bloodshed
now gaining the upper hand, the Parthians sent to Rome (before
9 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), and received thence as king Vonones, the eldest of the sons of
Phraates IV, a well-meaning prince, whose foreign education put him quite
out of sympathy with his country. A strong reaction of national feeling
took place, and the main line of the Arsacids being now exhausted by death
or exile, Artabanus, an Arsacid on the mother’s side, who had grown up
among the Dahæ and had afterwards been made king of Media (Atropatene),
was set up as pretendant in 10 or 11 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Artabanus was defeated
at first, but ultimately gained a great and bloody victory and seated himself
in Ctesiphon. Vonones fled to Armenia and was chosen as king of
that country (16 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>); but Tiberius, who was anxious to avoid war, and
did not wish to give Artabanus III any pretext to invade Armenia, persuaded
Vonones to retire to Syria. Later he was interned in Cilicia, and in
19 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> lost his life in an attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Amidst such constant rebellions Artabanus III, shrewd and energetic,
not merely held his own but waged successful foreign wars, set his son
Arsaces on the throne of Armenia, and challenged Rome still more directly
by raising claims to lordship over the Iranian population of Cappadocia.
Through the whole first century of the Roman Empire all relations to Parthia
turned on the struggle for influence in Armenia, and, much as he loved
peace, Tiberius could not suffer this disturbance of the balance of power to
pass unnoticed. Much as Artabanus hated the Romans, his insecure position
at home drove him in 37 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> to make an accommodation on terms favourable
to them and send his son Darius as hostage to Tiberius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[40-81 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In Artabanus’ life-time the second place in the empire had been held by
one Gotarzes, who appears to have been his colleague in the upper satrapies,
and perhaps his lieutenant in his flight to Adiabene. But there is monumental
evidence that he was not, as Josephus says and Tacitus implies,
Artabanus’ son (except by adoption), and so we find that the succession first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
fell to Vardanes, who coined money in September, 40 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> But in 41 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>,
Gotarzes gave Vardanes an opportunity to return; in two days he rode 345
miles, and taking his rival by surprise he forced him to flee, and occupied the
lower satrapies, where he coined regularly from July, 42 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, onwards. The
renewal of civil war enabled the emperor Claudius, with the aid of the Iberians,
to drive the Parthian satrap Demonax from Armenia and reseat Mithridates
on the throne. Meantime Gotarzes and Vardanes were face to face in
the plain of western or Parthian Bactria, but an attempt on the life of the
latter having been disclosed by his foe they made peace, and Gotarzes withdrew
to Hyrcania; while Vardanes, confirmed in his empire, returned to
Seleucia and took it in 43 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> after a siege of seven years.</p>

<p>That Vardanes was a great king is plain from the high praise of Tacitus
and the attention which the greatest of Roman historians bestows on a reign
which had no direct relations to Rome. Vardanes, whose last coin is of
August, 45 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, was murdered while hunting&mdash;a victim, we are told, to
the hatred produced by his severity to his subjects. But in judging of the
charges brought against him and his two predecessors, we must remember
that the rise of a new dynasty like that of Artabanus is always accompanied
by deeds of violence, and that the oppressed subjects are simply the utterly
unruly Parthian nobles who had lost all discipline in the long civil wars,
and could only be controlled by force.</p>

<p>Gotarzes died of a sickness, not before June, 51 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, and was followed by
Vonones II, who had been king in Atropatene, and was probably a brother
of Artabanus III. According to the coins his short reign began before September,
51 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, and did not end before October, 54 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> He was succeeded
by his eldest son, Volagases I, the brothers acquiescing in his advancement,
although his mother was only a concubine from Miletus; and receiving their
compensation by being nominated to kingdoms which gave them the second
and third places after the king of kings&mdash;Pacorus to Media or Atropatene, and
Tiridates to Armenia. The Armenians now offered no resistance to the Parthians,
but the Romans were not content to lose their influence in the land.
Open war with Rome, however, was still delayed by negotiations. Finally
Rome refused to confirm a treaty, and war was declared. The first year
of the war (62 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) was unfortunate for the Romans. Next year the war was
resumed, and Corbulo, crossing the Euphrates at Melitene, had penetrated
into Sophene when the Parthians earnestly sought peace. It was agreed
that Tiridates should lay down his diadem and go to Rome in person to
receive it again from the emperor, which was done accordingly in 66 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
The real advantage of the war lay more with Parthia than with Rome; for
if the Roman suzerainty over Armenia was admitted, the Parthians had succeeded,
after a contest which had lasted a generation, in placing an Arsacid
on the Armenian throne. After Nero’s death Volagases (Vologeses) formed
very friendly relations with Vespasian, which endured till 75 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Volagases I died soon after the Alan wars, leaving a just reputation by
his friendly relation to his brothers (a relation so long unknown), his patient
steadfastness in foreign war and home troubles, and his foundation of a new
capital. Perhaps also he has the merit of collecting from fragments or oral
tradition all that remained of the Avesta. From June, 78 <span class="smcapuc">A.D</span>., we find two
kings coining and reigning together, Volagases II and Pacorus II, probably
brothers. From 79 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> there is a long break in the coins of the former, and
Artabanus IV takes his place with a coin struck in July, 81 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> This Artabanus
appears as the protector of a certain Terentius Maximus, who pretended
to be Nero; he threatened to restore him and displace Titus by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
force, and though the pretender was at length given up, the farce, which
was kept up till 88 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, might have ended in earnest but for the disorders
of the times&mdash;indicated by a break in the Parthian coinage between 84 and
93 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, in which latter year Pacorus appears as sole king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[88-116 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At this time the political horizon of Parthia was very wide, and its intercourse
with the farthest East was livelier than at any other date. In 90 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
the Yue-chi had come to war with the governor of Chinese Tatary and been
reduced to vassalship: in 94 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> a Chinese expedition slew their king, and
advancing to the “North Sea” (Lake Aral) subdued fifty kingdoms. The
Tochari, one sees, like the Greeks before them, had neglected the lands
north of the Hindu-Kush in their designs on India; even of Ooemo-Kadphises
no coins are found north of that range. In 97 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Chinese envoys
directed to Rome actually reached the Mediterranean, but were dissuaded
from going further from Parthian accounts of the terrors of the sea voyage;
and in 101 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Muon-kiu, king of An-si (Parthians), sent lions and gazelles
to the emperor of China. Muon-kiu reigned in Ho-to&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Carta or Zadracarta
in Hyrcania; he was therefore a king of the Hyrcanians, who also
held the old Parthian lands east of the Caspian Gate, and may be identical
with a king, rival to Pacorus, who struck copper coins in 107 and 108 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>,
if the latter is not identical with the later monarch Osroes.</p>

<p>But at any rate the representative of the Parthian power in the West
was still Pacorus II, who in 110 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> sold the crown of Edessa to Abgar VII,
bar Izat, and died soon after, making way for his brother Osroes, who had to
reckon with two rivals&mdash;Volagases II from 112 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> onwards, and Meherdates
(Mithridates) VI. The latter was a brother of Osroes, and so probably
was the former. None of the three was strong enough to conquer the
others, and continual war went on between them till Osroes was foolish
enough to provoke Roman intervention by taking Armenia from Exedares,
son of Pacorus, to whose appointment Rome had not objected, and transferring
it to another son of Pacorus called Parthamasiris.</p>

<h4>THE ROMANS INTERVENE</h4>

<p>Trajan, who had quite thrown over the principle of the Julii and Flavii
(that the Danube and the Euphrates were the boundaries of the empire)
and was fully embarked on the old Chauvinist traditions of the republic,
would not let such an occasion slip; and refusing an answer to an embassy
that met him at Athens, he entered Armenia and took Arsamosata without
battle, after receiving the homage of western Armenia (114 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). Parthamasiris
submitted himself to the emperor, but Trajan declared that Armenia
must be a Roman province, appointed an escort to see the Parthian over the
border, and when he resisted and tried to escape ordered his execution&mdash;a
brutal act, meant to inspire terror and show that the Arsacids should no
longer be treated with on equal terms. Armenia and the neighbouring kings
to the north having given in their submission, Trajan marched back to Edessa,
receiving the homage of Abgar. The campaign of 115 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> was in Mesopotamia.
At its close Mesopotamia was made a Roman province; the Cardueni
and the Marcomedi of the Armenian frontier had also been reduced, and
Trajan received the title of “Parthicus.” In 116 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> the Tigris was crossed
in the face of the enemy, and a third new province of Assyria absorbed the
whole kingdom of Mebarsapes. Once more the Tigris was crossed and
Babylonia invaded, still without resistance from the Parthians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[116-166 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A Roman fleet descended the Euphrates and the ships were conveyed
across on rollers to the Tigris, to co-operate with the army; and now Ctesiphon
fell and Osroes fled to Armenia, the northeast parts of which cannot
have been thoroughly subdued. The Roman fleet descended the Tigris and
received the submission of Mesene; but now, while Trajan was engaged in
a voyage of reconnaissance in the Persian Gulf, plainly aiming at Bahrein,
all the new provinces revolted and destroyed or expelled the Roman garrisons.
The rebellion was at length put down, but Trajan now saw what it
would cost to maintain direct Roman rule over such wide and distant conquests,
and Parthamaspates was solemnly crowned in the great plain by
Ctesiphon in the presence of Romans and Parthians (winter of 117 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). An
unsuccessful siege of Atra (Hatrá) in the Mesopotamian desert was Trajan’s
next undertaking; illness and the revolt of the Jews prevented him from
resuming the campaign, and after Trajan’s death (7th of August, 117 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
Hadrian wisely withdrew the garrisons from the new provinces, which
would have demanded the constant presence of the imperial armies, and
again made the Euphrates the limit of the empire. Parthamaspates, too,
had soon to leave Parthia, and Hadrian gave him Orrhoene. Thus Trajan’s
Chauvinist policy had no other result than to show to the world the miserable
weakness to which discord had reduced the Parthians. Osroes died soon
after, and Volagases II became sole monarch, dying in November, 148 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>,
at the age of about ninety-six, after a reign of seventy-one years.</p>

<p>Volagases III, who succeeded, had designs on Armenia, and in 162 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
expelled the Arsacid Sohæmus, who was a client of Rome, and made Pacorus
king. The destruction of a Roman legion under the legate of Cappadocia
(Ælius Severianus), who fell on his own sword, laid Cappadocia and
Syria open to the Parthians. When late in the year Ælius Verus arrived
from the capital he found the troops so demoralised by defeat that he was
ready to offer peace; but when Volagases refused to treat, the able lieutenants
whom Verus directed from Antioch soon changed the face of affairs.</p>

<p>The war had two theatres, and was officially called the Armenian and
Parthian War. Armenia was regained and Sohæmus restored (163, 164
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), while Avidius Cassius drove Volagases from Syria in a bloody
battle at Europus, and entering north Mesopotamia, took Edessa and Nisibis,
though not without serious opposition. At length, deserted by his allies
(the local kings, who were becoming more and more independent), Volagases
abandoned Mesopotamia, and Cassius entered Babylonia, where, on a frivolous
pretext, he gave up to rapine and the flames the friendly city of Seleucia,
still the first city of the East, with four hundred thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>The destruction of Seleucia was a hideous crime, a mortal wound dealt
to Eastern Hellenism by its natural protectors; that Cassius next, advancing
to Ctesiphon, razed the palace of Volagases to the ground may, on the
other hand, be defended as a symbolical act calculated more than anything
else to impair the prestige of the Parthian with his oriental subjects. Cassius
returned to Syria in 165 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, with his victorious army much weakened through
the failure of the commissariat and by the plague, which, breaking out in
Parthia immediately after the fall of Seleucia, spread over the whole known
world. In the same year Martius Verus won hardly less considerable successes
in Media Atropatene, then apparently a separate kingdom. The peace
which followed in 166 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> gave Mesopotamia to Rome.</p>

<p>This was the greatest of all wars between Rome and Parthia, alike in the
extent of the lands involved and the energy of attack shown by the Parthians.
Parthia, after this last effort, continued steadily to decline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<h4>THE DECAY OF PARTHIAN GREATNESS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[166-217 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Romans at the same time made an effort to compete with Parthia for
the Chinese trade (especially in silk), which the latter had jealously kept in
their own hands, and in 166 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> an envoy of An-thun (M. Antoninus) reached
the court of the emperor Huan-ti, <i>via</i> the sea and Tongking. But the effort
to establish a direct trade with China was unavailing, and the trade still
flowed in its old channels when a second Roman agent reached China in
226 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, a little before the fall of the Parthian Empire. The Chinese tell
us that with India also the Parthians drove a considerable trade.</p>

<p>Volagases III died in 191 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, having reigned forty-two years without
civil war, and was succeeded by Volagases IV, who fought several vain battles
with Rome. In 199 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> a fleet on the Euphrates co-operated with the
Roman army, and Severus, taking up an unaccomplished plan of Trajan,
dredged out the old Naarmalca canal, through which his ships sailed into the
Tigris, and took the Parthians wholly by surprise. Seleucia and Coche were
deserted by their inhabitants; Ctesiphon was taken by the end of the year with
terrible slaughter, one hundred thousand inhabitants being led captive and
the place given up to pillage, for the Great King had fled powerless at the
approach of the foe. Severus, whose force was reduced by famine and
dysentery, did not attempt pursuit, but drew off up the Tigris. The army
was again in its quarters by the 1st of April, 200 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, and for some time
thereafter Severus was occupied in Armenia. But in 201 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> he undertook
a carefully organised expedition against Atra, from whose walls the Romans
had been repulsed with great loss when Severus, returning from the Tigris in
the previous year, had attempted to carry it by a <i>coup de main</i>. This city,
which in Trajan’s time was neither great nor rich, was now a wealthy place,
and the sun temple contained vast treasures. The classical authors call it
Arabian, but the king’s name is Syriac&mdash;Barsenius, <i>i.e.</i>, Bar Sín, son of the
moon, and we may suppose that it was really an Aramæan principality, which
like Palmyra had its strength from the surrounding Arab tribes that it
could call into the field. Severus lay before Atra for twenty days, but the
enemy’s cavalry cut off his foraging parties, the admirable archers galled the
Roman troops, a great part of the siege-train was burned with naphtha; and
when, in addition, two assaults had been repulsed with tremendous loss on
two successive days, the emperor was compelled to raise the siege&mdash;a severe
blow to Roman prestige in the East, and one that greatly exalted the name
of Atra and its prince, but did not help in the least the decaying power of
Parthia.</p>

<p>In 209 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Volagases IV was succeeded by his son Volagases V, under
whom in 212 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> the fatal troubles in Persia began; while in 213 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> his
brother Artabanus rose as rival claimant of the kingship, and the civil war
lasted for many years. A fresh danger arose when Tiridates, a brother of
Volagases IV, who had long been a refugee with the Romans and had accomplished
Severus’ campaign of 199 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, escaped, in company with a Cilician
adventurer, the cynic Antiochus, to the court of his nephew Volagases; for
the emperor Antoninus (Caracalla) demanded their surrender, and obtained
it only by a declaration of war (215 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). About the same time Artabanus
gained the upper hand, and in 216 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> he held Ctesiphon and its district;
but Volagases still held out in the Greek cities of Babylonia, as his tetradrachms
prove (till 222 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). Artabanus’ strength lay in the north; the
Arab histories of the Sassanians make him king of the Median region. Presently
Artabanus had a war with Rome on his hands. An overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Parthian force fell on Mesopotamia and refused to be appeased by the restoration
of the captives of the previous year; Macrinus was beaten in two
engagements and compelled to retire to Syria, abandoning the Mesopotamian
plain; and in the winter of 217-218 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> he was glad to purchase peace for
an indemnity of 50,000,000 denarii (£1,774,298 or $8,871,490). In or about
222 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Artabanus must also have displaced his brother in Babylonia.</p>

<h4>PERSIA CONQUERS PARTHIA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[217-228 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Persia, which dealt the last blow to the Arsacids, had through the whole
Parthian period held an isolated position, and is so seldom mentioned that
our knowledge of its history and native princes is almost wholly due to recently
found coins. The emblems on the coins show that Persia was always
loyally Zoroastrian, and at Istakhr stood the famous Fire temple of the
goddess Anahedh. Its priest was Sassan, whose marriage with a Bazrangian
princess, Rambehisht, laid the foundation of the greatness of his house, while
priestly influence, which was very strong, doubtless favoured its rise. Pabak,
son of Sassan, and Ardashir, son of Pabak, begin the history of the Sassanian
dynasty, which occupies the next chapter. Artabanus did nothing to check
the rise of the new power till Ardashir had all Persia in his hands (224 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
and had begun to erect a palace and temple at Gor (Firuzabad). Nirofar,
king of Elymais, was then sent against him, but was defeated, and now Ardashir
passed beyond Persia and successively reduced Ispahan (Farætacene),
Ahwaz (Elymais), and Mesene.</p>

<p>After this victory Ardashir sent a challenge to Artabanus himself; their
armies met by appointment in the plain of Hormizdjan, and Artabanus fell
(the 28th of April, 227 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). Ctesiphon and Babylonia must have fallen
not much later, though Volagases V seems to have re-established himself
there on his brother’s death, and a tetradrachm shows that he held the city
till autumn 227 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> The conquest of Assyria and great part of Media and
Parthia is assigned by Dion expressly or by implication to the year 228 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
And so the Parthian Empire was at an end.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_1c2"><a href="#parthians_endnote_1c">c</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II. THE EMPIRE OF THE SASSANIDS</h3>

<div class="sidenote">[228-652 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Of the countries whose sovereigns were subject to the dominion (sometimes
actual and sometimes merely nominal) of the Parthian “king of kings,”
Persia proper itself was one. The names of some of the lesser kings of that
country during the Arsacid period are known to us, partly through a reference
here and there in literature, partly from their coins; but we do not
know whether they all belong to one and the same dynasty. About the
beginning of the third century after Christ, the country presented a scene
of confusion. The power of the local kings had fallen very low, and the
mountainous regions, cleft asunder by natural divisions, were full of petty
tyrants. Papak or Pabak, a son or descendant of Sassan, was one of these.
He came originally from the village of Khir on the southern shore of the
great salt lake east of Shiraz, and succeeded in overthrowing the last prince
of that dynasty, Gozihr by name, in whose service he had been, and gaining
dominion first over the district of Istakhr, the ancient Persepolis. On coins
and inscriptions his son gives him the title of king. According to tradition,
which in this instance is certainly trustworthy, his lawful successor would
have been his son Sapor, to whom the Arsacid king is said to have granted
the crown at his father’s request during the life-time of the latter.</p>

<p>After his death, however, another of his sons, named Ardashir, refused to
submit to his brother, and rose in revolt; about which time Sapor died&mdash;we
can hardly suppose by accident. That Ardashir found his brothers in his
way and slew them, is so definitely affirmed by well authenticated tradition
that we cannot entertain a doubt that such was the case. The empire of the
Sassanids begins with Ardashir, just as that of the Achæmenides begins
with Cyrus, whose forefathers had likewise been kings. His name, of which
Artachshathr is the older form, is the same as that which the Greeks rendered
by Artaxerxes. It is a remarkable fact that in the native home of the Achæmenides,
who are otherwise unknown to genuine Persian tradition, the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
royal names should have survived in common use; for several princes of the
pre-Sassanid period were named Artaxerxes and Darius (Darjaw, Darao,
Dara). According to a fairly probable estimate, Ardashir’s first appearance
as king should be assigned to the year 211-12 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[211-233 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>That he had hard work to exalt himself from prince of Persis to “king
of the kings of Iran” is recognised by tradition. He first made himself
master of the province of Carmania, which lies east of Persis, then of Susiana,
then of the small kingdom about the mouth of the Tigris. The resistance
which he had to overcome in the first instance was offered by local
sovereigns, not by the Parthian king, whose power was restricted to an
enormous extent by his nobles and vassals. Ultimately, however, Ardashir
came into conflict with him also.</p>

<p>According to Dion Cassius,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_2c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_2c">c</a></span> a contemporary, we are led to believe that
Ardashir defeated the Parthians in three battles. His decisive encounter
with Ardavan (Artabanus), the last Parthian Great King, probably took place
on April 22nd, 224 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Ardavan fell in the battle, and from that time
forward Ardashir assumed the title of “king of kings,” which from ancient
days had been borne by the ruler of the empire of anterior Asia. All the
evidence points to the decisive battle having taken place in Babylonia or
Susiana. This would fit in with Dion’s statement that the first expedition
afterwards undertaken was directed against Atra, in the midst of the Mesopotamian
desert, where a small independent state had come into being in the
near neighbourhood of the Parthian capital. At first Ardashir beat in vain
upon the walls of Atra, whose strength can still be seen from the mighty
ruins that remain, but the place was soon taken and destroyed either by him
or his successor. He succeeded in conquering Media, where he was opposed
by a scion of the Arsacid family, and the greater part of the Iranian highlands;
but not Armenia, whither sons of Ardavan had fled.</p>

<p>The Romans had watched the rise of Ardashir with apprehension. There
is no question that he cherished the design of seizing upon as many of their
Asiatic possessions as he could. He gained some successes at first, but was
forced to give ground when Alexander Severus marched against him. The
history of the empire of the Sassanids was conditioned from the outset by
its relations with Rome. Peace was again and again concluded between the
two, but they invariably looked upon each other as adversaries, and as adversaries
of equal rank. Under capable rulers and tolerable internal conditions
Rome (that is Byzantium) maintained the ascendency of the European over
the Asiatic, but circumstances were frequently adverse, and the Persians
heaped disgrace upon the Roman name. This struggle fills the chief place
in the political history of the Sassanids.</p>

<h4>SASSANIAN POWER</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[236-260 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Istakhr remained the capital in theory, as Persepolis had formerly been.
There stood the Fire temple of the royal house, in which the heads of vanquished
foreign kings were hung up among other trophies. But the real
metropolis was Ctesiphon, the capital of the Arsacids, and Seleucia, which
was divided from it only by the Tigris and which Ardashir restored under
the name of Veh-Ardashir (good Ardashir). The rich country in which
this double city lay was neither geographically nor ethnographically a part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Iran, for the deep valley was peopled principally by Semites; the choice
of it as the seat of government was due to the precedent set by the elder
empire and in part, probably, to its nearness to Roman territory. We cannot
in all cases be sure over which countries Ardashir ruled at the end of
his life, for the national tradition tells of some conquests really made by his
successors, and others which the Sassanids never made at all. But Ardashir
won and consolidated a great empire that held together for four centuries,
giving a powerful blow to the system of vassal states, which had become
more and more prevalent under the Arsacids, and reducing most of these
states to provinces.</p>

<h4>SAPOR FIGHTS ROME</h4>

<p>The statement that he associated his son Sapor with him in the government
gains a degree of confirmation from the existence of coins bearing a
youthful head beside his own. He died at the end of 241 or the beginning
of 242. Sapor I (older form Shahpur; among Occidentals Sapor or
Sapores) was in all likelihood solemnly crowned on March 20th, 242.
The mythical statement that his mother was an Arcadian princess whom
Ardashir took to wife at the conquest of Ctesiphon is incompatible with
the probably more correct tradition that he had distinguished himself in the
decisive battle against Ardavan; nor is it likely that a child of thirteen or
fourteen would have taken so energetically in hand the war against Rome.
For Ardashir had resumed the struggle in his later years (in the reign of
Maximin, between February, 236, and about May, 238), and had taken Nisibis
(Nesibin) and Carrhæ (Haran), the two fortresses round which so many battles
were fought in the course of these wars.</p>

<p>In 242 Sapor had pressed forward to Antioch; but there he was met by
the emperor Gordian, and the latter, or rather his father-in-law Timesitheus,
drove him back and retook the two Mesopotamian strongholds. He
defeated the Persians at Reshaina, and purposed to march upon the Persian
capital. Like Julian after him, he chose the way along the Euphrates; and
somewhat below the junction of the Chaboras with the Euphrates, nearly on
the frontier between the two empires, Gordian was slain by the commander
of the guard, Philip the Arab (beginning of 244). The murderer had himself
proclaimed emperor and hastily concluded a shameful peace with Sapor,
by which he is said to have resigned Armenia and Mesopotamia to him.</p>

<p>There seems then to have been a breathing space of several years, but in
251 or 252 Sapor made a fresh beginning. This time he really occupied
Armenia, which he had not been able to conquer before, and forced the king
to take refuge in Roman territory. From the isolated and contradictory
rumours that have come down to us we can hardly gather how many times the
Persians invaded Syria during this period. Nothing but the frightful decrepitude
of Rome could have rendered such a thing possible. On one occasion
Cyriades, a Syrian, led the Persians right to Antioch, and under their protection
assumed the title of emperor! At last the emperor Valerian marched
against them. For a while the war was waged on Mesopotamian soil, but
fortune turned against the Romans in the end; and the bitterest of all humiliations
befell them, for the emperor himself was taken prisoner by Sapor
(260). Under what circumstances this came to pass we cannot tell; it was
certainly preceded by negotiations in which Valerian vainly tried to secure
an unmolested retreat for himself and his army on payment of a sum of
money. The Romans laid the blame of it on treachery or breach of faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<h4>THE WAR WITH PALMYRA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[260-293 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After taking Valerian captive, Sapor pressed on towards Asia Minor, but
there was met by successful resistance. Many Persians were slaughtered by
Ballista, the Roman general. But the heaviest blow was dealt to the king
by the hand of a romanised Oriental. Odenathus (Odhenat), the chieftain of
the great trading city of Palmyra in the heart of the Syrian desert, is said to
have offered to enter into alliance with him, and to have been completely
repulsed. This is quite possible, for though Palmyra was a part of the
Roman Empire, yet since the emperor was a prisoner and Rome’s dominion
over the East was apparently broken, an ambitious Oriental might easily
have conceived the idea of playing an independent part as an ally of the Great
King. However that may be, Odenathus, on the watch for a favourable place
and opportunity, joined forces with Ballista, attacked the Persians on their
retreat, and inflicted a severe defeat upon them. Part of the royal harem
fell into his hands, and he even besieged Ctesiphon once, if not twice.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Sapor’s reign a great change took place in the oriental
dominions of Rome. He appears to have supported Zenobia, the widow
of Odenathus, against Rome, though without lasting success. By the time
the emperor took Palmyra (273) and restored Roman supremacy over those
regions, Sapor was presumably already dead.</p>

<p>His son Hormuzd (Ohrmazd) I began to reign at the end of 272 or 273.
As a prince he appears to have fought gallantly against the Romans, and is
known to tradition by the surname of “the hero.” Among other legends of
all kinds he is said to have been satrap of Khorasan (which included all the
northeastern provinces) before his accession. As a king he had hardly a
chance of doing great deeds, for he reigned only one year.</p>

<p>According to the evidence of an inscription, his successor Bahram (Varahran)
I was not his son, as tradition has it, but his brother. He is reported
to have been an indolent and voluptuous sovereign. Manes ventured to approach
him, but by the machinations of the priests of Zoroaster he was slain
and his skin was stuffed and hung up to public view. Bahram I reigned
from about 274 to about 277.</p>

<p>Of his son, Bahram II (about 277-294), Persian tradition knows practically
nothing. Two large rock inscriptions, unfortunately much defaced, probably
date from his reign; they are religious, even hortatory in substance, and
strongly hierarchical in tendency. The emperor Probus (276-282) concluded
a peace with him on one occasion; of the struggles which preceded it we have
no knowledge. Probus himself was assassinated before he could resume hostilities,
but Carus carried out his design (283), advanced to the very capital
of the enemy’s empire, and took Ctesiphon and Coche (a part of Seleucia).
The sudden death of the emperor, who is said to have been struck by a flash
of lightning, wrought deliverance for the Persians, for after it the Romans
appear to have withdrawn without much fighting. It is expressly stated
that the arms of Carus were favoured by civil broils among the Persians.
Of such the period was undoubtedly prolific, but we have no exact information
on the subject. In the year 291 a rhetorician referred to the revolt of
Prince Hormuzd (Ormies) against his brother the king, in conjunction with
barbarian tribes.</p>

<p>The youthful son whom Bahram II caused to be figured opposite his consort
upon his coins probably never came to the throne. It seems likely that
after his death two claimants fought for the succession, Bahram III, presumably
a son of Hormuzd, and Narseh, according to an inscription the son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
of Sapor I. At all events Bahram III, who as prince had been satrap of Sakenland
(Sagastan, now Sistan) in the southeast of the empire, and consequently
bore the surname of Sagan Shah (Saken-king), reigned, or at least held
possession of the capital, for a very short time only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[293-339 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Narseh reigned about 293-303. He trod in the footsteps of Sapor, and
conquered Armenia. Cæsar Galerius took the field against him (probably
in 297) but was defeated in Mesopotamia, between Carrhæ and Callinicus
(Rakka). Under the wise direction of Diocletian, however, Galerius soon
restored the lustre of the Roman arms. He completely overthrew Narseh in
Armenia and took his wives and children prisoners. The negotiations for
peace, concerning which we have somewhat more definite information, ended
in a brilliant triumph; for Persia resigned all pretensions to Armenia and
Mesopotamia, and even ceded certain districts on the left of the Tigris, extending
as far as Kurdistan. The king willingly gave up the provinces in
return for the restoration of his family. This peace (dating from 298) lasted
for forty years. Narseh was succeeded by his son Hormuzd II (about 303).
Of his reign we know nothing.</p>

<p>After his death his son Adharnarseh ascended the throne (beginning of
310), but after a very short time was deposed&mdash;on account of his cruelty it is
said&mdash;and probably slain. The nobles, who then had the power in their own
hands, disqualified for rule another (unnamed) son of Hormuzd II by putting
out his eyes, and flung Hormuzd, the third son, into prison. They then
nominated for the kingship the newborn or still unborn son of the queen Ifra&mdash;Hormuzd.
All these events took place in the course of the year 310.
The royal infant was named Sapor II, oppressor of Christians.</p>

<p>The state of things under the rule of his mother and the great nobles
may easily be imagined. But the child developed early into a man capable
of governing alone; he was one of the most famous sovereigns of the dynasty.
Before he had grown to manhood Hormuzd escaped from captivity and fled
to the Romans (323), amongst whom he remained till his death, fighting
with them against Sapor, his half-brother, down to the year 363. Persian
tradition, which has little of a historical nature to tell of Sapor II, gives us
accounts of his adventurous campaigns against the Arabs, who had occupied
or devastated various parts of Persian territory during his minority. These
legends are highly exaggerated, not without an anti-Arab intention; but
there can be no doubt that Sapor zealously devoted himself to the task of
keeping the rapacious Bedouins out of civilised regions&mdash;a very serious problem
for the rulers of countries bordering on the desert. The restoration of
the ancient city of Susa is notable amongst the cities which he founded.
The inhabitants had rebelled against him, and in retaliation he had them put
to death and their city trodden into the dust by elephants; after which he
built it afresh. Nishapur (properly Nev-Shahpuhr), one of the largest cities
of the East down to late mediæval times, was founded either by him or by
Sapor I.</p>

<p>During Sapor’s youth the mighty change had taken place by which Constantine
procured for Christianity the victory over paganism in the Roman
Empire. The Christians in the Persian Empire immediately recognised in
Rome the Christian state <i>par excellence</i>, and were strongly disposed in its
favour. When Sapor went to war with the Romans (337 or 338) they
openly displayed their own sentiments; at least a homily of Aphraates, a
Syrian bishop in the Persian Empire, written about this time, speaks on the
subject in no ambiguous tone. In addition to this, Simon, bishop of the capital,
indulged in such defiant utterances as no oriental monarch was likely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to let pass, least of all a young and energetic sovereign like Sapor II. It
was the signal for conflict, and a frightful persecution of the Christians
began almost simultaneously with the Roman War (339-40). We have an
animated picture of these events in the Syrian <i>Acts of the Martyrs</i>, which
throw much light on other things and persons in the empire. The king was not
actuated by religious fanaticism. The Jews were as obnoxious to his priests
as the Christians, but he left them unmolested. Even in the <i>Acts of the
Martyrs</i> he repeatedly appears as a man wholly without bias in purely religious
matters. But, like Diocletian, he wished to annihilate that state within
the state&mdash;the organisation of the church; and he therefore destroyed church
buildings and took the most vigorous measures against both the superior
and the inferior clergy.</p>

<h4>A NEW WAR WITH ROME</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[337-363 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>According to Roman assertions, the Persians began the war by an
invasion of Mesopotamia. Constantine died before he could take the field
against them (the 22nd of May, 337). But the king’s great preparations date
from the year which begins with the autumn of 337. On the first and
longer half of the war, which lasted with many vicissitudes and long pauses
for twenty-five years, our information is but scanty. On parts of the second,
on the contrary, we possess very full reports by contemporaries and even eye-witnesses.
The king’s object was to deprive the Romans of their possessions
on the upper Tigris, where it must have been exceedingly inconvenient for
the Persians to have them on account of their nearness to Ctesiphon. Above
all, he aimed at taking the strong fortress of Nisibis; and he further desired
to bring Armenia, that old apple of discord between the Eastern and Western
empires, into subjection to himself once more. Three times he closely
besieged Nisibis (in the years 338, 346, and 350), but in vain. Sieges, on
the whole, play a very great part in this war.</p>

<p>If Sapor did not in the long run succeed in gaining great advantages, it
was through no merit of the emperor Constantine, who was invariably defeated
when he took command in person, as, for example, in the famous battle by
night at Singara (Shingar, Arabic Sinjar) (348 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). The main reason was
that the great emperors Diocletian and Constantine had put the fortresses into
admirable condition and taken other excellent measures for the protection of
the provinces exposed to attack. It was a great thing gained that the Persians,
even when victorious, could hardly penetrate into western Mesopotamia.
Moreover the king’s forces were not large enough for him to leave garrisons
in all the fortresses which he took. Thus in 360 Amida (Amid), which Sapor
had taken after a long siege and with heavy loss in the previous year, was
found by the Romans unoccupied. The Romans were also favoured by the
circumstance that the king was at the same time engaged in conflict with
several barbarous tribes. The third siege of Nisibis had almost come to a
successful conclusion when he was obliged suddenly to depart to Khorasan,
where his presence was urgently required.</p>

<p>The wars in the East brought about a long truce (from 350 to 358),
interrupted only by small predatory excursions. But by the time negotiations
were opened on the Roman side (356-358) Sapor had concluded peace
with his enemies in the East, and offered terms which it was quite impossible
to accept. In 359 and 360 hostilities were resumed with energy, and Sapor
took several important fortresses. Another interval of repose ensued; but
in 363 a change came over the whole conduct of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[363-379 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Vigorous, ambitious, and proved in arms, Julian, now sole emperor,
determined to follow the example of Trajan, Septimius Severus, and Carus,
and march straight upon the enemy’s capital. On the 5th of March he left
Antioch, went first to Mesopotamia, and thence proceeded rapidly down the
Euphrates. He ravaged Persian territory with fire and sword, took several
cities after a short siege, among them Mahoz Malka, one of the royal cities
close to Ctesiphon. He even reached Seleucia; but realising that he was not
able to take the strongly fortified city of Ctesiphon on the far side of the Tigris
by storm, he turned to retreat along the left bank of the river. Here for the
first time Sapor’s troops began to annoy him seriously. None the less he
would certainly have led the army back into Roman territory without heavy
loss, but he was mortally wounded in an engagement on the 26th of June, 363.</p>

<p>Jovian, who was chosen emperor by the army after Julian’s death, was by
no means equal to the difficult position in which he found himself, and conducted
both the war and the negotiations in such a manner as ultimately to
bring about a shameful peace. After the death of his dreaded enemy, Sapor
behaved with equal adroitness and moderation. He obtained the retrocession
of the districts to the left of the Tigris, which Galerius had won, and part of
Mesopotamia, including Nisibis and Singara. The Romans with much difficulty
secured permission for the inhabitants of these cities to depart elsewhere.
The cession of Nisibis was the heaviest blow of all, for in all subsequent wars
it was a strong point of departure to the Persians for offensive and defensive
purposes.</p>

<p>More shameful even than these cessions was the stipulation that the
Romans should withdraw their support from King Arsaces of Armenia, who
had sided with them and given him up to Sapor. The king, however, did
not find Armenia easy to conquer. He got Arsaces into his power, but that
did not give him possession, still less permanent possession, of the country,
split up as it was by many natural divisions and ruled by numerous and
almost independent feudal lords. The Christians of Armenia inclined in
the main to the Romans; the Zoroastrians, of whom there were still large numbers,
to the Persians; while the varying private interests of the great
barons, who would have preferred to have no master over them, constituted
a third factor in the situation. The Romans supported, first secretly and
then openly, Papa, the son of Arsaces, who had taken refuge with them, but
only that they might use him as a tool to convert Armenia into a Roman
province. In Iberia (north of Armenia) the adherents of the two empires
likewise came into collision. At the end of five years the country was practically
once more in a state of war. In 371 the Persian king came to open
hostilities with the Roman troops in Armenia, both parties trying to acquire
the country by force or fraud. But however often the negotiations between
them came to naught, the pressure of circumstances (in the case of the Romans,
the troubles with the Goths) and the dictates of reason prevented the outbreak
of a general war.</p>

<h4>ARDASHIR II TO BAHRAM IV</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[379-420 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Sapor II, who by even late tradition is held in honour as a mighty king,
died towards the end of the summer of 379, and was succeeded by his
brother, Ardashir II. The elevation of this old man to the throne may have
been due to the same kind of motives as had prompted the coronation of the
infant Sapor. As prince-satrap of Adiabene (a part of ancient Assyria) he
had taken an active part in the suppression of Christianity as long before as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
344, and again in 376. After his accession, however, the persecution ceased,
perhaps by deliberate intention, perhaps out of mere oriental indolence.
Even the capital could have its bishop again. But, having taken forcible
action against the great nobles and put several of them to death, Ardashir
was deposed by them in 383 or 384.</p>

<p>His successor, Sapor III, the son of Sapor II, had no sooner ascended
the throne than he despatched ambassadors to Constantinople, and there
concluded a settled peace (384). He reigned only a short time, being
murdered by the nobles in 388 or 389.</p>

<p>His son (or possibly brother) and successor, Bahram IV, who bore the surname
of Kerman Shah, “king of Carmania,” because as prince he had ruled
that province, remained on friendly terms with the Romans and was clement
towards the Christians. In 390 the two empires divided Armenia between
them by treaty, in such a manner that by far the greater part became a vassal
state to Persia and the remainder to Rome. There were many complications
still to come, but this division nevertheless remained in force down to Arab
times. Bahram IV also died a violent death, being slain by the arrows of
“evil-doers,” in the summer of 399.</p>

<h4>THE RULE OF YEZDEGERD I</h4>

<p>His successor, Yezdegerd I, a son of Sapor II or Sapor III, seemed to
have been designated as heir to the throne or otherwise invested with some
sovereign dignity even during the life-time of Bahram IV, for his name
appears on coins in conjunction with the king’s.</p>

<p>For all that he was far from being a Christian, and did not scruple to
visit with severe chastisement the blind zeal which led Bishop Abda of
Susiana to violate Zoroastrian sanctuaries. But the measure of toleration
which he extended to Christianity was enough to rouse the hatred of the
Persian priesthood, while the warlike nobility were probably ill pleased by
his earnest desire to maintain peace with Rome. In the summer of 408 he
concluded a firm treaty of peace and alliance, by which he seems to have
undertaken a formal guarantee for the reign of the emperor Theodosius II,
then a minor. He set a trustworthy vassal king over Persian Armenia
in the person of his son Sapor. We have every reason to regard him as a
skilful ruler for his time and country. But he was not well pleasing to the
god of Persia. Wherefore he caused him to die suddenly in marvellous
wise in far Hyrcania. We prosaically interpret this miracle to mean that
he was murdered by the despotic nobles (probably late in the summer of
420); even as his three predecessors had been violently deprived of their
sovereignty, and two of them murdered.</p>

<p>After his death, his son Sapor hastened from Armenia to the capital,
no doubt intending to become king of the empire, but was murdered by the
great nobles, for the latter were so exasperated against Yezdegerd that they
resolved to exclude his sons from the succession. They chose a distant
relative of his, Chosroes by name, to be their king. But another son of
Yezdegerd, Bahram by name, contested his claim to the throne. During his
father’s life-time this son had lived, presumably in a sort of banishment, with
al-Mundhir (Alamundaros) the Arab king of Hira (west of the Euphrates
and on the borders of the desert), a powerful vassal king. The latter supported
Bahram’s pretensions with all his might, and this is probably the first
time that the Arabs effectively interfered in the course of Persian history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<h4>THE ARABS AID IN WAR WITH ROME</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[420-457 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Mundhir, with vast hordes of Arabs behind him, was soon at the gates
of the capital, which lay only three or four days’ journey distant from Hira,
and no doubt the rightful heir to the throne could count upon a party
among the Persians. A compromise was therefore effected between the
disputants, Chosroes withdrew his claim, and Bahram ascended the throne,
but under promise to rule differently from his father and to do the will of
the nobles and priests. Bahram V, who bears the surname of Gor, “the
wild ass,” is a favourite with Persian tradition, which tells absolutely fabulous
stories of him. He was young when he became king, and to the end of his
days he was jovial and much addicted to women. The change of policy
was immediately signalised by two things&mdash;the outbreak of a systematic
persecution of the Christians, and a war with Rome. Both sides could
easily find pretexts for war, but it is most likely that the Persian nobles
urged it on; the Romans would certainly not have entered on the struggle
merely on account of the persecution.</p>

<p>The main theatre of war was in Persian Mesopotamia and the mountain
tracts that bounded it on the north. The Persian commander was Mihr
Narseh, one of the most powerful nobles. A vainglorious Persian tradition
relates that he made a victorious entry into Constantinople, but we know
that, on the contrary, he suffered a severe defeat at the very beginning of the
war (August, 421). The Romans besieged Nisibis for a long time, but the approach
of a fresh force compelled them hastily to raise the siege. Mundhir, to
whom Bahram owed his throne, was eager to devastate Syria with his Arabs,
but was forced to retreat with great loss. The war, concerning the progress
of which we have no adequate information, enfeebled both sides to such an
extent that they quickly became anxious to end it. In the terms of peace
(422) the Persians promised to allow the Christians the free exercise of their
religion, and the Romans undertook to do likewise to the Zoroastrians.</p>

<p>The desire of the Persians for peace was most likely due to the fact that
they were again involved in warfare with the rulers of the Bactria of that day
and the neighbouring countries, the tribe of the Kushan, Haital (Hephthalites),
or “white Huns.” To this perpetual conflict the Romans probably
owed their rest from Persian invasion in the fifth century. We are not
bound to take the word of Persian tradition for Bahram’s brilliant victory
over the Hephthalites.</p>

<p>In Persian Armenia yearnings after independence had asserted themselves
during the war with Rome, but when peace was concluded Bahram
could again install a vassal king there; the selfish Armenian nobles, however,
went to such lengths that the Persians were finally driven to do away
with the Armenian monarchy altogether and to convert the country into a
province (429), as the Romans had long since done with their portion of it.
In this the Persians had the assistance of a strong party among the Armenians
themselves, though as a matter of fact the Persian satraps had no less
trouble with the barons and priests than with the kings before them.</p>

<p>After the death of Bahram (438 or 439) his son Yezdegerd II became king.
He persecuted both Christians and Jews, nor is there much to be set to his
credit in other respects. He abolished the audiences, on the first day of every
month, in which any man of consequence was free to lay grievances or petitions
before the king. The story goes that he married his own daughter
(though that was no crime in the opinion of the Zoroastrians, who considered
such marriages positively meritorious) and afterwards killed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<h4>WAR WITH THE HEPHTHALITES</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[457-489 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Upon the death of Yezdegerd II (457) a quarrel seems to have broken out
immediately between his sons, Hormuzd III, king (that is to say, “prince-satrap”)
of Sagastan, and Peroz, who were the children of one mother,
Dinak by name. Hormuzd, the elder, held his ground for a while, but at the
end of two years Peroz supplanted him by the help of the Hephthalites and
the active exertions of Raham, of the noble house of Mihran. He caused
three others of his nearest kinsmen to be put to death, as well as his brother.
He, again, was hostile to Christians and Jews, but he had political insight
enough to favour the conversion of his Christian subjects to the doctrines of
Nestorius, which had been banished as archheresy from the Roman Empire.
At the synod held at Beth Lapat in the year 483 or 484, the ancient Christian
church of the Persian Empire adopted the Nestorian confession; and
being thenceforward separated by a great gulf from the Roman Christians,
was consequently even less dangerous to the state than it had been before.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, Christianity in Persia had never been really
much of a menace to the country. The Armenians on the other hand
joined the monophysites, who had a large party in the Roman Empire and
often had the upper hand there.</p>

<p>Whether the Hephthalites wanted heavier payment for their assistance
than had been previously agreed upon, or whether Peroz did not keep promises
he had actually made, the end was that great conflicts ensued between
them and the Persians. Peroz won some victories; but in the desert country
east of the Caspian Sea the conduct of war is hampered by enormous
difficulties. Twice he was compelled to conclude peace on unfavourable
terms, once at least he himself fell into the hands of his enemies, and for two
years his son Kavadh had to remain in the enemy’s camp as a hostage for the
payment of his heavy ransom. Nevertheless Peroz was perpetually breaking
the pledges he had given. In 484 he took the field with a large army. A
tremendous battle ensued, in which Peroz perished among the unrecognised
slain. His daughter was among the prisoners, and the king of the Hephthalites
took her into his harem.</p>

<p>Evil days were now in store for Persia. The victors overran the country.
For a time there was no king. Presently, however, Zarmihr, of the
powerful house of the Karen, succeeded in restoring order in the empire.
At the time of Peroz’s death this man had been in Armenia, which had rebelled
again, and had almost completed its subjugation. He then hastened
to the capital and installed Balash, a brother of the late ruler, as king. In
all probability he afterward entered into negotiations with the victorious
enemy, and bought him off with a yearly tribute.</p>

<p>A brother of Balash, Zareh by name, who likewise aspired to the crown,
was defeated and slain. The king, however, had but little authority. He was
obliged to induce the Armenians to submit by allowing them to exclude the
state religion of Persia from their country altogether. The praise which
the Syrians and the Armenians render to Balash’s clemency may perhaps
have no other foundation than his disagreements with the priests of Zoroaster.
The enmity thus aroused proved fatal to him. His treasury, of course, was
empty, so that he could neither form a party among the nobles nor attach
an army to himself; and in 488 or 489 the priests went so far as to have
him blinded and so made incapable of governing. For according to the
law of Persia no man could be king who was not whole and sound in body
and mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<h4>KAVADH I</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[489-506 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>His nephew, Kavadh I, the son of Peroz, was set in his place. He found
the empire in a state of great disorder. We hear of revolts of savage mountain
tribes, and of another rebellion in Armenia. Kavadh, who had no
inclination to play the obedient servant to the tyrants who had raised him
to the throne, adopted a dangerous method of weakening the power of
priests and nobles; for he favoured Mazdak, a zealous preacher of religious-socialistic
doctrines, who demanded in the name of justice that he who was
blest with riches and possessed of many wives should give of his superfluity
to those who were in want. Nor did he rest satisfied with the theory, for
many of his disciples distributed their wives and goods. But the nobles and
clergy united to depose Kavadh, imprisoned him in the “castle of oblivion,”
and bestowed the crown on his brother Jamasp (about 496). Kavadh,
however, escaped, and fled to the Hephthalites, among whom he had formerly
lived as a hostage. The king gave him his daughter to wife, the child of
that sister of Kavadh who had been taken in battle; and by the help of
the barbarian prince he succeeded in overthrowing Jamasp and once more
becoming king of Persia (498 or 499). His flight and restoration appear
to have been favoured by some of the most powerful nobles. According to
Persian tradition Zarmihr actually accompanied him into exile, but such testimony
as we have concerning this man and the flight to the Hephthalites is
so confused that we can place no reliance upon it. Certain it is that after
his return the king visited his enemies with severe chastisement. Presumably
he abandoned Zarmihr about that time, for he handed him over to his
most formidable rival, Sapor, of the house of Mihran. It is not likely that
Kavadh then resumed his experiment with the Mazdakites.</p>

<h4>NEW CONFLICT WITH ROME</h4>

<p>He had certainly reduced the empire to tolerable order by the time the
war with the Romans began. There had been much treating over terms,
both parties had violated compacts more or less, and the only question was
whether either of them was desirous of finding a <i>casus belli</i>. This was the
case with Kavadh. In the summer of 502 he inaugurated that era of hideous
strife which so reduced the strength of both Persia and Eastern Rome as to
make possible the subsequent victories of the Arabs. In August he took
Theodosiopolis (Karin or Erzerum), the capital of Roman Armenia, without
a blow. On the 10th of January, 503, Amida fell after a three months’ siege,
and was frightfully punished for its resistance. Myriads of the inhabitants
were slaughtered, as we know from the good accounts we have in existing
contemporary Syrian sources.</p>

<p>In this war, of which very full contemporary accounts have come down
to us, especially from Syrian sources, the Roman operations were conducted
without the necessary energy, and lacked the direction of a single commander.
Mesopotamia was fearfully ravaged. In 504 the Romans regained
possession of Amida, after a long siege, by treaty, or more correctly speaking
by purchase. After many battles and sieges peace was concluded in the
August of 506, a peace which left everything <i>in statu quo ante</i>. The Romans
once more undertook to pay an annual contribution towards the maintenance
of the fortifications in the Caucasus. The Persians are said to have been
induced to conclude peace by a war with the “Huns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[506-554 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the vague fashion in which the Greek authors of that time use
the word “Huns” we cannot tell which of the tribes of northern barbarians
is here meant. That Kavadh was at this time involved in serious difficulties
at home or abroad may be inferred from the fact that he did not forcibly
prevent a gross violation of the treaty of peace on the part of the emperor
Anastasius, who converted the little village of Dara, close upon the frontier,
into a great fortress intended to keep Nisibis in check. There was no
further outbreak of hostilities during the life-time of Anastasius; but Justin I
(July the 9th, 518-August the 1st, 527) appears to have intermitted the payment
of the moneys stipulated to Persia.</p>

<p>In return Kavadh incited the Arabs to make predatory raids into Roman
territory, and Roman troops once more invaded and ravaged Armenia. In
addition, violent quarrels arose about the Caucaso-Pontic districts, over
which both sides claimed dominion. This time, however, Kavadh was little
disposed towards war; perhaps he had realised that he could hardly hope to
gain any permanent advantage. In the perpetual renewal of negotiations
he had only one main object in view; he was anxious to procure the succession
for Chosroes, the best beloved of his sons and certainly the most capable
of ruling the empire, although he was not the eldest; and for this purpose
he wished for a kind of guarantee from the emperor, which should take the
form of an adoption of Chosroes by the latter. Negotiations concerning this
and other matters were carried on at Nisibis. If matters went as they are
represented to have gone, the Romans acted most perversely; in any case the
negotiations had no other result than to put both parties out of humour.
The chiefs of the Roman embassy escaped with no worse than degradation,
the Persians were executed, though personally they deserved well of the
king. These negotiations took place in 525 or 526; the war began again
before the death of Justin. There was hard fighting on the frontier as early
as the summer of 527, the Romans making a vain assault on Nisibis, and the
Persians an equally fruitless attempt on Dara.</p>

<h4>EXPLOITS OF MUNDHIR</h4>

<p>In these many years of war, with frequent pauses for negotiation, Belisarius
first comes into prominence as a commander. One noteworthy event,
among others, is Mundhir’s great invasion of Syria. This Mundhir was the
Arab vassal-prince of Hira, of the same line as the prince of the same name.
He seems before this to have grown so powerful as to rouse Kavadh’s apprehensions,
and the latter therefore deprived him, either wholly or in part, of
his dominions for a time, in favour of Harith, a member of the much-ramified
family of the Kinda kings. The statement that this event bore some relation
to the Mazdakite troubles is hardly probable.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the war with Rome, however, Kavadh restored the
whole of his former dominions to the tried warrior Mundhir. In the spring
of 529 the latter invaded Syria, laid the whole country waste as far as
Antioch, and carried off troops of captives that he might secure their
ransom. He was a savage who in one day slaughtered four hundred nuns
from a Syrian nunnery in honour of his goddess Zuhara (the planet Venus).
In the same year his rival Harith went to war with him, and Mundhir
caused a number of members of the princely family of Kinda, who had fallen
into his hands, to be put to death at Hira. For half a century he was the
terror of Roman subjects, troubling himself little to inquire whether peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
prevailed or not, till at length he fell in battle against the Roman prince of
the Arabs, Harith, the son of Jabala (June, 554), whose captive son he had
likewise sacrificed to Zuhara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[531-540 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It was Mundhir who induced Kavadh, after an interval, to undertake a
campaign in Syria itself (531). The Persians advanced far to the north
along the right bank of the Euphrates, but were compelled to retreat by
Belisarius. A battle was fought at Callinicus (Rakka), near the frontier
that is, in which Belisarius was totally defeated; but the Persian commander
was nevertheless obliged to return home. The Persians gained some successes
in Mesopotamia the same year, and had almost reduced the great
fortress of Martyropolis (Maiferkat, Arabic Mayafarikin) when tidings came
of the death of the king, and brought about a truce.</p>

<p>A few years before his death Kavadh had brought the Mazdakites to a
horrible end. The sect seems to have grown so powerful that it could no
longer be tolerated; for, in spite of all its theoretic idealism it threatened
to subvert the foundations of society and the state. The catastrophe, which
was accompanied by lavish bloodshed, took place in 528 or 529, under the
orders of Prince Chosroes, acting in agreement with the king.</p>

<p>Kavadh died on the 13th of September, 531, aged eighty-two. He certainly
destined Chosroes for his successor; and according to a report we may well
credit, he had him crowned on his death-bed. Chosroes I (Chosrau), who
bears the surname of <i>Anosharvan</i>, “the blessed,” was undoubtedly a great
king. It is true that he was by no means the ideal king that Orientals
make him out to have been, but neither does he bear the title of “the just”
without due reason.</p>

<h4>CHOSROES “THE JUST”</h4>

<p>The negotiation taken in hand on his accession led in the course of a year
to an “eternal peace” (September, 532). The Romans agreed to make a
large annual payment and other concessions, the Persians gave up some
castles in Lazistan (the ancient Colchis, at the eastern extremity of the
Black Sea). The conclusion of peace was evidently a matter of great moment
to the Persian king. He probably availed himself at once of this breathing
space to protect his frontiers from barbarians of all kinds. Tradition is
certainly right in attributing to him comprehensive measures for the defence
of the Caucasus and northeastern frontier, among which was the forcible
transplantation of unruly tribes.</p>

<p>In a few years he felt himself strong enough to take up hostilities against
the Romans once more. Perhaps he really feared that the result of the
success of Justinian’s arms in Italy and Africa would be to make the Roman
Empire too strong for him. No doubt the messengers sent by Witiges, king
of the Goths, had painted the perils which would ensue to Persia from
them in the liveliest colours. He probably found an incitement even more
powerful in the fact that the Armenian nobles, who had rebelled in consequence
of many acts of injustice, applied to him for aid although they
were Christians.</p>

<h4>CHOSROES ATTACKS ROME</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[540-551 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>There was no lack of petty violations of the treaty by one side or the
other; the Arabs on both sides alone took good care of that. At all events
Chosroes was this time eager for war, and he therefore started early in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
year 540 to invade Syria as Sapor I had done. He passed by the strongly
fortified cities which bought him off by the payment of large sums, those
which offered resistance he took. This fate fell heaviest upon Antiochia,
the metropolis. The army left it laden with booty, which included many
works of art. He burned the city and carried off its inhabitants. After
advancing to the shores of the “Roman” Sea, he continued his victorious
progress through northern Syria and Mesopotamia, from west to east. The
fortress of Dara, which had always been an eyesore to the Persians because
it had been built in contravention of the treaty, was obliged to purchase
safety at a price. None went free without payment except the inhabitants
of Carrhæ, who, being still heathen, might be supposed to entertain sympathy
for the non-Christian empire. At the end of the summer he reached Ctesiphon
again, without having encountered any open resistance in the field.</p>

<p>In the second year of the war Chosroes marched to Lazistan at the request
of the inhabitants, penetrated to the Black Sea, and there took the strong
fortress of Petra. The struggle was continued for several years in Mesopotamia
with variable fortune. In 546 a truce was concluded for five years on
payment of a large sum of money by the Romans. But Lazistan territory
was excluded from the operation of the truce, both then and in 553, when
the armistice was prolonged for a further period of five years. The Arabs
of the two empires also continued to fight with one another. Not until 556
was the armistice extended to Lazistan, the Roman arms having made some
progress in the meantime, and about Christmas, 562, a peace was concluded
for fifty years.</p>

<p>The Romans again pledged themselves to pay a considerable sum every
year, the Persians resigned their claims to Lazistan, but the question of who
should possess the neighbouring province of Suania remained undecided.
Our information concerning the articles of this peace happens to be exceptionally
detailed; one important provision is that, though stipulating for full
religious liberty for Persian Christians, the Romans recognise that they are
prohibited from proselytising among Zoroastrians; and consequently that
severe punishment inflicted for the infringement of this prohibition does not
constitute a violation of the articles of peace.</p>

<p>In the attempt to conquer Yemen (about 570) we have in actual fact a
somewhat wild undertaking. The country had been occupied in 525 by the
Christian Abyssinians. A prince of Yemen besought Chosroes to aid him in
delivering the country from the negroes. After some hesitation the king
despatched a small force under Vahriz by sea, which actually succeeded
in overcoming the feeble resistance of the Abyssinian army and bringing
the country into subjection to the king. It remained nominally under the
sovereignty of Persia until it became Moslem, but the empire reaped no
advantage from this remote province beyond a certainly scanty and probably
irregular tribute.</p>

<p>A country to which the sea offered the only convenient approach could be
of no use to a race so utterly ignorant of navigation as the Persians, and we
find no vestige of sea-borne traffic between Yemen and Persia. Chosroes may
indeed have had some idea of diverting commercial advantages from the
Romans and procuring them for the Persians, just as in other respects commercial
interests play their part in the hostile and amicable relations of the
empire; as was done, for instance, and to a very great extent, by the silk
trade with the interior of Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[551-578 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The king was not exempt from strife within the borders of his dominions.
About 551 his son Anoshazadh, who for some offence had been banished to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Susiana, hearing that his father was seriously ill, proclaimed himself king
and persisted in his rebellion. He relied upon the Christians, his mother’s
co-religionists, but was soon overcome and taken prisoner. He was not
executed, but merely rendered ineligible for the throne by a slight facial
disfigurement.</p>

<p>In the later years of his life Chosroes was again involved in war with the
Romans, who this time allied themselves with the Turkish chagan, now a
formidable foe of Persia. The Persians did all they could to prevent intercourse
between him and the Romans. The Romans likewise complained of
the destruction of the Christian kingdom of Yemen. But these were secondary
considerations. Even the refusal of the emperor, Justin II (November
14th, 565-6, to October, 578), to pay to Persia the sum stipulated by
treaty would probably not have led to a direct rupture.</p>

<p>But the Persians could not tamely submit to see the whole of Armenia
become Roman. Armenian nobles were once more contemplating rebellion;
the clergy and the fanatical mob raised a tumult when it was proposed to
erect a temple of Fire at Dovin, the capital, and Suren, a Persian, was slain
(spring of 571). The rebels turned to Constantinople; the king of Iberia
(to the north of Armenia) did likewise. The incompetent emperor imagined
that both countries might fall to Rome again, and took them under his protection.
It was the signal for war. Excellent as are the contemporary
reports of this war which have come down to us, we have no complete and
chronologically exact summary of its progress. At the very beginning
Nisibis was besieged to no purpose by the Romans; Chosroes, on the other
hand, took Dara after a six months’ siege (573), while his general, Adharmahan,
invaded Syria by way of the right bank of the Euphrates, and
there perpetrated ravages similar to those for which his master had been
responsible in 540. He destroyed Apamea and carried the inhabitants away
into captivity. After marching through Mesopotamia he joined forces with
the king before Dara. Some of the captives he settled in New Antioch.</p>

<p>Tiberius, who directed the government at Constantinople in concert with
the empress Sophia and was formally appointed co-regent on the 7th of December,
574, was anxious for peace. But even the conclusion of a truce for
three years did not bring about real tranquillity, as Armenia was not included
in the armistice. Early in the year 575 Chosroes marched through Armenia
and penetrated a long way towards Cappadocia. He was obliged to withdraw
before the Roman troops, who actually plundered his camp, but could
not prevent him from burning Sebastia and Melitene and getting safely
home. His Roman pursuers occupied a great part of Persian Armenia and
wintered there, but were driven out of it in the following year.</p>

<p>That the Romans displayed no more humanity than the Persians is clear
from the fact that they carried off even the Christian inhabitants of the Persian
border-provinces of Arzanene, and considered it a singular favour to assign
dwelling-places to them in Cyprus (577). Negotiations for peace were set on
foot again and again. After recent experiences the Roman claims to Persian
Armenia and Iberia were readily renounced at Constantinople. On the
point of honour that the temporal and spiritual nobles of Armenia who had
taken refuge at Constantinople should not be handed over to the vengeance
of the Persians, an understanding might also have been arrived at. Dara
was still a great stumbling-block, the Romans insisting on its restoration,
with excellent reason. For all that, peace would probably have been concluded
if Chosroes had not died (about February, 579) shortly after Tiberius
had become sole monarch (October 4th or 6th, 578).</p>

<h4>HORMUZD IV</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[578-590 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The new king, Hormuzd IV, son of Chosroes and the daughter of the
Turkish chagan, was haughty and enterprising. It produced an unpleasant
impression at Constantinople that he sent no notification of his accession
thither, for even in time of war announcements of this sort had been
ceremoniously made by both courts. Altogether Greek authors criticise
Hormuzd very unfavourably, and even Persian tradition testifies that he
was spiteful and shed much blood. We know on the evidence of a contemporary
that he put his brothers to death when he came to the throne, but
the same authority states that this was a barbarous custom among the
Persians. On the other hand, Persian tradition reports that he exercised
strict justice without respect of persons, and zealously took the part of the
common man against the noble. The weight of his severity fell upon
the great. This agrees with the fact that he took thought for the soldiers
in the ranks and treated the aristocratic cuirassiers with slight regard. He
also incurred the wrath of the priests by a decision which does him the
highest honour, for he ironically rejected their petition that he should place
Christians at a disadvantage. In many points he seems to have resembled
the first Yezdegerd, whose fate he likewise shared. It was his misfortune
that he did not possess the intellectual superiority which enabled his father
to control the nobles, both temporal and spiritual.</p>

<p>The war with Rome lasted through the whole of his reign, and the
repeated attempts at negotiations came to nought. Sometimes one side was
victorious, sometimes the other. To this war was added an unfortunate
war with the Turks. Against them Hormuzd despatched Bahram Chobin.
He succeeded in gaining a brilliant victory over them, or rather over one of
their vassals, and took much booty; and even, as the story goes, converted
the Persian tribute to the Turks into a Turkish tribute to the
Persians. The victorious general was next sent (589) to the countries
south of the Caucasus, there to aim a mighty blow at the Romans. Bahram,
however, was totally routed. Hormuzd was then guilty of the folly of
dismissing this experienced commander, the head of the house of Mihran,
with ignominy.</p>

<h4>CIVIL WAR</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[590-592 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Bahram retaliated by open rebellion. His army took his part. He very
likely knew how disaffected the nobles were, and could count upon malcontents
among the rest of the troops. The army in Mesopotamia, which
had retreated to Nisibis after being defeated by the Romans and dreaded
the vengeance of the king, mutinied and joined Bahram, though without resigning
its independence. Bahram had advanced as far as the great Zab
(not far from the Mosul of to-day) on his way to the capital, when he was
confronted by a royal army. But this army likewise rebelled, not, indeed, in
Bahram’s favour, but in favour of Chosroes, the king’s son. Some of these
troops reached Ctesiphon soon after, whither Hormuzd had hurried from
Media on receipt of the fatal tidings. The city was given over to tumult.
Bindoe, whose sister was Chosroes’ mother, was imprisoned there (a fate
most liable to befall an oriental noble); his brother Bistam (Vistahm)
liberated him by force, and the nobles proceeded to depose Hormuzd and
proclaim Chosroes king (summer of 590). He was on bad terms with his
father, and the movement certainly did not come upon him as a surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
How far he was implicated in the assassination of Hormuzd, which soon followed,
we cannot tell with any degree of certainty; most likely he let that
happen which he could not well prevent.</p>

<p>Chosroes II, surnamed <i>Parvez</i>, “the victorious,” tried in vain to win
Bahram over to his side. The latter himself wished to reign either in the
name of a prince who was not of age, or preferably in his own. Chosroes
marched against him, but his army was not loyal. The famous general
commanded more respect than the faint-hearted king, whose troops deserted
him after the first serious engagement. Chosroes, with his family
and a few faithful followers, fled into Syria, to the Romans. When he had
reached the frontier city of Circesium, he wrote to implore the aid of the
emperor Maurice (who had been on the throne since the 14th of August,
582). The latter was not adroit enough to take advantage of this extraordinarily
favourable situation for the benefit of his empire, for he undertook
to restore Chosroes without stipulating for a fair equivalent. A man of
mean origin himself, he probably felt flattered by the mere fact of being
called upon to reinstate a legitimate king of ancient lineage and being able
to declare himself “father” of such a one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bahram, after some hesitation, had caused himself to be
proclaimed king and had struck coins in his own name. He had also been
fortunate enough to get Bindoe into his power. But Bahram’s was but a
tottering throne from the outset. The nobles would not submit to a man
who had been their equal. Even in the Parthian Empire, however, often
kings were deposed and raised to the throne; it had always been accounted
right that none but an Arsacid should wear the crown, and in the empire of
the Sassanids the legitimist sentiment was much stronger. In the popular
mind the “ancient royal majesty” (<i>farrahi kayanik</i>) was bound up with the
house of Ardaschir, and no other could reign.</p>

<p>There was a rising even in Ctesiphon itself, which was put down by
Bahram, though Bindoe escaped during the tumult, further to exert himself
on his nephew’s behalf. By the beginning of 591 an imperial army was in
the field to reinstate Chosroes. Martyropolis, which had fallen into the
hands of the Persians through treachery, and had already been blockaded
for a considerable time, was given over to the Romans by Chosroes; so was
Dara. The Persian army at Nisibis went over to him, and increased from
day to day by the arrival of Persian nobles, among whom were barons
from Armenia. Bistam collected an army at Aderbaijan to march against
Bahram; the main Romano-Persian army advanced upon him to the left of
the Tigris, but before ever they came into touch with the enemy, a royal force
which had been sent in advance straight through the Mesopotamian desert
had taken the capital cities of Ctesiphon, Seleucia, and New Antiochia.</p>

<p>All men took the part of their lawful sovereign, and in the great battle
that was fought near the Zab, Bahram was completely routed (summer of
591). He fled to the Turks, by whom he was received with honour, but
soon afterwards assassinated. Chosroes was escorted to Ctesiphon by
the Romans, and as a matter of course peace was concluded between
Rome and Persia. Equally of course the payment of tribute was dropped;
but the frontiers remained as they had been before the war, and Nisibis was
left in the hands of the Persians.</p>

<p>Chosroes still felt so insecure on his throne that he begged the emperor
to leave him a body-guard of one thousand Romans. His first thought
was to rid himself of all dangerous characters, and especially of those who had
compassed his father’s fall and his own elevation to the throne. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
others he had his uncle, Bindoe, put to death; but Bindoe’s brother Bistam
was beyond his reach. When the latter saw that his death was determined
upon, he followed Bahram’s example, assumed the title of king in Media,
and had coins struck. He too was of ancient lineage, and he too could not
gain the prestige of the legitimate line. He seems to have relied upon
the remnants of Bahram’s forces, and to have entered into alliance with the
Turks and Delamites. He withstood Chosroes’ troops for nearly six years,
till he fell by treachery (probably at the end of 595 or the beginning
of 596).</p>

<h4>VICES OF CHOSROES II</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[592-610 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>These disorders must have sadly distracted the empire, which had been
sufficiently enfeebled before by the long wars in the east and the west. Nor
was Chosroes II the sagacious, strong, and humane ruler whom it required
under these circumstances. At best he was a very ordinary type of oriental
prince. Weak at bottom, he was at the same time boastful and cowardly,
and to ostentation and luxury he added the much more harmful fault of
avarice. At his death the royal treasuries, which he had found empty, were
full, while his dominions were impoverished by war. Some excuse may be
found in the circumstances of the time for his conduct towards those who
had helped him to the throne. In war he never distinguished himself, his
victories are only those of his generals. He did indeed protect the Christians,
he even treated them with distinction, and built churches for them;
but he did it partly on account of the impression made upon him by the
help of the Romans and (as he himself thought) the assistance of St. Sergius,
the patron saint of the Syrians and Arabs in the Roman Empire, partly
at the instigation of Shirin, his favourite wife, who was an ardent Christian,
and of others, such as his Christian physician in ordinary, Gabriel.
In later days Chosroes’ friendship for the Christians was turned into the
opposite sentiment. And we know that he was a man of gross character.</p>

<p>After Maurice had been overthrown by a mutiny and slain, and the vile
Phocas elevated to the imperial throne (November, 602), Chosroes looked
upon himself as in a state of war against the Romans, in the capacity of
avenger of his “father” Maurice, and protector of his putative son Theodosius,
who had taken refuge with him. Furthermore Narses, who was in
command at Edessa, appealed to him against Phocas. Chosroes, therefore,
made a beginning by imprisoning the ambassadors by whose hand Phocas
informed him of his accession. The actual war probably commenced at the
beginning of 604. For twenty years the Roman Empire was overrun by
Persian armies as it never had been before, so disordered was it by Phocas,
so harassed by Avars and other barbarous tribes. Chosroes was present in
person at the taking of Dara, after which he took no active part in the war.
In a few years the Persian armies had pressed forward far on the road to
Asia Minor, even reaching Chalcedon, opposite Constantinople.</p>

<p>The fact that the power of the Persian Empire was not very firmly based
for all that, is shown by an event, in itself insignificant, which falls within
this period (between 604 and 610), the battle of Dhu Kar. Chosroes had
abolished the kingdom of Hira, and caused Nohman, the last king, to be
put to death. By this means the empire was quit of a vassal state which had
often proved troublesome; but, on the other hand, it was henceforward far
more difficult to gain an ascendency over the savage tribes of the desert, and
prevent them from making raids upon the cultivated regions. After the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
fall of Nohman, the Bedouin tribes of Bekr ben Wail succeeded in inflicting
a total defeat on an imperial army consisting of Arabs and Persian regular
troops at Dhu Kar, not far from the Euphrates and a few days’ march from
Ctesiphon, and holding the territory out of which the Persians wished to
drive them. This victory of Arabs over Persians, magnified by national
vanity, greatly encouraged the former in their self-esteem, and strengthened
the confidence of the Moslems when they attacked the empire.</p>

<h4>CONFLICT WITH HERACLIUS; FALL OF CHOSROES II</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[610-628 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The war with the Romans continued to make successful progress, after
Phocas had been overthrown, by his able successor Heraclius (October, 610).
The latter, seeing himself hard pressed on all sides, sued in vain for peace.
Damascus was taken in 613. The surrounding country, which had never
been trodden by Persian feet since the founding of the empire, was laid so
utterly waste that to this day countless ruins bear witness to these ravages.
In the June of 614 Jerusalem was taken. The whole of Christendom was
horrified by the tidings that, together with the patriarch, the Persians had
carried off the “Holy life-giving Cross” of Christ. Egypt was next conquered,
and Asia Minor again overrun as far as to Chalcedon. Not till 622
was Heraclius able to take the field against the Persians. He took ship for
the Bay of Issus, thence pressed forward to Armenia and the regions about
the Pontus, and for the first time in the campaign inspired the enemy with
respect for the Roman arms. The loss of church treasures must be reckoned
as a heavy item in the cost of the war. On the 15th of March, 623,
Heraclius at length started upon the great military expedition which led
him again and again into the heart of Persian territory. The almost
extravagant daring of his cross-marches and transverse marches, in which
he was generally deprived of all communication with his base and must
have had great difficulty in feeding his troops, prove him a great commander
and a great statesman.</p>

<p>In the first year of the campaign he destroyed one of the most sacred
sanctuaries of the Persians, the Fire temple of Ganjak, not far from the
Lake of Urumiyeh; it was his reply to the destruction of Jerusalem. We
find him now in the vicinity of the Caucasus, now in the east of Asia Minor,
now, again, in Mesopotamia, never vanquished, often victorious, more often
still, it may be, weakening or deluding superior forces by skilful movements.
Chosroes, who felt the emperor disquietingly near at Ganjak, sent Shahrbaraz,
the most famous of his generals, with a great army direct to Chalcedon
to draw him off (626).</p>

<p>It was an anxious time for Constantinople, with the Persians on this side
and the Avars on that (in the summer of 626), and the emperor almost
beyond knowledge in the remote parts of Asia. But the Avars soon withdrew,
seeing that the Persians, having no fleet, could not undertake concerted
operations with them on the far side of the Bosporus. In retaliation
Heraclius brought the savage Khazars, from the north of the Caucasus, into
Persian territory. At length, in 627, he ventured into the chief province of
the monarchy. He kept the “feast of lights” (January 6th, 628) at Dastagerd,
only about three days’ journey from Ctesiphon, where Chosroes had
held his court regularly for the last twenty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[628-629 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The king had fled in terror, not feeling safe till he and his harem had
the bridge of the Tigris at Ctesiphon behind them. Heraclius had naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
accomplished his tremendous march from the Caucasus with comparatively
few troops, and was in no position to attack the capital, strongly fortified and
protected by waterways as it was. On the contrary, before the king had
collected a large army he withdrew, but only to Ganjak, thus remaining
on the enemy’s soil; and in February and March traversed the Alps of
Kurdistan amidst perpetual snow-storms, a feat which has not often been
matched in the annals of war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile important events had been taking place at Ctesiphon. Chosroes’
tyranny and extortion had exasperated high and low alike; by his
cowardly flight he had forfeited the respect of his people. In addition, he
had designated Mardanshah&mdash;his son by Shirin, who still governed him
wholly in spite of her years and his thousands of other wives&mdash;as his successor,
to the exclusion of Kavadh. The latter was imprisoned in a fortress
with most of his brothers. Some nobles, among whom was a Christian,
Shamta, son of the deceased farmer-general Ezdin, now set Kavadh at
liberty and proclaimed him king (February 25th, 628). Chosroes, deserted
by all men, was dragged out of his hiding-place, put in prison, and, after a
few days, executed (the 29th of February, 628). Thus miserably and horribly
perished the man whose camps extended almost to the borders of the
Achæmenid Empire. No hand was raised to defend or avenge him. The
Christians above all&mdash;who, apart from other things, had suffered deadly
insult at his hands by the carrying away of the True Cross&mdash;hailed with
acclamations the parricide Kavadh, in whose elevation one of themselves
had played no small part.</p>

<h4>SUCCESSORS OF CHOSROES II</h4>

<p>The first thing that Kavadh (II) Seroes did was to murder all his brothers
(probably to the number of eighteen); the second was to send the emperor
an urgent entreaty for peace. A truce was quickly concluded, but no peace
as yet, Heraclius being in no hurry for it, since he was now to some extent
master of the situation. All Persian troops received orders to evacuate
Roman territory. Heraclius seems next to have introduced such order as
he could into the affairs of the provinces so recovered, and of Mesopotamia
in particular. On reaching Syria he learned that Kavadh Seroes was
already dead. The wretched man had only reigned for about half a year.
His reign was marked by a dreadful pestilence.</p>

<p>The party in power set his son Ardashir III, a child of seven, in his
place; and an epoch of unspeakable confusion ensued, in which the children
and women on the throne served only as a pretext for the ambitions of contesting
nobles. During Ardashir’s reign the cross, which had been sent
back from Ctesiphon to Heraclius through the head of the Nestorian church,
was solemnly set up again by him in Jerusalem. The festival of the Elevation
of the Cross on the 14th of September still keeps that joyful day in
remembrance (629).</p>

<p>The government at Ctesiphon was powerless. The Khazars invaded and
ravaged the empire. Possibly it was at this time that Chosroes, the son of
Kavadh and grandson of Hormuzd IV, who had grown to manhood among
the Turks, first tried to establish his throne in Khorasan. He was killed in a
few months, but a mightier than he, the victorious general Shahrbaraz,
grasped at the crown. In a personal interview at Arabissus in Cappadocia
(June, 629) he seems to have secured the assent of Heraclius, who must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
been deeply interested in weakening the hostile empire by fostering internecine
discord. Shahrbaraz then marched with a small force upon Ctesiphon,
and the famous defender of the empire took the city of its kings by
the treasonable aid of some of the principal inhabitants. The city was given
over to plunder, murder, and horrors of every kind; and the boy Ardashir
was slain on April 27, 630. But on the ninth of June, Shahrbaraz himself
fell a victim of the jealousy and legitimism of his compeers. His corpse was
dragged through the street; and tradition heaps grotesque irony on the man
who would be king and could not, because he was not of the legitimate line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[630-633 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A woman, Boran, the daughter of Chosroes II, was next raised to the
throne. She seems to have formally concluded peace with Heraclius at last;
on what terms we do not know, but probably the peace with Maurice was
simply ratified anew. At all events, Nisibis remained Persian.</p>

<p>Boran only reigned until about the autumn of 631. She was succeeded at
Ctesiphon, probably after the brief intermediate reign of a prince, Peroz by
name, by her sister Azarmidokht. At Nisibis, however, the troops of the
murdered Shahrbaraz set up Hormuzd V, a grandson of Chosroes II, who
held his ground in that district for some time (in the years 631 and 632).
Azarmidokht was overthrown by Rustem, the mighty hereditary crown-general
of Khorasan, whose father she had caused to be put to death. From
the confused accounts of this time of confusion we cannot gather with any
certainty who was king or who pretender in the capital or provinces, nor
determine the date or even the sequence of these “reigns.”</p>

<p>It is certain that after Azarmidokht one Ferrukhzadh (or Khorrezadh)
Chosroes was for some time accounted king at Ctesiphon. He was probably
a child, and according to some authorities was the only son of Chosroes II
who had escaped the general butchery. But others of the men in power set
up another child at Persis, Yezdegerd III, son of Shahriyar and grandson of
Chosroes II, and crowned him in the Fire temple of Ardashir (in the second
half of 632 or the first half of 633). He was presently acknowledged in the
capital, Chosroes having been put to death. No lasting resistance appears to
have been encountered in other provinces.</p>

<h4>ANARCHY AND CHAOS</h4>

<p>No one could now dream of a real restoration of the fearfully distracted
empire; but at least a grandson of Chosroes, who did not trace his descent
from the parricide Sheroe, was sole king once more. He was consecrated
at Istakhr, the home of the dynasty; and the mighty Rustem stood at his
side. A change for the better seems really to have ensued, but it was no
more than a brief respite. A foe destined to prove more formidable than
Julian or Heraclius was already knocking at the gates of the empire. In
the internal disorders which had distracted Ctesiphon, the loss of Yemen,
and a few of the empire’s possessions in northeastern Arabia to the Moslems,
had probably passed almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>The Moslems, however, were soon close at hand. The Bekr Bedouins
had made raids upon the royal dominions several times since the battle of
Dhu Kar. After a while Muthanna, one of their bravest chiefs, became a
convert to Islam, and with that force behind them their attacks grew bolder.
Then (probably in 633) the mighty Khalid, after subduing the insurrections
in Arabia, appeared with a small force on the lower Euphrates to conduct
the operations of these same Bedouins. Persian Arabs and imperial troops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
were defeated in small engagements, and soon a number of border forts
were in the hands of the Moslems. The inhabitants of the regions west of
the Euphrates, who were all Christians, and, like all the Christians about
the Euphrates and Tigris, felt little loyalty to the empire, submitted to the
victors and even undertook to supply them with information.</p>

<h4>ARAB INCURSIONS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[633-637 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Arabs were already beginning to rove on the far side of the Euphrates;
they plundered Baghdad, then a village, while a fair was being held
there, as well as other places on the right bank of the Tigris. But Khalid
presently received orders (the commencement of the summer of 634) to
start for Syria, the conquest of which was at the time a matter of greater
consequence to the caliph. His successor, Abu Obaid of Taif, brought
some reinforcements with him; but when at length a regular Persian army
came on the scene, the Moslems, in spite of their heroic valour, were completely
defeated in the “battle of the Bridge,” on the Euphrates, November
26th, 634. After their leader had fallen Muthanna had great difficulty in
extricating the remains of his army. Most of the Moslem conquests were
lost without further ado. After some hesitation Omar (caliph since August
23rd, 634) resolved to send more troops to Irak. He appealed simultaneously
to the greed and piety of the Arabs, urging them in the same breath to win
the treasures of Chosroes and the joys of paradise. A larger Persian army
was now defeated for the first time (at Buwaib, 635 or 636); the commander,
a member of the house of Mihran, was among the slain.</p>

<p>The Arabs were once more masters of the country west of the Euphrates.
They found an energetic and cautious leader in Saad, son of Abu
Wakkas, one of the first followers of the prophet. The lords at Ctesiphon
now realised the great danger that impended over the empire. The news of
the battle on the Yarmuk (August 20th, 636) which cost Heraclius, the conqueror
of Persia, the whole of Syria, probably contributed to their fears.
Rustem, therefore, took the head of a great army in person. As a token of
the gravity of the struggle he bore with him the sacred banner of the
empire (<i>dirafshi Kaviyan</i>), which was supposed to have come down from
time immemorial. He also took with him a number of elephants, according
to the Persian usage in war. At the approach of the advanced guard of
the Persian army Saad evacuated his position and retreated to Kadisiya, on the
verge of the desert (south or southwest of Hira). For months the armies
confronted one another, with only a little space between. The Arabic force
was certainly much the smaller of the two; they could not have fed a large
army in that place, for they were dependent on the produce of their raids
and such provisions as the caliph sent after them from Medina.</p>

<p>At length the great battle of Kadisiya (end of 636 or 637) was fought.
It lasted for several days; Saad was ill, but nevertheless took the command.
The Persians were, for the most part, much better armed than the Arabs,
but the courage of the latter was wound up to the highest pitch. They
were terrified by the elephants at first, but as they pressed on gallantly for
all their fears, the animals appear to have got beyond control and to have
become a source of confusion to the Persian ranks. The great majority of
the Persians certainly behaved with cowardice, after their ancient fashion;
but the Arabs had hard work before the foe was defeated, Rustem himself
slain, and the banner of the Persian Empire taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<h4>ARAB CONQUEST</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[637-652 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The battle of Kadisiya practically decided the fate of the provinces on
the Tigris. There were a few other fights, some of them in the vast territory
of ancient Babylon, but the Arabs soon afterwards reached Seleucia,
took it after a protracted siege, crossed the rapid stream of the Tigris, and
quickly forced their way into Ctesiphon. The young king Yezdegerd had
already fled to Holwan (on the border between Babylonia and Media). On
their way thither, at Jalula, the Arabs won another victory over the
Persians under Khorrezadh, Rustem’s brother, and Yezdegerd fled further
into the interior. Meanwhile other Arabs had conquered the delta of the
stream and thence advanced into Susiana. A very able resolute commander
might still have saved the actual land of Iran for the Persians. Omar, who
was very cautious in spite of his energy, was apprehensive lest the Arabs
should extend their forces too far, and at first would not give orders for an
advance into the highlands. At length he did so. A great Persian army
had been collected at Nehavend, a little to the south of the ancient highway
from Babylon to Ecbatana. Here a great battle was fought (in 640, 641, or
642), in which the Arabs&mdash;first under the command of Nohman and,
after he had fallen, under Hudhaifa the Meccan&mdash;won a brilliant victory.</p>

<p>With good reason the Moslems called the triumph of Nehavend the
“victory of victories.” It completely shattered the empire of Persia. The
Arabs had a long contest before them, until they had really conquered all
the provinces of the vast monarchy, but it consisted of isolated struggles in
which there could be no doubt of the ultimate issue, as their enemies had
lost all cohesion. Many towns and districts had to be subjugated again and
again, because they were constantly rebelling. The most obstinate resistance
appears to have been offered in Persia proper, especially about Istakhr,
the cradle of the empire of the Sassanidæ and the centre of its religion.
Many of the great provincial nobles and some of the lesser entered into
friendly agreement with the Arabs. They one and all met them on the
footing of independent sovereigns.</p>

<p>King Yezdegerd meanwhile led a wretched life. He could not summon
up courage to set his life on the stake for his crown and empire. He fled
from one satrap to another. He seems to have stayed longest at Istakhr,
the home of his race. The outward pomp of royalty was left him, coins
were still struck in his name, but as soon as he became a troublesome guest
he was sent away. At length he took refuge in the extreme northeast, and
there he was miserably murdered, in the neighbourhood of Merv. The circumstances
of his death, which took place in 651 or 652, are not exactly
known, but it seems tolerably certain that Mahoe, satrap of Merv, had a
hand in it. [For the traditional account see page 154, this volume.]</p>

<p>The similarity of the circumstances under which the Achæmenid and
Sassanid empires perished forces itself upon our notice, a similarity which,
though apparently fortuitous, indicates a great correspondence in character.
As the battle on the Granicus first fully showed the formidable nature of the
enemy, as Issus cost the king his western provinces and Gaugamela rent
the empire asunder without thereby making the victor master of all its
several provinces, so it came to pass nearly one thousand years later, with
the battles of Buwaib, Kadisiya, and Nehavend. And as the fugitive Darius
was slain, in the northeast, not by enemies but by treacherous nobles, so it was
with Yezdegerd, who was no more a hero than he. The Persian nobility
did not exhibit so gross a lack of patriotism and loyalty in the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Arabs as in that of Alexander; the vivid consciousness of religious differences
and the ruder manners of the Arabs made adherence to them more difficult;
but there was no lack of traitors of high rank nor of renegades among the
greater and lesser nobles. The complete subjugation of the Persian monarchy
took the Arabs much longer than it had taken the great Macedonian, but
on the other hand its effects were much more lasting; Hellenism touched
the mere surface of Persia, but Iran has been thoroughly permeated by Arab
religion and Arab characteristics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[652-750 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A fragment of the Sassanid empire continued to exist for some time
longer. The hereditary crown-generals (Shahpat, Ispehbedh) of Khorasan,
of the house of Karen, withdrew into the mountain country of Tabaristan
(Mazanderan) and there reigned for more than one hundred years, though
they occasionally found themselves under the necessity of paying tribute to
the caliph. They remained faithful to the religion of Zoroaster. The era
which they struck upon their coins begins, in all probability, with the death
of Yezdegerd, and they thus seemed to have looked upon themselves as the
direct succession of the last Sassanid king.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_2b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_2b">b</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III. EARLY HISTORY OF THE ARABS</h3>

<div class="sidenote">[<i>ca.</i> 2500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-622 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Arabian peninsula is Africa reduced in size and of more moderate
proportions, but without a river-valley like that of the Nile. The heart of
the country is a tableland, sparely watered under a burning sun, and forming
a depression in the midst of sandy deserts, rocky plains, peaks, and naked
cliffs. Thus, despite its great extent of over a million square miles, Arabia
presents, especially in the interior, but few stretches of land suitable for
cultivation. It is in the south, where the plateau slopes down to the Indian
Ocean in a series of declivities, that fertile valleys lie; and on the mountain
terraces, where cool winds from the ocean temper the tropic heat, the richest
fruits abound. This district of Arabia is the land of frankincense, of sugar-cane,
and coffee tree, of pomegranates, figs, dates, of maize, and wheat.</p>

<p>Herodotus,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3b1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3b">b</a></span> who like all other historians of antiquity applies the name
Arabia to regions lying even beyond Sinai and the Syrian deserts, gives us
but meagre information concerning the inhabitants of this vast land. “The
Arabs,” he says, “wear long garments, carry at their right side great bows
with double strings, and ride on swift camels. They worship two gods,
Dionysus whom they call Urotal, and Urania whom they call Alilat, the latter
also being called by the Babylonians Mylitta. Compacts are made in the
following manner; a third person cuts each of the parties to the agreement
in the hand near the thumb, and with the blood thus obtained smears seven
stones that lie on the ground between, at the same time calling on Urotal and
Alilat. Compacts thus sealed are held sacred by the Arabs, and are kept
with a fidelity rarely found in other nations.” Artemidorus<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3c">c</a></span> of Ephesus
calls Arabia rich in animals of all sorts; lions, panthers, wolves, wild asses,
and camels; and the inhabitants, according to him, were wandering herdsmen
who travelled about and did their fighting on the backs of camels, and
lived on the camels’ milk and flesh. He withholds from us the names of
these tribes on account of their obscurity and unmusical sound. Diodorus<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3d"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3d">d</a></span>
also tells us that parts of Arabia on the Syrian side were inhabited by tribes
who lived by trading and agriculture; but the tracts adjoining were for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
most part barren and without water, and the Nachabæans who occupied them
led the life of bandits, plundering their neighbours far and wide; no other
tribe had succeeded in conquering them. In the interior and in the west of
Arabia were sand plains of immense extent, across which it was only possible
to travel by taking, as on the sea, the Great Bear as a guide.</p>

<p>Pliny<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3e"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3e">e</a></span> remarks: “Wonderful to say, the Arabians live about equally by
robbery and by trade; what they obtain from their forests (meaning the
products of the date-palms and the fruit-trees of the south) and from the sea
they sell, yet they never buy anything in return.”</p>

<p>“The Arabs,” says Ammianus Marcellinus<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3f"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3f">f</a></span> “cover the territory that
reaches from the Euphrates to Egypt. They wear no clothing save a sort
of apron around the body, and a voluminous cloak. Every man among them
is a warrior, and on their camels and swift, fine-limbed horses they are everywhere
to be seen. They cannot endure to remain long in any one locality;
without permanent dwelling-place they wander restlessly about, and their
whole life is nothing but a flight. Of bread and wine the majority of Arabs
have never even heard.”</p>

<p>Different information is given us regarding the southern coast of Arabia.
Herodotus<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3b2"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3b">b</a></span> remarks that the greatest blessings are showered upon the extreme
limits of the earth, and that this seems to be true of Arabia, the most
southern point of the inhabited world. Here only in all the earth grow
frankincense, myrrh, cassia, and ladanum; here only are raised sheep with
tails so bushy that wagons have to be bound beneath them to support them.
But the trees bearing frankincense are guarded by winged serpents and
those bearing cassia by bats.</p>

<p>Thoroughly informed in matters relating to this district by reason of
Alexandria’s wide trade connections, Eratosthenes<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3g"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3g">g</a></span> could name the different
tribes that inhabited the south. “In the interior,” he adds, “were thick
forests formed by tall frankincense and myrrh trees; and besides these there
were cinnamon trees, palm and calmus, and other trees of a similar nature,
sending forth the sweetest odours. Out of so many it is not possible to
name every species; it is enough to say that the perfumes they diffused were
delicious beyond all words. Even people going by this land in ships at some
distance from the shore, have the odours wafted to them on the breeze. For
here the aroma does not proceed from spices old, stale, and laid away, but is
sent forth in full strength and freshness, so that sailors along the coast believe
they are enjoying ambrosia, no other name expressing the extraordinary
strength and richness of the perfume they inhale. Among the Sabæans
the monarchy is hereditary, and it is here that the king lives, dispensing
justice to the people, but never venturing to leave his palace. Should he
once show himself outside he would be stoned by his subjects, who would
thus be fulfilling an ancient oracle. The Sabæans are the richest people in
the world. In exchange for their few wares silver and gold flow in to them
from all sides, and owing to the remoteness of their situation no other tribe
has ever conquered them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">[<i>ca.</i> 2500-645 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>]</div>

<p>The Hebrew Scriptures have preserved for us information concerning the
populations of Arabia, that is older by a thousand years than that of Pliny,
and by five hundred than that of Herodotus. According to Genesis<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3h"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3h">h</a></span> the
tribes fall into four main groups; the Joktanites, among whom the tribes of
the south and east are the most prominent; the Keturites, which include
certain tribes of the east and northwest; the Ishmaelites, among whom can be
counted tribes of the north and of the tableland of the interior; and finally
the group of tribes who wandered and settled near the eastern frontiers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Canaan&mdash;the Amalekites, Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. The
Hebrews ascribe to the Arabs the same origin as their own.</p>

<p>From the genealogies it is plain that the Hebrews regarded the Arabian
tribes as close kinsmen of their own, and kinsmen of a far more ancient
branch. The Arabs of the south traced their origin back to the fifth generation
after Shem, the common forefather, while the Hebrews descended
from the second son of Isaac. Most closely related to them are the Ishmaelites,
who are divided into twelve tribes&mdash;the descendants of the sons of
Ishmael, the “twelve princes”; then follow the Edomites, the Ammonites,
and the Moabites.</p>

<p>The tradition of the Arabs scarcely goes back to the beginning of the
Christian era. What their writers, who began after Mohammed to tell
the early history of their race, knew of those ancient periods is either derived
from the accounts of the Hebrews, or is the work of pure imagination.
They represent the Amalekites, whom they found in Hebrew Scriptures, as
the founders of their race, and place their dwelling variously in Canaan and
Damascus, and the district of Mecca and Oman, and cause them at one time
to rule over Egypt. These Amalekites, the Tasmites and Jadi, Aadites
and Jorhomites, they look upon as the true Arabian stock, to whom God
taught Arabic after the confusion of tongues. But the Tasmites and Jadi
are as little to be accepted historically as Amalek, their names signifying
“the extinct,” and “the vanished”; the Aadites are a purely fabulous
people, and the Jorhomites (near Mecca) are a tribe of by no means
ancient origin. The progenitor of the tribes of Yemen in the south is,
according to the Arabians, Kahtan, the son of Eber, and great-grandson of
Noah; this is the Joktan of Genesis. This founder of the Sabæan monarchy
left two sons, Himyar and Kahtan. Himyar was the progenitor of the
Himyarites, and their abode is placed on the southern coast of Arabia,
between Mareb (Saba) and Hadramaut.</p>

<p>To the kingdom of Mareb, founded by Abd Shams-Sabah, is ascribed by
Arab tradition a long succession of rulers. But even if we were to allow
to each name a reign of more than thirty years, Kahtan’s period would not
be carried back beyond 700 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Abd Shams-Sabah is supposed to have
built not only Mareb but a great dam for the irrigation of the land. The
well-built dams, canals, and sluices at Sana (the Uzal of the Hebrews, to
the west of Mareb) are said to have been erected by Asad. The castles of
Sahlin and Bainun (near Sana) were built by dæmons, at Solomon’s bidding,
for Belkis, queen of Sheba. Towards the end of the year 700 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> Harith,
at the head of the Himyarites, gained possession of the kingdom of the
Sabæans, who were thus driven from their own land, and the Himyarites who
supplanted them (the Homerites of western nations) became the ruling people
in Yemen. Arab tradition had somewhat prepared the way for this change
by making Himyar the oldest son and successor of Abd Shams-Sabah.</p>

<p>If we trace the genealogies given by Arab tradition to the rulers of the
tribes descended from Ishmael backwards for twenty generations till we
reach Adnan, his grandson, we do not arrive at an earlier period than the
second century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, even if we allow thirty years for each generation.</p>

<p>There have been handed down to us no consistent accounts of these
people. We learn that Egypt, at some period later than 3000 years <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
gained a foothold in the west of the Sinai peninsula, but we are unable to
obtain any certainty of the origin of the invading tribes. The inscriptions
of Egypt of the time of Tehutimes and the first Ramses,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3i"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3i">i</a></span> tell of victories
achieved over the Shasu and over the Punt, that is, the Arabs; but we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
learn the extent of these victorious operations, nor the names of the
tribes against which they were directed, hence we conclude that they were
of but a transitory nature. The Hebrews relate that the queen of the Sabæans,
ruler over that fruitful, spice-bearing land, journeyed to Jerusalem to
lay before King Solomon rich presents of spices and gold.</p>

<p>It would surprise us to learn that an Arabian monarchy was in the hands
of a woman, did not the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3j"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3j">j</a></span> reveal that even
the tribes of the deserts frequently had women as rulers. These same inscriptions
also furnish us with information concerning certain early Arabian
tribes, and make known to us their great wealth in cattle. The third Tiglathpileser
relates that in the year 735 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> he received tribute from Zabibieh,
queen of Arabia (Aribi). In the year 734 he marched on Samshi, queen of
Arabia, and took from her as spoils thirty thousand camels and twenty thousand
oxen, afterwards subjugating the people of Saba, the Sabæan city. King
Sargon makes boast that he conquered the people of Thamud, the Thamudenes
of western writers; also those of Tasid, Ibadid, Marsiman, Chayapa, the
distant Arbæans, the inhabitants of the lands of Bari, “which the learned
and the scribes knew not,” and that Samshi, queen of the Arabs and Yathamic,
the Sabæan, paid him tribute of spices, camels, and gold (715 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). Sennacherib
took from the Pecod, the Hagarites, the Nabatæans, and certain
other tribes, 5330 camels, and 800,600 head of small cattle (703 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). During
the reign of Asshurbanapal, Adija, queen of the Arabs, and Ammuladin,
king of the Kedarites, were conquered and brought in chains to Nineveh;
and the “innumerable warriors” of another prince, Yauta-ben-Bir-Dadda,
were put to rout and his tents were burned. A third chief, Abiyate, with
his allies, Yauta-ben-Hazael, Natnu (Nathan) king of the Nabatæans, and
the worshippers of Istar, was defeated in 645 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The position of Arabia between the river valleys of the Nile, the Euphrates,
and the Tigris, which had been the seats of the oldest industries and
where agriculture and civilisation had early begun to flourish, brought the
Arabs, who were continually wandering about the frontiers of their land,
into close connection with Egypt and Babylon. What robbery failed to
supply could be obtained by barter. The wandering herdsmen had need of
corn, tools, and weapons; the Egyptians and Babylonians, of horses, camels,
skins, and wool. By giving in exchange for what they required cattle
and skins, the Arabs kept the Egyptians and Babylonians supplied with raw
materials for their industries. According to Hebrew tradition Abraham went
into Egypt, and the sons of Jacob bought grain in Egypt when “there was a
famine in the land.” The fact that the Egyptians gained possession, in 3000
<span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, of the valley of Maghara in the Sinai peninsula, and that a thousand
years later certain nomad tribes of the northwest of Arabia obtained supremacy
over Egypt, served but to strengthen the later relations between the two
countries. That there had long been intercourse is certain; and contact
with the superior culture of Egypt had so multiplied the wants of the Arabs
as greatly to increase their trading relations. They could offer not alone
their cattle to the Egyptians in barter but the costly products of their southern
coasts, the frankincense and perfumes that had already attained a high
celebrity in Egypt as early as 2500 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It is no wonder then, in view of this ancient and active trade, that Queen
Ramaka (Maat-ka-Ra or Hatshepsu) of Egypt made the attempt to import the
products of southern Arabia direct by way of the Red Sea; and it must have
been this same intention that caused Ramses II to project a canal that should
connect the Nile with the Red Sea. Later, Ramses III caused ships to be built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
especially for the trade with “the land of Punt” (Arabia) and “the land of
the gods” (the far East). Great as was the demand of Egypt for incense
and perfumes, that of Babylon seems to have been no less. Herodotus<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3b3"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3b">b</a></span> tells
us that at the annual feast of Belos a thousand talents of incense was burned
on the altar of the great Babylonian temple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[<i>ca.</i> 1225 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-100 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The demand for Arabian products must have greatly increased when the
Phœnician cities planted along the coast of Syria, grew to be important trade
centres.</p>

<p>That the Babylonian talent was current among the Sabæans is evidence
of the extent and activity of Babylonian trade. First passing their goods from
one to another of their own tribes until the market at Damascus was reached,
or the Euphrates and the Nile for shipping, the
Arabs permitted or refused passage to the caravans
of the Babylonians and the Phœnicians. They
lay in wait for the merchant-trains, and either
plundered them or forced them to pay for safe
passage and convoy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p104.jpg" width="150" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Arab Archer</span></p>
</div>

<p>The beauty and fertility of the portion of
Arabia occupied by the Sabæans and the Chatramites
must have early served to fix them there as
permanent settlers, and their constantly growing
commerce with Egypt, Syria, and Babylonia unquestionably
resulted in a great influx of wealth
to these tribes. Thus even the tales current
among western nations of the splendour of their
cities&mdash;the sixty temples of Sabbatha, and the
gold and silver vessels, pillars, and couches of
Mareb&mdash;must have had strong foundation in fact.
Ruins of mighty aqueducts, dams, and basins
remain, which are the wonder and admiration of
our tourists for the excellence of their plan and
the solidity of their construction. They reveal
to us not only the skill of the ancient Sabæans
and Chatramites in erecting important works, but
their complete understanding of the subject of
irrigation; since the whole system of canals and
basins was evidently designed to utilise upon
their own lands the streams rushing down from
the mountains. Remains of magnificent structures,
not alone near Mareb but near Nejran,
Ghorab, Nakb-el-Hajara, go far towards confirming
what western and Arab tradition tell us of the glories of ancient
times; and inscriptions on these and other ruins in the southwest of Yemen
give us, though they do not go back further than the year 120 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, an insight
into the life and culture of the tribes of South Arabia. We also learn the
earlier forms of their spoken and written language, and discover that their
alphabet was derived from that of the Phœnicians, developing later independently
side by side with it. Of a more recent date (the first century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)
are inscriptions on the rocks of the Sinai peninsula in the extreme northwest
of Arabia, which are written in the north Arabian language and characters.</p>

<p>A glance at the meagre array of facts made known to us reveals the basis
of the religious conceptions of the Semitic tribes in Arabia to be almost the
same as that of the Semitic tribes in Syria, or those by the Euphrates and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Tigris. It can readily be believed that the rites of those tribes nearest Syria
partake somewhat of the character of the Syrian rites and that the worship
of the southern tribes is closely allied to that of the Babylonians.</p>

<p>That the tribes of the desert should pay particular reverence to the stars
cannot occasion much wonder. With the refreshing dews of night came not
only Venus and the moon but the entire splendour of the firmament, to dazzle
the eye and touch the spirit of the Arab. High above the silent desert, the
tents, and sleeping flocks, looking down on the midnight ride and the waiting
ambuscade, the stars swung on their glittering way. They were the
source of a varied knowledge to the Arab; they marked out his path through
the trackless desert, foretold the coming of the rain for which he had prayed,
indicated the change of the seasons and the time for breeding in his flocks.
Since these stars could at one time provide good pasturage and all that was
needful for flocks, and at another dry up the wells and grass, why could they
not also bring joy and pain, happiness and sorrow to mankind? Thus to the
tribes of the desert the stars that shone brightest became living spirits, that
ruled supreme over nature and the destinies of men.</p>

<p>The life of the nomad tribes of the interior (included by the Arabs
under one name, Badawi [Bedouins] “children of the desert”) has suffered
but few changes; up to the present day there have been no very radical
departures from the customs and conditions of the olden time, which are
fully described elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the Arabs the qualities peculiar to the Semitic character have attained
their soundest and most strongly marked development. Their wandering
life in the desert, exposed to burning sun and tempests of wind and sand,
has steeled and strengthened them. In a land of trackless wastes, surrounded
by beasts of prey and hostile tribes, each man was dependent for
safety on his own watchfulness and keenness of vision, on his own courage
and resolution, on his horse and lance. Soberly and frugally nourished, the
body became lean and spare, but supple, sinewy, and capable of great
endurance, and within these hardened frames dwelt a spirit of indomitable
resolution. Thus the Arabs are characterised by a freer bearing, a more
steadfast good faith, a more umbrageous pride, a greater love of independence,
and a bolder daring than any other tribes of their race. The nature of
their country and of their life has saved them from the excesses of greed
of luxury and sensuality into which the Semitic populations on the Euphrates
and the Tigris, as well as those on the Mediterranean, frequently fell,
though they share in the cruelty and blood-thirstiness common to their
race. It was the Arabs on whose unused strength it was possible to found
an empire, a new Semitic civilisation in the Middle Ages, after Babel and
Asshur, Tyre and Carthage, Jerusalem and Palmyra, had long passed away.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3k"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3k">k</a></span></p>

<h4>ARAB HISTORY BEFORE MOHAMMED</h4>

<p>The history of Arabia and its inhabitants naturally divides itself into
two distinct and even dissimilar periods, that, namely, which preceded the
era of Mohammed, and that which followed it. Each of these two periods,
though comprising in its extent several minor phases and fluctuations, now
of advance, now of retrogression, bears, however, a well-marked general
character of its own. The first of the two periods is distinguished as one of
local monarchies and federal governments; the latter commences with theocratic
centralisation dissolving into general anarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>The first dawning gleams of anything that deserves to be called history
disclose Arabia wholly, or nearly so, under the rule of a race of southern
origin; the genuine, or, as they are sometimes termed from a mythical
ancestor Kahtan, the Kahtanee Arabs. These, again, we find subdivided
into several aristocratic monarchical governments, arranged so as to form a
broad framework or rim around the central wilds of the peninsula.</p>

<p>Oldest and chiefest among the Arab monarchies was that of Yemen;
its regal residence is said to have been in the now abandoned town of Mareb,
in the extreme south. After a devastating inundation, referred with some
probability to the first century of the Christian era, the seat of government
was removed from the ruins of Mareb to Sana, a city which has continued
the metropolis of Yemen to the present day. The Yemenite kings, descendants
of Kahtan and Himyar (the dusky), a name denoting African origin,
and each adorned with the reiterated surname of “Tobba,” a word of
African etymology, and signifying “powerful,” are said to have reigned,
with a few dynastic interruptions and palace revolutions, for about
twenty-five hundred years, during which long period they commanded the
direct obedience of the entire southern half of the peninsula; while, by their
tribute-collectors, and by chiefs of kindred or delegated authority, they
indirectly governed the northern. One of these monarchs is asserted, though
historical criticism will hardly admit the assertion for fact, to have subdued
the whole of central Asia, and even to have reached the boundaries of China;
while another anticipated, so runs the story, the later and more authentic
conquests of his race on the north African continent. In both these cases
Arab chroniclers seem to have appropriated for their own rulers, not without
some additional exaggerations, the glories and exploits of the Egyptian
kings. But that theirs was a vigorous and in some respects a civilised government
is attested alike by the literary and the architectural relics of their
time. Their sovereignty was at last overthrown, 529 (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) by an Abyssinian
invasion, and was re-established in 603 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> as a dependency of the Persian
Empire, till in the year 634 it was finally absorbed by Mohammedan conquest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[100-500 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Next in importance to the kingdom of Yemen came the subsidiary
monarchy of Hira, or more correctly Heerah, situated in the northeasterly
province of Arabian Irak. Its kings, a collateral branch of the royal race
of Sana, governed the western shore of the lower Euphrates, from the
neighbourhood of Babylon down to the confines of Nejd, and along the coast
of the Persian Gulf. The duration of their empire, founded in the second
century after Christ, was 424 years. This kingdom paid an uncertain
allegiance to their more powerful neighbours, the Persian despots; and
from time to time exercised considerable influence over the turbulent tribes
of central Arabia, till, like Yemen, it sank before the rising fortunes of
Mohammed and his followers.</p>

<p>A third monarchy, that of Ghassan, lorded it on the northwest over lower
Syria and the Hedjaz; its independence was somewhat tempered with unequal
alliances with the Roman, and subsequently the Byzantine Empire. It was
founded in the first century of the Christian era, shortly after the flood of
Mareb; and its duration, till subdued by the all-conquering prophet, exceeded
six hundred years.</p>

<p>A fourth government, that of Kindeh, detached itself from Irak early in
the fifth century, and united under its sceptre the tribes of northerly Nejd
and even those of Oman, for about 160 years. Its kings were, like those
before mentioned, of Yemenite origin; but their rule was weak and disturbed
by frequent wars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>Much has been written by Arab authors regarding the great inundation, as
they term it, of Arem or Mareb, possibly a tropical cyclone of more than ordinary
destructiveness, like that of 1867 in the West Indies; and this event
they love to assign as the proximate cause which dispersed the families of
Yemen over northern Arabia, and led to the foundation of the kingdoms
of Irak and Ghassan. But the reality of the events, physical or political,
symbolised by the “flood of Arem” (a counterpart, after its fashion, of the
biblical flood) cannot now be well deciphered.</p>

<p>This is however certain&mdash;in that the Yemenite Arabs, and especially those
who tenanted the south of the peninsula, had, during the period now cursorily
sketched, attained a very fair degree of civilisation&mdash;that arts and commerce
flourished, that wealth was accumulated, literature cultivated, and
talent held in esteem. On all these points we have not only the uncertain
and distorted testimony of foreign authors, such as Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus,
Ptolemy, and the like, but the more positive though fragmentary evidence
afforded by the national writings, chiefly verse, that have survived to our
day. In its general character and institutions the kingdom of Yemen seems
to have borne a considerable resemblance to the neighbouring one of the
Nile valley, on the other side of the Red Sea, and, like it, to have reached at
a very early epoch a relatively high degree of prosperity and social culture,
from which, however, it had long declined before its final extinction in the
seventh century. But the daughter-kingdom of Hira had, as was natural,
something of a Persian tinge; while that of Ghassan took a more Byzantine
colouring. Lastly, the nomadic element predominated in the ill-cemented
monarchy of Kindeh.</p>

<p>But while the sceptre of Yemen was yet, in one form or other, outstretched
over the length and breadth of the land, and its children, the genuine
or African Arabs, formed a complete and dense circle of population all
around, the centre of Arabia remained the stronghold of a different though
kindred race, in their mode of living wild and ferocious; less susceptible of
culture, but gifted with greater energy and concentration of purpose than
their southern cousins. The latest recorded emigration of this branch
of the Arab stock had been not from the south but the north; and instead of
the mythical Kahtan, they claimed a no less mythical Adnan, or his supposed
grandson Nezar, for their ancestor; their language, though radically identical
with that spoken by the genuine Arabs, was yet dialectically different
in several respects, and nearer to the Syriac or Hebrew. Lastly, unlike the
Arabs from the south, they had little disposition for agriculture, and even
less for architecture and the fine arts; their instincts leading them to a
pastoral and consequently a nomadic life. The almost infinite ramifications
of these “Mustareb” or “adscititious Arab” tribes lead ultimately up to five
principal stocks. These were Rabiah, which, however, laid some claim to a
Yemenite kinsmanship in the east centre of the peninsula; Koreish, on the
west; Kais, or Kais-Ailan, and Hawazin, on the north; and Tamin in
the middle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[500-570 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>History has left unrecorded the exact date of their arrival in Arabia; nor
has she defined the period during which they remained tributaries, though
often refractory, of the kings of Yemen. But in the fifth century of the
Christian era there appeared among the Mustareb tribes a leader of extraordinary
talent and energy named Kolaib, sprung from the tribe of Rabiah,
who having, in the fashion of William Tell, slain with his own hand the
insolent and licentious tax-gatherer sent them from Sana, raised the banner
of general revolt in Nejd; and, in the battle of Hazat (500 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), broke forever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the bonds of Yemen from off the neck of the northern Arabs. This done,
Kolaib aspired to unite his countrymen into one vast confederacy, over which
he himself exercised for a time an almost kingly power; but the scheme
was prematurely broken off by his own assassination. Left now without a
master, but also without a ruler, the Mustareb tribes found themselves involved
in a series of wars that lasted during the whole of the sixth century, their
heroic period. Yet in spite of severe losses sustained in battle by this or
that particular clan, their power as a whole went on increasing, till at the
dawn of the seventh century they had wholly absorbed the feeble kingdom
of Kindeh, and encroached yearly more and more on the narrowing bounds of
Yemen, Irak, and Ghassan.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p108.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Arab Chief</span></p>
</div>

<p>Nor, probably, would they have stayed till they had become absolute
lords over the whole, or nearly the whole, of the peninsula, had there not
developed itself from among themselves a still more energetic element which,
before many years had passed, reduced
both northern and southern Arabs alike
to common obedience, then raised them
to an unexpected height of common glory,
and at last plunged them, along with
itself, into one comprehensive decline and
ruin. This new and potent element was
the well-known clan of Fihr or Koreish.
Its families, of Mustareb descent, had at
an early period, which subsequent and
Mohammedan chroniclers have tried to
identify with the fortunes of the mythical
Ismail, established themselves in the
southerly Hedjaz, near the town of Mecca,
a locality even then the principal religious
and commercial centre of Arabia.
Already, at the beginning of the fifth
century, the chiefs of Koreish had, by a
mixture of violence and craft very characteristic
of their race, rendered themselves
the masters and the acknowledged guardians
of the sacred “Kaaba.” This square
stone temple, or rather shrine, itself of unknown antiquity, was situated
within the precincts of the town of Mecca; and to it the Arabs were in
the habit of bringing yearly offerings, and of making devout pilgrimages,
for centuries before Mohammed had adopted it into the new ritual of Islam
as the house of the true God. The keys of the consecrated building had originally
been in possession of delegates appointed by the monarch of Yemen;
but the Koreish Arabs, having once obtained them, held them fast forever
after, and successfully repelled every effort, both of their own pagan competitors
and of the invading Christian Abyssinians (570 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), to recapture
or to seize them. Their possession of the temple keys not only gave the
tribe of Koreish a semi-religious pre-eminence over all the other clans of
Arabia, but also placed at their disposal the treasures of gold, silver, jewels,
and other offerings accumulated by the pagan piety of ages in the temple of
Mecca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[500-600 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A more important, as also a more creditable, source of wealth to the
Koreish clan was their Red Sea coast traffic, particularly with the ports of
Yemen and Abyssinia. Jiddah has been always the chief westerly seaport,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
and Mecca, which is only a few leagues distant, the principal inland emporium,
of Arab trade; and under the dominating influence of the clever
and active merchants of Koreish, both places acquired special prosperity and
importance.</p>

<p>Lastly, only a day’s journey distant from Mecca, was held, in the pre-Islamitic
times, the great yearly fair and gathering of Okad, so called from
the name of the plain where it used to assemble&mdash;a national meeting, frequented
by men of all conditions, from all quarters of the Arab peninsula,
and lasting through the entire month of Dhul-kaadeh, which in pagan, as
subsequently in Mohammedan reckoning, immediately preceded the ceremonies
of the annual pilgrimage. Here horse races, athletic games, poetical
recitals, and every kind of public amusement, diversified the more serious
commercial transactions of an open fair, that, in its comprehensiveness,
almost assumed the proportions of a national exhibition. Here, too, matters
of the highest import, questions of peace and war, of treaty and alliance,
of justice and revenge, were habitually treated by the chiefs of the northern
Arabs; the “children of Mezar,” to give them their favourite Mustareb
patronymic, assembled in a sort of amphictyonic council, not less ancient,
but while it lasted much more influential throughout Arabia, than that of
Thebes ever had been in classic Greece. In this assembly the immediate
local proximity of the Koreish chiefs, joined to their personal wealth, courage,
and address, assigned them a predominant position.</p>

<p>Of their pedigree, which, as is well known, includes that of Mohammed
himself, we have a carefully (too carefully, indeed, for authenticity) constructed
chronicle, bringing the family tree up in due form to Ishmael, the
son of Abraham, of whom the Koreish figure as the direct descendants. In
the same artificial annals the Yemenite, or genuine Arabs, appear under the
cousinly character of the children of Joktan, the son of Eber. On these
points all Mohammedan annalists are equally positive and distinct; all other
Arab testimony is equally adverse or silent. That a fable so utterly defiant
of reasonable chronology, and even of the common sense of history itself,
should have been adopted as matter of fact by Arab vanity and ignorance,
is less surprising than that it should have found favour in the eyes of not a
few, indeed of most, of our own European writers. Enough here to say that
Mohammedan chroniclers, by adopting as irrefragable historical authority
the Jewish records, and then retouching them here and there in accordance
with their own special predictions and tenets, have succeeded in concealing
the truth of their own national identity and story from themselves and even
from others, under an almost hopeless incrustation of childish fiction.</p>

<p>To sum up, at the opening of the seventh century of our era, and coincidently
with the first appearance of the prophetic autocrat and destined
remodeller of Arabia, the overteeming life and energy of the great peninsula
was, broadly taken, thus divided: Foremost stood the tribe of Koreish, with
their allies, a powerful confederacy composed of tribes belonging to the Mustareb
or northern stock, and occupying the upper half of the westerly coast
and region. Next in importance came the countless independent, and, thus
far, uncentralised clans of the centre of the peninsula; they, too, are mostly
of Mustareb origin; though a few claimed the more ancient and aristocratic
kinsmanship of Yemen, but without, however, paying any allegiance to its
rulers. Lastly, to the south, east, and north, still existed the noble but
enfeebled relics of the old Yemenite kingdoms of Sana, Hira, and Ghassan,
half-sunk into Persian or Byzantine vassalage, and exerting little authority,
even within their own ancestral limits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[25 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>-632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But, however important to the country itself and in their ultimate results
to the world at large might be the events that took place within Arabia during
the pre-Islamitic epoch, they had small bearing on the nations outside the
peninsula. The Yemenite queen of Sheba’s ambassage to Solomon, even if an
historical event, led at least to no historical results; and with other coeval
rulers and nationalities, Greek, Persian, and Macedonian, the Arabs rarely
came into any other contact than that of distant and desultory traffic.
Nor do the frontier skirmishes by which an Antigonus or a Ptolemy attempted,
without success, to gain a footing in Arabia, deserve more than
a passing notice; and Pompey himself, victorious elsewhere, was foiled on
its frontiers.</p>

<p>At last during the reign of Augustus, Ælius Gallus, the Roman prefect
of Egypt, undertook a military expedition against Yemen itself, with the
view of annexing that region, which report enriched with immense treasures,
to the Roman Empire. With an army composed of ten thousand Roman
infantry, five hundred Jews, and one thousand Nabatæans, he crossed the
Red Sea in two hundred and ten galleys, and landed at Moilah, or Leuce
Come, in 25° N. lat., near the modern Yambo. After some delay, the consequence
of disease and disorganisation among his troops, he marched southward
until he reached the inland district and city of Nejran, on the nearer
frontier of Yemen. The town of Nejran he is said to have taken by assault,
as well as a few neighbouring places, probably mere villages, of little note.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a large force of Arabs had assembled to oppose him, but Gallus
easily defeated them, and advanced to Mareb itself, then, we may suppose,
the capital of Yemen. But the Roman soldiers, unaccustomed to the heat
of the tropical climate, and much reduced in numbers, were incapable of laying
siege to that town; and their general thus found himself forced to retreat,
and recrossed the sea to Egypt without having effected any permanent settlement
on the Arab side. Later attempts, made by Roman governors or
generals under Trajan and Severus, were restricted to the neighbourhood of
the Assyrian frontier; and the ruined cities of Bosrah and Petra yet indicate
the landmarks of the extreme southerly limits reached by imperial
dominion over Arab territory.</p>

<p>More serious, and more lasting in its consequences, was the great Abyssinian
invasion of Yemen in 529, when Aryat, son or lieutenant of the king
of Abyssinia, landed in Aden with an army of seventy thousand men, to
avenge his co-religionists, the Christians, who had been cruelly persecuted
by Dhu-Nowas, king of Yemen, himself a proselyte to and an ardent propagator
of the Jewish code. The expedition was successful; Dhu-Nowas
perished, Christianity was proclaimed, and for seventy-six years the Ethiopian
conquerors retained subject to their rule the southern and richer half
of the peninsula. Their king Abraha even advanced, in 570 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> (the
year of the birth of Mohammed) as far as Mecca; but beneath its walls suffered
a repulse, which has been magnified by the <i>Koran</i> and Mohammedan
tradition into the proportions of a miracle. Persian assistance, furnished
by the great Chosroes, ultimately enabled the Arabs under Seif, son of
Yezen, last direct lineal descendant of the old kings of Sana, to liberate
their territory from its dusky usurpers (605 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>).</p>

<p>The seventh century had now commenced, and before long the wonderful
successes of Mohammed (622-632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), while they closed in one great centralising
effort the era of Arab progress and development within the land,
opened a marvellous phase of new activity and almost boundless extension
without.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_3l"><a href="#parthians_endnote_3l">l</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mohammed ben Abdallah ben Abdul-Muttalib</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">[570-632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>While the poets in their stories were moulding the language to a more
uniform character, another work was going on in men’s minds which contributed
to found Arab nationality in a more decisive manner; there was no
more belief in the idols which had, at an early date, taken the place of the
one God, Allah; religious sentiment burst out on every side. Already wide
schisms were apparent; entire tribes had abandoned the former worship.
Besides idolatry, several religions were to be found in Arabia. The Jews,
driven from their country by the Assyrians, the Romans, and the Greeks,
had been warmly welcomed by the children of Ishmael, who found in the
traditions of the exiles a deep respect for the God of Abraham; by means of
these souvenirs skilfully evoked, Judaism had made converts. It was principally
seen spread throughout Hedjaz, in the neighbourhood of Khaibar and
Yathreb, where powerful tribes, those of the Koraizas and the Nadhirites, had
long been naturalised. A large portion of the tribes of Yemen had also
adopted it; and some of the Tobbas had favoured the introduction of the
faith of Moses into their states, principally towards the years 225, 310, and
495 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Sabaism or magianism was also practised by the Himyarites
and on the coast of the Persian Gulf; some disciples of Brahmanism were
even to be found in the midst of the inhabitants of Oman.</p>

<h4>RELIGIOUS UNREST</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[520-580 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Christianity, successfully preached in several parts of Arabia, was professed
by the Ghassanides in the year 330, and by various Arab tribes of
Irak, Mesopotamia, Bahrein, the desert of Faran, and Damut-Jandal. The
combined efforts of the negus of Abyssinia and of the emperor of Constantinople
had contributed to spread the Gospel in Yemen. The Christian colony
of Nejran had been honoured by persecution under Dhu-Nowas towards
523; fifty years later, Abraha sought to make of the church of Sana the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
goal of Arab pilgrimages. Lastly several kings of Hira had been favourable
to the religion of Christ.</p>

<p>In the midst of the new ideas which preaching had spread throughout
the peninsula, idolatry nevertheless remained the dominant religion. The
intermediary divinities which certain tribes adored bore no resemblance to
those creations of the Greeks and Romans, who worshipped moral beings
clothed in bodily forms; they were, as with the ancient Egyptians, animals
and plants, the gazelle, the horse, the camel, palm trees, vegetables, or inorganic
bodies, rocks, stones, etc. All the Arabs acknowledged one supreme
God, Allah; but some of them worshipped under the figure of their idols,
the angels Benat-allah (the daughters of God); others, the planets or stars
such as Aldebaran, Sirius, Canope, etc. They believed in genii, <i>Jinn</i>, in
ogres, <i>Ghol</i>, in witchcraft, <i>Shir</i>, in divination, <i>Kehana</i>, in sacrifices, in oracles;
fate was consulted by means of arrows without points, <i>kidah</i> or <i>azlam</i>, and
the most blamable superstitious rites were still almost universally practised.
A great number of tribes had their special idols, Hobal, Lat, etc., who were
honoured by rich offerings, and in whose honour victims were slain; however,
no temple had the fame of the Kaaba, whose pre-eminence was universally
admitted.</p>

<p>This temple, which Abraha al-Ashram had wished to destroy, had been
throughout the ages the object of the greatest veneration; it was looked on
as a present made by Jehovah to the Arab race to bear witness to its condition
privileged beyond all others. It was the oratory of Abraham and of Ishmael,
the house of Allah; on receiving the 360 idols, subordinate powers accepted
by the Arabs, it included all their divinities and became the Pantheon of the
nation; the traditions connected with it were dear to all. They made
the Kaaba a place of pilgrimage. They laboured to adorn it, to beautify it;
they would have liked it to surpass in riches all the monuments of the universe;
they hung the <i>Moallakat</i> in it, as if to connect with it every form of
illustration. The Sabians, the fire-worshippers, sent their offerings to it;
even the Jews showed a deep respect for this revered spot. The guardians
of the temple, the Koreish clan, had a sort of religious authority which was
willingly recognised by all; for instance, they had the right to name the
sacred months during which, after the pilgrimage, a suspension of arms
should reign throughout Arabia. So those who could attend the fair of
Okad placed their weapons in the hands of the Koreish chiefs before entering
the meeting, which, without this wise precaution, would often have degenerated
into bloody fights. It was therefore necessary to have influence at
Mecca and with the Koreish chiefs if one wished to found a uniform and
national religion in Arabia, and Mohammed saw this perfectly.</p>

<p>Abdul-Muttalib, the son of Hashim, born in 497, exercised supreme
authority in Mecca, from 520 to 579; he had the glory of delivering his
country from the invasion of the Abyssinians, and he saw a Himyarite
prince drive the foreigners from Yemen with the help of the king of
Persia. Father of eighteen children, he believed himself bound by a rash
vow to sacrifice one of his sons, in 569, before the idols of the Kaaba;
fate fixed on one he loved the most, Abdallah, about twenty-four years of
age. At the moment of the sacrifice, some of the Koreish chiefs rose against
so barbarous an action and so fatal an example; by their advice a witch,
<i>arrafa</i>, was consulted, who declared that Abdallah’s life might be purchased
by means of the <i>dia</i> (price of human blood), and by drawing lots. The <i>dia</i>
consisting of ten camels, the number ten was inscribed on a pointless arrow,
and on another the name of Abdallah; nine times the name of Abdallah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
appeared, and it was only the tenth time that the camels were condemned.
So a hundred were killed instead of Abdallah, and this number became
thenceforth among the Koreish chiefs the price of the <i>dia</i>.</p>

<p>A few days later Abdallah married Amina, daughter of Wahb, chief of
the family of the Zohri, and from this marriage was born Mohammed, “the
glorified,” about the month of August, 570.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mohammed’s Life</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">[570-595 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Mohammed (properly Muhammad, “the much praised”; and not Mahomet),
was born in Mecca five years after the death of Justinian. The
small inheritance which his father left him consisted of five camels and a
faithful female slave. The biographers inform us that according to the
custom which prevailed among the upper classes in Mecca, his mother
Amina put the child out to nurse in the country. Halima, the wife of a
herdsman, was his foster-mother and nurse till his third year, and the
sacred legend tells us of many wonders with which the divine favour surrounded
Mohammed’s childhood. Halima’s flocks and herds increased tenfold;
her fields bore a superabundant harvest; angels cleansed the child’s
heart from all sins and filled it with faith, knowledge and prophetic gifts.
As, however, the child suffered from fits of convulsions, at the end of two
years Halima brought him back to his mother. With her he remained till
his sixth year. She then went with him to Yathreb (Medina), to visit her
relatives, but died on the way back in the town of Abwa.</p>

<p>Mohammed now entered the house of his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib,
and when two years later the latter also died, his uncle Abu Talib took him
into his family and watched over him with paternal affection. The story
that in his twelfth year he accompanied his foster-father on a caravan journey
to Syria, and that on this occasion a Christian monk foretold the boy’s
future greatness, appears, like many other details of his life, to be a later
legend. As he grew older, after having spent some time in guarding the
flocks, Mohammed took his share in the business and manner of life of his
relatives. He accompanied several of his uncles on warlike and commercial
expeditions, in which he learned to know his country and his nation, and
beheld the desert with its terrors and its poetry, where he heard the legends
and traditions of the wandering tribes and gathered information concerning
the teachings of the beliefs of Jew and Christian. He did not himself understand
the language of writing, but Mecca as the pilgrim city of the East
was one of the world’s centres, a school of culture containing much instruction
for a thoughtful youth. The Christian religion, indeed, appears to have
been known to him only by a few legends and distorted doctrines; but on
the other hand the Jewish sect of the Hanifs, who lived scattered over the
oases of the desert, had preserved and handed down Judaism in its original
purity and simplicity, together with the belief in divine revelations at the
mouth of inspired prophets.</p>

<h4>HIS MARRIAGE WITH KHADIJA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[595-612 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In his twenty-fifth year Khadija, the wealthy widow of a merchant, who
like himself was descended from Kussai, intrusted him with the conduct
of some caravans going to Syria and southern Arabia. In the execution of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
these commissions Mohammed showed so much circumspection, skill, and
honesty, that Khadija though already forty years old permitted him to make
application for her hand. The wedding was solemnly performed and it
founded Mohammed’s fortune. Khadija was an intelligent and virtuous
woman, and a faithful companion to her husband in good and evil days.
“She was his first convert, she comforted him when he was mocked, she
encouraged him when he suffered under persecution, she strengthened him
when he was wavering.” But for the love and faith of Khadija, Mohammed
would never have become the prophet of his nation.</p>

<p>“Although poor in goods which are but transient possessions, inconstant
shadows,” said Abu Talib at the marriage feast, “my nephew Mohammed
exceeds all the men of the Koreish in nobility of soul, virtue, and understanding.”</p>

<p>The marriage was blessed with children, but the sons died at a tender
age; and of the four daughters only the youngest, Fatima, continued the
race. Mohammed recognised and valued Khadija’s superior qualities. In
spite of his great fondness for the female sex he remained faithful to her so
long as she lived, and after her death held her memory in high honour.
Aisha, his beloved wife of later days, said she was never so jealous of any
of his other wives as she was of the dead Khadija whom he always declared
to be a model for all women.</p>

<p>For more than a decade after his marriage Mohammed continued his life
as a merchant, but with little success and little content. He was often seen
to be deep in thought; he withdrew more and more into solitude, spending
many days and generally the whole of the month Ramadhan in a cave in
Mount Hira, not far from Mecca. Sometimes he went into this retirement
alone, sometimes with Khadija.</p>

<p>There in that gloomy neighbourhood, full of naked rocks, yawning precipices,
and grim ravines where no shade affords protection from the blazing
sunlight, where no grass, no vegetation, no sound of falling water refreshes
the spirit, he gave himself up to religious contemplations and considered how
he might save his nation from its degradation. In the city of Mecca, all
alive as it was with people, as well as on his journeys, he had been brought
much in contact with Jews and Christians; he had not only absorbed their
teaching and traditions, but from the effects of their religion on life and
character he had perceived the superiority of the belief in one God over the
idolatrous heathenism of his own nation; and he had also learned that both
religious fraternities still waited for the completion of their religion; the
Jews looking for the advent of a messiah, the Christians for the return of
Jesus or the appearance of the promised “comforter” (<i>paraclete</i>). Thus there
gradually awoke in him the conviction that his people stood in need of a
purer revealed religion, that the idols were but vain trifles, and that their
worship excited the anger of God; that a new and divinely inspired prophet
must come forward, who should overturn the kingdom of darkness and
idolatry, and his fiery imagination filled him with the belief that the one God
had sent him to convert mankind that they might become participators in
the joys of heaven, and escape the fearful chastisements of hell. His nervous,
hysterical nature, the violent convulsions and cataleptic fits which seized him
from time to time, the vivid dreams and mental delusions produced by his
feverish and excited fancy, might well engender in himself and others the
belief that he had relations with angels and spirits, and was a sharer in
divine visions and inspirations. Mohammed had already passed his fortieth
year when he “began to feel the travail of new ideas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h4>MOHAMMED AS A PROPHET (610 OR 612 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[610-612 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Once when he was dwelling in the gloomy cavern he had a vision, in
which the angel Gabriel approached him and commanded him to publish
abroad the revelations which the Lord and Creator had sent. Mohammed
felt his spirit illuminated with a divine light; but doubting lest a demon
should be playing him an evil trick, he came to Khadija, his face streaming
with perspiration and utterly discomposed. She believed in the divine message,
and in union with her learned cousin Waraka, who had already denied
the pagan beliefs of the fathers, she laboured to dispel his doubt.</p>

<p>Soon the angel appeared to him a second time, and gave him an assurance
that he was not possessed by demons but called of God to spread the
revelations of heaven. Mohammed now believed and announced that Allah,
the lord of heaven and earth, had chosen him as his ambassador to inform men
of his holy will; he now believed and taught that the Lord spake by him,
and that his utterances were inspirations and revelations from the only and
most high God, and being written down separately and eventually put
together in the sacred book <i>Koran</i>,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4c">c</a></span> they were so regarded by the faithful
and accepted with reverence. Thus began Mohammed’s prophetic career in
the year 610 or 612 of our era. Like the seers of old, like the prophets
in Israel, he took the enthusiasm which dwelt in him as a “charge from the
Lord,” and the words which issued from his mouth as the outpourings of
the divine spirit.</p>

<p>Convinced of the truth of his prophetic mission, Mohammed now entered
on his office of teacher. But with all his devotion to the holy cause
he went to work with great caution. He first turned to his kinsmen that
he might be recognised by them as the messenger of God. His wife Khadija,
his daughters, his cousin Ali, the ten-year-old son of Abu Talib, his friend
Abu Bekr, a well-to-do merchant of upright character and clear discernment,
and his former slave Zaid to whom he had given his liberty were his first
converts. In like manner he avoided anything which might have irritated
his compatriots.</p>

<p>“He sought to bring his teaching into harmony with their prejudices
and to lead them gradually to a better knowledge. He did not venture to
attack the sanctity of the Kaaba, joined in the ceremonies of the pilgrim
festival, and sanctioned the adoration of the Black Stone.”</p>

<p>Thus three years went by, during which the number of Mohammed’s
adherents did not exceed forty, for the most part young men, foreigners or
slaves. It was not till the fourth year that in accordance with another
vision he attempted to appear publicly in the character of a prophet. He
first addressed himself to the men of his own race, the Koreish; and in the
name of the one God who had sent him as his apostle, threatened them with
the fire of hell if they did not renounce their unbelief.</p>

<p>“One day ye shall die and rise again; then must ye give account of
your deeds and shall be rewarded for your virtue in paradise and punished
for your vices in hell.”</p>

<p>But far from winning a hearing he reaped mockery and scorn. Already
in the first assembly his uncle Abu Lahab had lifted a stone against him;
and although the rest of his kinsmen protected him from ill-treatment, the
hatred and opposition of the Koreish increased with each new oration. The
more clearly they perceived that Mohammed’s claims as a prophet might
endanger their priestly position and their lucrative privileges as guardians
of the holy temple, the more fiercely did their anger burn, and the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
vehement became their threats and abuse. His chief opponents were the
Koreish of the line of the Abd Shams, under the leadership of Abu Sufyan
and Abu Hakam, called by Mohammed, Abu Jahl (the father of folly),
two bitter enemies of the new prophet. It was only to the protection of
his nearest relatives that Mohammed owed his rescue from the violence of his
enemies and persecutors. On the other hand the position of his adherents
of humble rank, who had no such powerful protectors to stand by them,
especially of the slaves and freedmen, grew daily more insecure; so that in
order that they might escape torture and scourging the prophet allowed
some of his followers to deny him outwardly “if only the heart remained
steadfast in the faith,” and on his advice a number of believing men and
women, amongst them his daughter Rokayyah and her husband Othman,
took ship for Abyssinia, where the king, a Nestorian Christian, assured them
a refuge. In vain did the Koreish through Amru and another ambassador,
offer the prince rich gifts for the delivery of the refugees; the Abyssinian
kept his hands pure of any injury to those who had sought his protection.
He may have perceived that the persecuted stood nearer to the true faith
than the idol worshippers of the Kaaba.</p>

<h4>MOHAMMED AN OUTLAW</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[612-620 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The invective and ill-treatment which Mohammed had to suffer increased
the number of his followers, whilst indignation at the abuse and insults to
which he was daily exposed without any fault of his own led certain brave
men of chivalrous disposition to take his part. Amongst them were Mohammed’s
uncle Hamza, “the lion of God,” and Jahl’s nephew Omar. Having
been sent by his relatives to kill the prophet for a great reward, on the way to
the latter’s dwelling Omar was suddenly and miraculously converted by hearing
his sister Fatima read a passage of the <i>Koran</i>, and from being a persecutor
he became an earnest believer. Omar, then twenty-six years old, was a
man of gigantic stature, of fabulous strength, and great courage. His wild
aspect terrified the boldest, and his staff struck more fear into the beholder
than would have been inspired by another man’s sword.</p>

<p>But the more devotees “Islam” <i>i.e.</i>, “submission” (to the will of
God) acquired, the more eagerly did its enemies seek to stifle the work in
the blood of its author. New persecutions increased the number of the
emigrants; only Mohammed and his most faithful worshippers were protected
by Abu Talib from the rage of the sons of Shams and Naufal. He
hid them in a strong castle without the city, in the depths of an impassable
ravine, and when their powerful enemies laid a ban on all the followers of
the prophet and the whole race of Hashim and solemnly declared in a roll
which was hung up in the interior of the Kaaba that until he was given up
they would treat his protectors as enemies, the faithful uncle betook himself
to the rocky fortress with many of his kinsmen. For three years they lived in
the barren desert, cut off from all communication with the city, whither
they could venture only in the sacred months, and often they were in want
of the most necessary means of existence. Finally the ban, which had
excited the greatest discontent in Mecca, and of which even the sons of
Shams were beginning to grow weary, was removed. The parchment roll
disappeared from the Kaaba, according to the legend, by a miracle. Mohammed
now returned to Mecca (<i>circa</i> 620); but soon the death of his paternal
friend and protector, Abu Talib, who was followed to the grave a few days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
later by his faithful wife Khadija, exposed him to fresh dangers. Abu Talib
died in the religion of his fathers; he had always honoured his nephew as
an upright and god-fearing man, but he had never believed in his prophetic
mission. Mohammed sincerely mourned them both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[620-622 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>“Never was there a better wife than Khadija,” he said once to the
youthful and beautiful Aisha; “she believed in me when men despised me;
she relieved my wants when I was poor and despised by the world.” Nevertheless
he soon consoled himself for her loss by his marriage to Sauda and
his betrothal to Aisha, the seven-year old daughter of Abu Bekr.</p>

<p>While the prophet was leading a melancholy existence under scorn and
ignominy, sometimes in Mecca, sometimes in the society of a few friends in
Taif, a place lying in a fruitful region on the borders of the hill country,
hiding himself with difficulty from the snares and persecutions of his enemies,
his soul felt itself comforted and exalted by new visions. He saw in
the spirit how he was borne on a winged horse to the temple at Jerusalem
and thence to the seventh heaven to the presence of God, where the patriarchs,
the earlier prophets, and the hosts of angels yielded him precedence,
and the Lord himself proclaimed him as the crown and aim of creation.
He needed this self-confidence, this firm belief in his high message, to keep
him from wavering and succumbing to the storms and dangers which gathered
over his head.</p>

<p>But whilst the inhabitants of Mecca hardened their hearts against the
doctrine of the one God, revealing himself through the new prophet, Mohammed
won eager devotees from a host of pilgrims from Yathreb, afterwards
called Medina, <i>i.e.</i>, the city, to whom he unfolded the principles of Islam on
the “mount of homage,” Akaba. They belonged to the distinguished tribe
of the Khazraj who, in conjunction with the tribe of Aus had, in the fifth
century, wrested the lordship of Medina from the Jews; and on their return
to their native city they worked in secret for the new faith for which,
in consequence of their relations with the numerous Jewish tribes in the
neighbourhood, they were better prepared than the Meccans. In spite of
the jealousy of the tribes of Aus towards the Khazraj, by the energy of the
learned Masab, whom Mohammed sent to Medina as his forerunner and as
reader of the <i>Koran</i>, Islam soon obtained a firm foothold in the city; so that
two years later his adherents could venture to invite the prophet to visit
them. With this object seventy-three believers journeyed to Mecca and
in an assembly held at night on that same hill of homage they made a covenant
with Mohammed. They vowed, and gave their hands on the promise,
to pray only to the one God and to none other gods, to honour the prophet, to
obey him in joy and sorrow, and always confess the truth without fear of
man. Under the guidance of twelve leaders, whom Mohammed selected
from amongst them, the men of Medina (who thenceforth bore the name of
Ansar, <i>i.e.</i>, those who give aid) returned to their own city in the company
of many believers.</p>

<h4>THE HEGIRA (622 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[622 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But Mohammed, with his most faithful adherents Abu Bekr and Ali,
remained in Mecca three months longer. Only when he was informed by a
secret worshipper that the Koreish had determined to murder him, did he
depart on his flight with Abu Bekr, both mounted on swift camels. Whilst
the enemy was surrounding his house, the craft and fidelity of Ali, who
occupied the prophet’s bed and assumed his garments, enabled him and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
friend to flee secretly in the darkness of the night and conceal themselves in
a cave. Next morning, when the Koreish discovered the deception, they set
a price of a hundred camels on the head of the fugitive and sent in pursuit
of him. But Mohammed’s destiny was not yet fulfilled. After having
spent three days and nights in the cave of Mount Thaur, he succeeded in
escaping with his companion by by-paths to Medina. With this flight, which
was afterwards assigned to the 16th of July of the year 622 according to
our reckoning, begins the Hegira, the era of the Mohammedans or Moslems
(Mussulmans), <i>i.e.</i>, the “submissive.” [Ali remained three days after his
master had left. Considerable property had been entrusted to Mohammed
for safe keeping; and it was Ali’s duty to restore this to its owners.]</p>

<p>The people of Medina received Mohammed with joyous enthusiasm; his
entrance into the town resembled that of a triumphant prince rather than a
poor fugitive. Soon the rest of his friends and followers gathered round him,
amongst them Ali whom the Koreish had allowed to go unharmed, Omar,
with his beautiful daughter Hafsa, whom some time afterward the prophet
included in the number of his wives, and Othman with his wife Rokayyah.
When the last-named died in the following year, Mohammed gave his second
daughter Um Kolthum in marriage to his faithful comrade. The case containing
the inspired sayings of the <i>Koran</i> was entrusted to the care of
Hafsa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[622-624 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The prophet’s presence had the most beneficial results for Medina. The
two tribes of the Khazraj and the Aus, who in former years had often
engaged in bloody conflicts, were united in the new faith as the faithful
“helpers” of God’s messenger, and in conjunction with the emigrants from
Mecca (Mohajira) formed the kernel of the Moslems. At first Mohammed
attempted to win over the numerous Jews of Medina to his cause, and for
this reason paid attention in many respects to the Mosaic law; he continued
the observance of the Sabbath, and made Jerusalem the Kibla, <i>i.e.</i>, the holy
place, towards which the faithful had to turn their faces when they prayed.
But when the Jews refused to recognise him as the expected Messiah as they
had formerly refused to recognise Jesus, but rather made the new prophet an
object of their scorn, he once more turned to the old Arab faith. He
removed the Kibla to Mecca, appointed Friday as the day of devotion and
religious observance, and eventually wielded the scourge of religious persecution
over Jews and heathens without distinction.</p>

<p>Many of the emigrant Meccans were overtaken by illness and homesickness
in this foreign land, and in order to make up to them for the loss of
their relatives and belongings, Mohammed founded a system of brotherhood
among fifty-four believers from Mecca and a like number from Medina, so
that two men united in this “brotherhood of faith” should stand closer to
each other, even in the matter of inheritance, than blood relations,&mdash;an institution
which lasted, however, only until the foreigners had settled into
the new life.</p>

<p>A second period in the history of the development of Islam begins in
Medina. But however brilliantly and successfully Mohammed’s prophetic
labours might continue from this time forward, his character during the
period of his fortune was less spotless, his conviction less sincere, his motives
less pure than in the dark and suffering time of persecution and oppression.
His revelations, which he received from the angel Gabriel as occasion arose,
were circulated as inspired sayings amongst the people, partly through oral
tradition, partly in fly-leaves until they were put together in one whole as
the holy writing (<i>Koran</i>). They were not drawn up without occasional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
adjustment to the circumstances of the moment and to his own appetites,
a transformation which reveals itself even in the form and the language.
For whilst in the parts drawn up in Mecca poetic enthusiasm prevails to an
undue extent, in Medina the oratorical element is more in the foreground;
for Mohammed, all too closely bound to material things, was no longer able
to disengage himself from them. In the lack of personal conviction which
now supervened, if he wished to rise above the commonplace he had
to supply the inner impulse by affected vividness, and the truth firmly
believed by empty sophistry; and from his manner of writing it is easy to see
that his thoughts no longer spring from a warm heart, but are the products
of a cold intellect. No longer following the suggestions of his mind can he
allow his discourse to pursue its natural course;
all must now be thought out beforehand, for it is
no longer guided by the spirit of God but by his
own <i>ego</i>. The first mosque, a simple, artless
building made of the wood of date trees, which
was erected soon after his arrival in Medina,
became a sacred centre of his teaching. From its
roof, five times each day, the steadfast devotee
Bilal summoned the faithful to prayer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p119.jpg" width="150" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arab Chief in the Time of Mohammed</span></p>
</div>

<p>Hitherto Islam had been a religion of peace
and love, and Mohammed had inculcated no
precept as he had that of gentleness in word
and deed. But now that he found himself at
the head of a submissive host of followers and
in a position to oppose his enemies by force of
arms, he declared the struggle against the infidel,
the spread of his doctrines by fire and
sword, to be the sacred duty binding on all Moslems,
a precept which gave Islam an aggressive
direction and had in its results a world-shaking
significance. Not to bring peace, but a sword,
had he, the last and greatest of the prophets,
appeared on earth; the struggle against the
enemies of Islam was a sacred struggle; he who
fell in the contest would pass, free from all sin
and punishment, safely into paradise, that abode
of the blessed which he had painted to his converts
with all the ardour of his imagination as
a place of earthly pleasures and all the joys of
sense; and still further to inflame their courage
he planted in their souls the contempt of death
by teaching them that the duration of life as well as the destiny and end
of mankind had been fixed beforehand by a divine decree, by an unchangeable
fate; if the hour of death had come, none could escape his destiny, if
the end of life had not yet approached, he might unhesitatingly venture the
utmost.</p>

<p>Relying on the warlike impulse which such doctrines must have engendered
in the fiery soul of the Arab, Mohammed, at the head of his fellow
tribesmen, allies, and believing followers, now undertook warlike expeditions
against the Koreish who had driven him from his native city. He knew that
he could not more effectively punish the haughty merchant princes of Mecca
than by lying in wait for their caravans and robbing them of the valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
wares which they were accustomed to take to Syria. At the same time he
could absolutely rely on the assistance of his new fellow-citizens in these
struggles, for the merchants of Mecca looked down with contempt on the
agricultural people of Medina. He himself generally marched into the field
more to fire the courage of the combatants by his prayers and promises of
heavenly support than for the purpose of himself bearing the white standard,
which he generally entrusted to the valiant Omar, or the heroic Ali, the
“father of the dust.”</p>

<p>Ali, to whom Mohammed gave his favourite daughter Fatima in marriage
at Medina, is the purest and noblest figure among the followers of Mohammed,
the “Siegfried of Islam,” as a modern writer has designated him. All
his life he adhered to the prophet and the faith of his youth with complete
submission and eager admiration. If his fiery, pure, and magnanimous character
made him the boast and ornament of the Moslems, he was also by his
heroism and bravery the bold vindicator of Islam, the trumpet of the strife
in struggle and danger.</p>

<p>If at first warfare was suspended during the sacred months, according to
the practice of former generations, Mohammed soon tore down this barrier.
For instance, Abdallah ben Jash fell on the Koreish in the valley of Nakhla
during the sacred month of Rajab, robbed their wagons, and slew some of
the escort and took others prisoners; and when the prophet, who had himself
recommended this act to the leader in a dubiously worded document,
perceived that it had excited general indignation, he issued a proclamation
by which war against the infidel was declared to be lawful at any period&mdash;a
proof “that he was no longer acting according to the will of God but according
to his own will”; and that the utterances of the <i>Koran</i> were so many
“pictures reflecting” his own position. In the second year of the Hegira
the fight of Bedr took place; and here was manifested for the first time
how the hope of a blessed hereafter had filled the believing Moslems with
an enthusiasm which defied death and despised pain.</p>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF BEDR (624 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[624 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In order to rescue a large caravan from danger and distress, the Koreish
marched into the field a thousand strong, with seven hundred camels and
one hundred horses. The train of merchandise escaped the ambush by the
clever management of Abu Sufyan, but nevertheless Abu Jahl persisted in
the conflict. At Bedr, a camping ground and market, noted even at the present
day for its plentiful supply of water, the Meccans encountered the
hostile bands, who were not half so strong, and made ready for battle.
Three Meccans, kinsmen of those who had fallen at Nakhla, came forward
and challenged three of the opposite party to single combat. Hamza, Ali,
and Obaida opposed themselves to them and slew them, whereupon the fight
became general. Mohammed, who was watching the encounter from a
leafy hut on a rising ground and praying to God with great ardour and
excitement that he would not allow his faithful few to be destroyed,
suddenly declared that victory had been promised him in a vision, and
flinging a handful of dust after the Koreish, he called out, “Shame on their
faces!”</p>

<p>Soon confusion seized the enemy and the battle ended with a complete
defeat of the Koreish. Seventy heads of distinguished houses were slain
during the battle or on the flight. Amongst the fallen were Otba and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Shaiba, and, above all Abu Jahl (called the enemy of God), Mohammed’s
bitterest opponent; amongst the prisoners were his uncle Abbas and Abul-Aas,
the husband of his eldest daughter Zainab. Both were ransomed and
returned to Mecca. Abbas probably henceforth served his nephew as a spy
and Abul-Aas had to send his wife back to her father. Two other prisoners,
Al-Nadr and Okba, who had belonged to Mohammed’s most eager adversaries
in Mecca, were executed. But the prophet, always inclined to mildness,
deplored the rash act when he heard the touching lament of the former’s
daughter, a lament which is still preserved to us. For the rest, the battle
of Bedr was of the greatest importance for the victory of Islam, and in consequence
all the combatants whose names were entered in the lists henceforth
formed the highest nobility of the Moslems. The spoil and the ransoms
were equally divided, but soon after a saying of the <i>Koran</i> commanded that
in future the fifth part of all spoil should go to the prophet, for himself, his
kinsmen, for the poor, orphans, and wanderers.</p>

<h4>BATTLE OF OHOD (MARCH, 625 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[625 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The battle of Bedr was the first step of Islam to dominion. Whilst the
inhabitants of Medina and the Bedouin tribes of the neighbourhood drew
from the prophet’s success a belief in his divine mission and gathered round
him with enthusiasm, in Mecca there was great despair. Abu Lahab, Mohammed’s
uncle and enemy, died seven days later of a disease resembling
smallpox, full of affliction and anger at the success of his nephew; and Okba’s
daughter Hind, the passionate wife of Abu Sufyan, cried day and night in
ungoverned fury for revenge for her fallen kinsmen. Her lord actually went
against Medina with two hundred Koreish; but their belief in their own
cause was shaken, and when Mohammed marched against them they fled
home in such haste that they left their stock of meal behind.</p>

<p>In the months after this “meal-campaign,” certain Jews in Medina, having
made a mock of Mohammed in their verses, were put to death, and their
co-religionists who had refused to go over to Islam, in particular the Beni
Kainoka, the most skilful of the wealthy goldsmiths in the country, were
driven into banishment in Syria. Abu Sufyan now marched a second time
to the fight, on this occasion with a force of three thousand Koreish, at whose
head stood three brave men, Akrama a son of Abu Jahl, Khalid, and Amru,
afterwards the most distinguished heroes of the faithful. In the rearguard
was the terrible Hind, with fifteen other women and certain poets who
roused the spirit of vengeance in the army by laments over those slain at
Bedr.</p>

<p>Mohammed wished to await the enemy in the city, but the young men, in
their eagerness for war, demanded a pitched battle. The prophet yielded
to their demand with inward misgivings. On the mount Ohod, whose solitary
granite mass, bare of tree or bush, rises about a league to the north of
Medina, he ranged his warriors, who did not exceed seven hundred, as he had
disdained the help of the Jews and thus so deeply offended their patron, the
Khazrayite Abdallah ben Obayyah, who apart from this was a secret envier
and opponent of Mohammed, that he too had withdrawn with his army.
Mohammed himself fought in the front rank; wearing a red fillet round his
head and waving “the sword of God and his envoy,” he encouraged his men
with axioms of the new faith. Here, too, victory seemed first to incline to
the Moslems; strenuously as Hind and her women, “the daughters of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
stars, with cloudy hair and pearl-ornamented necks,” might encourage
the combatants, promising loving embraces to the victors, and threatening
the flying with shame and death, the ranks of the Meccans nevertheless
gave way. Seven members of the family of Abd ad-Dar, who each in turn
performed the hereditary office of standard-bearer, rolled in the dust. Then
the bowmen, fearing to be too late for the spoil, left the secure position which
Mohammed had assigned them behind the mountain,
and thus gave Khalid an opportunity to fall
with his cavalry on the Moslem rear. The battle
now suddenly took a new turn; the superior numbers
of the Koreish carried the day, Mohammed was
wounded and fell, face downwards, into a trench.
His standard-bearer Mussab, fell, and as he resembled
Mohammed in appearance the rumour,
“Mohammed is dead,” was quickly disseminated
and proved as encouraging to the infidels as it was
destructive to the Moslem. The defeated were
already hurrying away towards Medina, when the
poet Kaab, the son of Malik, recognised the prophet
amongst the wounded, in his helmet and coat of
mail.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p122.jpg" width="150" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arab Warrior, Time of Mohammed</span></p>
</div>

<p>Encouraged by the joyful tidings that Mohammed
was still alive, ten or twelve of his trusty
followers, including Abu Bekr and Omar, collected
round him and carved themselves a way with the
sword towards a rocky height, where they defended
themselves bravely until the enemy, who, supposing
the prophet to be dead, had paid no special
heed to this little band, had begun their homeward
march after insulting and mutilating the dead.
Hind and her companions took the severed noses
and ears of the enemy, strung them together like
pearls, and wore them as necklaces and bracelets.
The former even carried her rage so far that she
tried to tear the heart out of the corpse of Hamza
whom the Abyssinian slave Washi had slain in the
midst of the fight, and to rend it in pieces.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
fall of the faithful Hamza touched Mohammed nearly; he frequently bewailed
him, and the women of Medina raised a general lament over the fallen
hero, whose name was henceforth mentioned in every death-song.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[625-627 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After the retreat of the Koreish, Mohammed returned with his men to
Medina. Hard as the blow had been it could not shake his belief and confidence
in a successful issue. Whilst he consoled the relatives of the slain
with the thought of the happy life hereafter, he prohibited the customary
mourning usages, the striking of the visage, the shaving of the hair, the
rending of the garments, only permitting weeping because “tears give relief
to the afflicted heart”; at the same time he took judicious measures for
defence, in case the Koreish, hearing that the prophet was still alive, should
come back. But they did not venture to expose their weakened army to
fresh dangers; they contented themselves with the victory they had won,
and hoped that in time they might get the better of religious innovations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
if they preserved the sacred city with the Kaaba from all pollution, slew
all Moslems who fell into their hands, and all the readers of the <i>Koran</i>
who should proclaim Islam to the inhabitants of the hill country, and if they
permitted no Mohammedan to enter the Kaaba. For years the followers of
the prophet might not take part in the pilgrimage to Mecca, which in the
sacred months the rest of the Arabs made for the sake of prayer and festival
joys. But the time drew slowly near when in Mecca also the consideration
of the old heathen gods was to sink in the dust, and even the Koreish would
bow the knee before the name of him against whom they now nourished so
deadly a hatred and whom they now persecuted in so bloody a fashion.</p>

<h4>EXPEDITION AGAINST THE JEWS (626 A.D.)</h4>

<p>Mohammed, from the very character of his religion, could not let the
sword rust in its sheath so long as Islam had not attained supremacy. Consequently
he continued to lead his followers on warlike expeditions against
both Jew and heathen. The fact that he himself took part in all the fights
was a great spur to the spirit and courage of his troops; more than once his
life was in danger, but a higher power protected God’s envoy; the sword
fell from a hostile leader who waved it above his head.</p>

<p>Since the battle of Ohod most of the attacks had been directed against
the Jews, who showed themselves more and more hostile to the new religion.
They found a protector in Abdallah ben Obayyah, the chief of the Khazraj,
who, jealous of Mohammed’s growing power amongst his followers, toiled
against the prophet. The Beni Nadir were driven from their strong castles,
after their date palms had been cut down, in defiance of the usages of
Arabian warfare; and they owed their lives solely to the powerful intercession
of Abdallah, but were nevertheless compelled to quit the Arabian country
like the Beni Kainoka before them. But the “hypocrites” continued
to work against Mohammed’s power after a victorious campaign against the
powerful tribe of the Beni Mustalik; Abdallah excited a quarrel between
the “helpers” and the immigrant believers, which was only adjusted by the
skill and prompt decision of the prophet. A saying of the Koran gave
warning against hypocrites, but this time also Abdallah escaped punishment.
Even the evil reports concerning Aisha’s virtue and marital fidelity, which
he and others put into circulation about that time because she was left behind
on a night march and entered the camp on the second day in the company
of a man, were overlooked. Mohammed, in accordance with a revelation,
declared the rumours to be slanders, punished the calumniators who, like the
poet Hassan, maintained her guilt, and cherished Aisha with fresh tenderness;
but Abdallah remained unpunished. Mohammed dreaded the revenge
of the Khazraj.</p>

<h4>SIEGE OF MEDINA, EXTERMINATION OF THE JEWS (627-628 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[627-628 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Soon after the Koreish and other Arab tribes made alliance with the Jewish
Beni Koraiza against the Moslems, and marched on Medina with a force of
ten thousand men. Mohammed did not venture to meet the superior strength
of the enemy in the open field for fear lest he should be overtaken by a fate
such as he had suffered at Ohod. He had recourse to a method of defence
hitherto unknown in Arabia. He drew a trench round the city. By means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of this defence he kept off the enemy by small skirmishes for a time, until by
crafty negotiations he succeeded in sowing mistrust and division among the
allies. The consequence was that the Arabs, who besides this had been disheartened
by the wintry weather and cold showers of rain, retreated after an
ineffectual blockade of five weeks; thus abandoning their Jewish allies to
Mohammed’s vengeance. Besieged in their strong castles the Beni Koraiza
had to surrender at discretion. Thereupon in spite of the intercession of
their ancient allies the Aus, according to the harsh decision of the chief
Zaid ben Muadh, who had been selected as arbitrator, all the men of the
tribe, seven hundred in number, were executed on the market-place of
Medina, the women and children were led into slavery, and their flocks,
lands, and goods were divided among the victors.</p>

<p>“God drove the keepers of the Scriptures (the Jews) from their strong
places and put fear in their hearts. One half of them has he slain, the other
taken prisoners; he has given you their lands, their dwellings, their goods,
for an inheritance. God is almighty.”</p>

<p>In these words a saying of the <i>Koran</i> announced this horrible event, the
darkest deed of Mohammed’s life. Zaid died soon after the cruel sentence.
Irritated by the continual perfidy and the hostile temper of the Jews, Mohammed
had allowed himself to be drawn into a course in which the messenger
of God gave way to the passionate Arab, in which not the temper of a
prophet but the revenge of the passionate Arab and the cruelty of an oriental
despot were manifested, in which “earthly mire choked the sacred flame of
prophecy.” And in order finally to destroy the power of the Jews in Medina
and the neighbourhood, Mohammed in the following year (628) marched with
fourteen hundred believers against their chief fortress of Khaibar.</p>

<p>“We pray to thee, oh Almighty! against the goods of these places and
all that they contain,” cried the prophet with a loud voice, when they entered
the territory of their strong citadels, “and we implore thee to preserve
us from the evil of these places and their inhabitants.”</p>

<p>Mohammed’s prayer was heard. By the bravery of the Moslems, especially
of Ali, to whom before the battle the prophet had given his own
sword&mdash;“Ali, the man who loves God and his envoy, the man who knows
no fear and never yet turned his back on the enemy”&mdash;the castles were
broken into, their treasures and goods carried off, the inhabitants, when
they escaped the sword, made tributary so that they had to hold their rich
estates and date plantations as hereditary tenants and pay the half of the
produce to the new owners. The Mohammedans were roused to these warlike
enterprises no less by the greed of spoil than by religious fanaticism.
The Jewish chief Kinana was stretched on the rack to make him betray
hidden treasures, and when he remained dumb he was beheaded. Mohammed
himself not only appropriated the fifth share of the spoil, but also landed
property, and he increased the number of his wives by two beautiful Jewish
prisoners, Safiya and Zainab. The first was converted to Islam and became
a tender wife to the prophet, who celebrated the bridal with her in his tent;
on the other hand the second, whose nearest relatives had met their death
in the battle, meditated a dark act of vengeance. She placed a poisoned meal
before Mohammed. It is true that he ate little of it (in consequence of a
miraculous warning, as the legend recounts), but still it was enough to
undermine his health for the remainder of his life. Even in his dying hour
he is reported to have said that he felt the poison of Khaibar<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in his veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<h4>MOHAMMED’S PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA (629 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[629 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Even before this war Mohammed had made a pilgrimage to Mecca with
a considerable following, to try whether under shelter of the sacred month
he could approach the Kaaba, acting under the just conviction that it would
be of great advantage to the spread of his doctrines if he could associate
himself with the ancient sanctuary of his people. This time indeed he
failed to attain his object; the gates of Mecca remained closed to the
Mohammedans; nevertheless by the Peace of Hodaibiya he won a ten years’
truce from the Koreish and the concession that he and his believers should
perform their prayers in the Kaaba for three days annually. The zealous
Omar was indignant at this agreement. “Art thou not the messenger of
the Lord? Are the Meccans not infidels and we believers? Wherefore
should we permit our faith to endure such an insult?”</p>

<p>But Mohammed preferred the lesser advantage to the uncertain issue of
an armed conflict, convinced that greater successes would soon follow from
small beginnings. He was not mistaken. In consequence of this treaty
and shortly after the fall of Khaibar, he undertook (March, 629) a pilgrimage
to Mecca, together with a party of his faithful followers, and great was
the joy of the exiles when for the first time they again trod their native soil.
Mohammed, mounted on his camel, accomplished the usual seven circuits of
the Kaaba and the pacing to and fro between the hills Safa and Merwa and
the rest followed him.</p>

<p>On this occasion Mohammed was united to Maimuna, a widow of fifty-one
years. As his former marriages since the death of Khadija were decided
by his sensuality and fondness for women and had at times been so scandalous
that, as in the case of Zainab, the divorced wife of his adopted son Zaid,
the indignation of the faithful at a hitherto unheard of and forbidden alliance
had to be quieted by a new command in the <i>Koran</i> concerning relationship;
so on the contrary this last marriage was like his first, an act
of wisdom, policy, and practical consideration. By this marriage Maimuna’s
kinsmen, Khalid and Amru, two distinguished warriors, were won over to
the cause of Islam&mdash;a victory of greater importance than many a victorious
battle.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p126.jpg" width="150" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Arab Warrior</span></p>
</div>

<p>The converts soon had an opportunity of increasing on a wider battle-field
the warlike renown which they had acquired in petty quarrels. Mohammed
had already turned his eyes to the frontiers of Arabia. Encouraged
by the growing numbers and enthusiasm of his devotees, he believed that
the time was not far off when Islam would acquire the dominion of the
world. The Jews had been compelled to pay dearly for refusing to recognise
him as their messiah; but, since they lived scattered and held in contempt
amongst other nations he could well dispense with their homage if he
succeeded in bringing the two most powerful religious associations of the
time, namely the Christians and the fire-worshippers of Iran, to acknowledge
his prophetic mission. With this object he addressed documents to various
foreign rulers, calling on them to worship the one true God who had revealed
himself through Mohammed. Amongst the Christians especially he might
have expected a great welcome, since he not only owned Jesus to be a
prophet but also recognised the latter’s mother as a spotless virgin. In one
of the finest passages of the <i>Koran</i> it is related how Mary, after the angel of
God had informed her that she should bear a “pure son,” had brought a
child into the world under a palm tree; how this child had spoken even
in the cradle and revealed himself as the “servant of God,” destined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
exercise every virtue of life and bring peace to men. According to the
Moslems, the ordinances of Mohammed’s religion found a favourable reception
amongst Christian princes. The king of Abyssinia, who had always
shown himself favourable to the adherents of the new prophet, and the
Christian general at Yemen are said to have gone over to Islam; the prefect
of Egypt requested time for consideration, but sent costly gifts, among them
two fair Coptic slaves for the voluptuous prophet. The messengers of
Mohammed invited the princes and nations of the earth to join in the recognition
of Islam, and one of them was even received by the emperor Heraclius
in a gracious and friendly manner. On the
other hand Chosroes II, then at the height of
his power, tore the documents unread and at the
same time the ruler of Bosrah slew an Arabian
envoy who had endeavoured to win new converts
for Islam. Against the former, Mohammed
launched a prophecy of evil, against the
latter sent an army under his former slave Zaid,
whom on account of his faithfulness and submission
he had taken in the place of a son.</p>

<p>At Muta in Syria the Arabian hosts under
the sacred standard had their first encounter
with the Græco-Roman legions. Zaid fell like
a warrior in the foremost ranks; in his place
the brave and handsome Jafar, Ali’s brother,
seized Mohammed’s banner. Soon after he lost
his right hand; then he waved the standard
in his left, and when this too was severed
from his body he held the sacred ensign in his
bleeding arms till he received the deathstroke.
Abdallah ben Rawaha, the poet, now took the
standard from the dying hero, crying, “Forward!
Either victory or paradise is ours!”
And when he too sank under the enemy’s lances
Khalid, the new convert of Mecca, grasped the
banner and guided the battle to a finish. It
was not a decisive victory; but Khalid had
given such brilliant proofs of valour that in
the nocturnal council of war held in the camp
he was chosen commander-in-chief and henceforth
bore the famous surname of “Sword of
God.” Mournfully, though laden with glory and spoil, the warrior host
returned to Medina with the cherished corpses. Mohammed extolled the
lot of the fallen martyrs, but with Zaid’s young daughter he mourned in secret
for the beloved dead. “These are friendship’s tears at the loss of a friend,”
he said in excuse when someone coming in expressed his astonishment that he
should weep for him who had secured paradise by his death.</p>

<h4>SUBJECTION OF MECCA (630 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[630 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>All therefore that Mohammed could hope was that his teaching might
obtain general recognition throughout Arabia, if he could once get the sacred
city of Mecca into his power. When he first led his armed host of pilgrims<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
into its neighbourhood he had assured his companions that God had lent
him the victory. Yet they had been compelled to withdraw, after concluding
an inglorious peace without marching round the Kaaba. Nor was the
chagrin of the believers relieved in the next year by their having to approach
the sanctuary during three days as suppliants; the disgrace could only be
wiped out by a brilliant victory. The Koreish themselves played into
Mohammed’s hands. They violated the treaty of peace by taking part in a
hostile attack on a tribe which had made a defensive alliance with Mohammed.
Then when they heard that an expedition for reprisals was being
prepared at Medina they were alarmed and sent Abu Sufyan, the proud
chief of the race, to the angry prophet, to excuse what had passed and
implore his forgiveness.</p>

<p>But Mohammed dismissed the suppliant without an answer and secretly
pushed on the preparations for war with great zeal. Suddenly ten thousand
watchfires on the neighbouring mountain betrayed the arrival of a powerful
enemy to the astonished Meccans. Abu Sufyan hastened out to reconnoitre;
Abbas brought him as a prisoner into the camp, where Mohammed protected
him from Omar’s anger as soon as he had declared himself ready to honour
the son of Abdallah as the messenger of God and to pass to the ranks of Islam.
He noted with admiration the excellent discipline and bearing of the Mohammedan
army, the multiplicity of weapons and banners, the “helpers” and
“refugees” enveloped in iron, the enthusiastic veneration of the holy commander.
“None can withstand this man!” Sufyan said to Mohammed’s
uncle, Abbas, who was conducting him through the ranks, “by God, the
kingdom of thy nephew is grown great!” And he hastened back to his
people to persuade them to peaceful submission. In this he was successful.
The most part shut themselves up in their houses, as Mohammed had commanded,
so that the Moslem army was able to take possession of the city
almost without resistance. Only Khalid had to carve a way for himself into
the lower city through a host of unbelievers whom Akrama, the son of Abu
Jahl, had collected under his banner.</p>

<p>When Mohammed saw the chiefs of the Koreish in the dust at his feet, his
pride was satisfied and the nobler feelings of mildness and magnanimity
reigned in his breast. The people declared themselves ready to abjure their
gods, to honour Mohammed as God’s messenger and obey his behests, whereupon
the victor, now throned in his native city as prince and prophet after
eight years of banishment, proclaimed a general amnesty. Even of the
twelve men and six women whom, after his entry into the city, Mohammed
had condemned because in former years they had excited his anger by apostasy,
treachery, or mocking ballads, the majority were pardoned. Amongst
them was Akrama, the son of Abu Jahl, who had fought so bravely at Ohod
and had offered resistance to Khalid’s entrance; his uncle the satirical poet
Harith; Safwan, son of Omayyah and Hind, the passionate wife of Abu
Sufyan; the poet Kaab; Abdallah, Mohammed’s scribe, who was accused of
having defaced the sacred fly-leaves of the <i>Koran</i> and in order to escape
punishment had fled as an apostate to Mecca; and many others. They all
went over to Islam, and Akrama soon exhibited the same heroism in battle
for the new faith which he had formerly displayed against Mohammed. For
Abdallah, his kinsman Othman made intercession; Mohammed hesitated for
some time over the pardon, in the hope that one of his adherents would kill
the traitor; then unwillingly let him go.</p>

<p>When order had been restored in the city Mohammed presented himself at
the temple. He went round the Kaaba seven times on his camel, each time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
touching the sacred stone with his staff, and then broke in pieces the idols,
360 in number, which were placed round the sanctuary. After this he had
the doors of the temple thrown open, cleansed the house of the Lord from
all images, and commanded Bilal to proclaim to the multitude the call to
prayer from the summit.</p>

<p>From the time of the prophet’s entry into Mecca the victory of Islam
in Arabia was only a question of time. But no religious organisation is
destroyed without some of its adherents contending for it with their hearts’
blood. The old Arabian gods too had their steadfast worshippers, who did
not shrink from a martyr’s death for the religion of their youth. When
Mohammed’s hosts under fanatical leaders penetrated to the surrounding
tribes, the idols were thrown down and the ancient sanctuaries destroyed,
and then the infuriated pagans put themselves on the defensive and many
a sacrifice bled to the religious frenzy. On one such expedition into the
district of Teyma, the zealous Khalid proceeded with such harshness and
cruelty that Mohammed shuddered at it, and lifting his hands to heaven cried
out, “I have no share in these deeds.” He then endeavoured to appease
the sufferers through the medium of Ali’s
mildness and magnanimity, offered expiation
for those slain, and announced that
Mecca and all the country should be as inviolable
in the future as in the past.</p>

<h4>THE VICTORY OF HONAIN AND AUTAS</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p128.jpg" width="200" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Arab Warrior</span></p>
</div>

<p>The religious frenzy of the Moslems
roused the heathen tribes of the mountain
districts southeast of Mecca to take arms
for the defence of their belief, their life,
and their property against the new religious
society. The Takifites, who had once
driven away the ambassador of the Lord
with stones, and the Hawazin tribes headed
the alliance of the heathen faith. To animate
their courage they took wives, children,
and all their possessions into the
field with them. At this news Mohammed
started with his hosts to subdue his
last obstinate enemy. But as they marched
through the valley of Honain without taking
the necessary precautions, they suddenly
beheld the height occupied with bowmen.
In a short time the ranks of the Moslems
gave way; flight and disorder spread
through them; the prophet’s cry, “I am
Mohammed, the prophet of God, the proclaimer
of the truth; stand fast ye faithful!” was unheeded; the Koreish
who had followed the army were already giving vent to their malicious joy
in mocking words. At this moment Abbas, Mohammed’s uncle, with his
loud voice brought the flying and wavering to their senses. At the cry of
need the bravest and most spirited again collected round the holy prince and
won a complete victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>In the valleys of Honain and Autas the power of the infidels was forever
broken. Seventy were slain, amongst them the old hero Duraid, and the rest
took to flight. Women, children, and spoil fell into the hands of the victors.
But Mohammed’s endeavour to conquer the strong city of Taif was thwarted
by the bravery of the inhabitants and the strength of the walls; it was in vain
that, contrary to his own command, he caused the fruit trees to be felled and
the vineyards to be dug up; in vain had the soldiers marched to the storming
of the town; after a siege of twenty days’ duration he had to withdraw, having
effected nothing. An enormous booty rewarded and consoled the Moslems,
but at Mohammed’s instance the prisoners were restored to the newly
converted tribes. Of his own fifth he presented the greater part to those
among the Koreish who had shown themselves steadfast and faithful, and by
this means he won over many influential men to his cause. Abu Sufyan and
his two sons each received a hundred camels and forty ounces of silver. The
Ansars, who murmured at the favour thus shown to their adversaries, were
appeased by an affectionate appeal:</p>

<p>“Be not angry if I seek to win the hearts of a few waverers with perishable
goods. Your faith and submission have another reward. The messenger
of God intrusts you with his own life and fortune; in your midst he
returns to Medina; and as ye were the companions of my exile and believed
in me in my abasement, so shall ye be the companions of my royalty and
shall share in paradise with me.” They cried out weeping, “We are content
with our lot!”</p>

<p>The rest of the idolatrous tribes now no longer withstood a religion
which Mohammed’s envoys offered them, the <i>Koran</i> in one hand and a
sword in the other. Even the Takifites soon after bought peace and security
by the sacrifice of their ancient gods, and opened the gates of their city
of their own free will.</p>

<p>The Takifites sent ambassadors to inform the prophet that they would
go over to Islam if he would exempt them from prayer and would leave them
their idol Lat but for three years more.</p>

<p>“Three years of idolatry is too long; and what is the worship of God
without prayers?” said Mohammed. The ambassadors then abated their
demands and finally an agreement was arrived at by which the Takifites
were to pay no taxes and were to keep their idol Lat for another year.
Thereupon he began to dictate the record with the words:</p>

<p>“In the name of God the merciful and long-suffering! By this document
an agreement is concluded between Mohammed, the messenger of God
and the Takifites, that the latter shall neither pay taxes nor take part in the
holy war.” But shame and the reproach of conscience arrested his tongue.
“Nor throw themselves on their faces in praying,” added the ambassador;
and as Mohammed persisted in his silence the Takifites repeated, as he
turned to the scribe:</p>

<p>“Write this; it is agreed upon.”</p>

<p>The scribe looked at Mohammed, waiting for his orders. At this moment
the fiery Omar, who had hitherto been a dumb witness of this scene, rose,
and drawing his sword, cried out:</p>

<p>“Thou hast defiled the heart of the prophet, and may God fill yours with
fire.”</p>

<p>“We speak not to thee, but to Mohammed,” answered the ambassador
with composure.</p>

<p>“Good,” said the prophet at this; “I will not hear of such a treaty. Ye
have your choice between an unconditional acceptance of Islam and war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“At least grant us,” said the thunderstruck Takifites, “the worship of
Lat for six months longer!”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then for but one month!”</p>

<p>“Not for an hour!”</p>

<p>On which the ambassadors went back to their city in the company of
Mohammedan soldiers, who broke Lat to pieces amid the lamentations of the
women.</p>

<h4>THE LAST YEARS OF MOHAMMED’S LIFE (630-632 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[630-632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Mohammed returned to Medina like a victorious king; from all sides came
ambassadors and believing followers, to offer their homage and worship, whilst
far to the south his envoys on the seacoast won fresh devotees for Islam.</p>

<p>“We are the helpers of God and the soldiers of his messenger,” said the
poet Thabit in a rhetorical contest; “we make war on all men until they
believe; only he who believes in God and his messenger saves his goods and
his blood; we are at feud with all infidels and our victory is always easy.”</p>

<p>The Arab writers linger affectionately over the different scenes of homage
which the chiefs of the desert tribes, as well as the inhabitants of the cities,
paid to the prophet, the prince of the faithful, in these first years of youthful
enthusiasm. Yet adversities and misfortune troubled the end of his life. A
hostile party under the leadership of Abdallah still subsisted in Medina. This
was especially prominent when the prophet was arranging a fresh expedition
against the Greeks in Syria in an oppressive heat, just when the Arabs were
busied with the date harvest. Consequently many evaded the order and Abdallah
turned back with his men soon after the start. A severe verse of the
<i>Koran</i> rebuked the delay.</p>

<p>“Ye say, ‘go not out during the heat’; but God says by Mohammed,
‘the fire of hell is more scorching.’ Your laughter is but of short duration
and ye shall one day weep long for your behaviour. Ye shall go forth no
more with me and fight no more by my side.”</p>

<p>At Tabuk, between Medina and Damascus, the army came to a halt, that
they might recover in that fertile neighbourhood from the toilsome, painful
march. Here Mohammed received the submission of the chiefs of some of the
Syrian border towns and the homage of a Christian prince. They purchased
peace at the price of an annual tribute. Nevertheless Mohammed did not
deem it advisable to advance further into the enemy’s country with his small
following; he set out on the return march, and through many hardships and
perils arrived at Medina after an absence of twenty days. For a time the
disobedient were excluded from the circle of the believers; but when with
penitence and contrition they sued for forgiveness they were received back
into favour. Soon after this, death freed the prophet from his most dangerous
adversary, Abdallah ben Obayyah. This event, as well as the homage
of more and more Arab tribes, restored his spirits, which had been deeply
affected by the death of his two daughters, Zainab and Umm Kolthum. The
ninth Sura of the <i>Koran</i>, the symbol of the religion of the sword which he
imparted to a host of pilgrims in a reading at the site of the holy temple at
Mecca, may be taken as the outpouring of this exalted state of mind. In
this he renounced peace with all unbelievers, heathen, Jews, and Christians,
forbade them ever to set foot in the sanctuary, and declared perpetual war
against them to be a sacred duty. In it he also reiterated the threats and
curses against the hypocrites and loiterers who delayed to march to the holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
war. Ali’s delivery of this declaration before all the people had the desired
effect. The ambassadors, who in the name of the princes and tribes declared
the latter’s accession to Islam, were as numerous “as the dates which fall
from the palm tree in the time of ripeness.” From the frontier of Syria to
the southern end of the peninsula and to the mountains bordering on the
Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf, tribes of all tongues and religions
hastened to find the key of paradise in the faith in the “One God who has
no fellow.” When in the tenth year of the Hegira, Mohammed, with his
nine wives, proceeded on his last pilgrimage to Mecca, which was to serve
the Moslems for all future times as a pattern and example, 40,000 (or according
to some accounts as many as 114,000) of the faithful accompanied him.</p>

<p>On this pilgrimage the suffering condition of the prophet first became
manifest. With great effort he passed seven times round the Kaaba, and as
he did so he prayed: “O Lord, prosper us in this life and the next, and preserve
us from the pains of hell.” The unnatural agitations and paroxysms
of his soul, the great physical exertions, the insidious poison of Khaibar, and
finally his grief at the loss of his young son Ibrahim, whom, to his extreme
joy, the Egyptian slave Maria had borne to him in the previous year and on
whom he had set all his hopes&mdash;all these things undermined his health and
hastened his end. The laments into which he broke out at sight of the
child’s corpse already contained a foreboding of his own approaching end.</p>

<p>“I am grieved at thy loss,” he said, “mine eye weeps and my heart is
sad, yet will I utter no lament which may anger the Lord; were I not convinced
that I should follow thee, my grief would be inconsolable, but we are
God’s and shall return to him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">[632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Three months after his return Mohammed was overtaken in the house
of his spouse, Aisha, by an illness which lasted from eight to fourteen days.
Often a fierce fever would rob him of consciousness, but often again he had
hours of lucidity which he spent in converse with Aisha, his favourite
daughter Fatima, the only one of his children who survived her father, and
with the friends and relatives who visited him. Besides this, although
already extremely ill, he would still go into the neighbouring mosque and speak
words of admonition and farewell to the assembled people. As his weakness
increased he allowed the prayers to be spoken by Abu Bekr, but was
still always present. On the last day he seemed better, so that all save
Aisha left him. But soon his illness returned with renewed severity.
Before he lost consciousness he gave his slaves their freedom, caused the
six or seven dinars<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which he had in his house to be given to the poor, and
then prayed, “God support me in the death struggle.” Aisha had sent for
her father and his other followers, but before they arrived he expired in the
arms of his favourite wife. His last words were: “To the glorious comrades
in paradise.”</p>

<p>He died in the eleventh year of the Hegira in the three-and-sixtieth year
of his life, “the prophet, poet, priest, and king of Arabia.” On the news of
his departure a great wailing was raised in Aisha’s dwelling, and the people
thronged round the door in wild excitement, which was still further increased
by Omar’s assurances that the messenger of God was not dead, but would
shortly return to his people. Finally the judicious words of Abu Bekr
succeeded in calming the crowd:</p>

<p>“O ye people,” he said, “let him amongst you who served Mohammed
know that Mohammed is dead; but let him who served God continue in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
service, for Mohammed’s God lives and never dies.” Then he read them a
verse of the <i>Koran</i>: “Mohammed is only a messenger, many messengers
are already gone before him; whether he died a natural death or was slain,
shall ye turn on your heels? He who does this (forsakes his faith), can do
no harm to God, but the grateful shall be rewarded.” Despair now passed
into quiet grief; Omar himself was so moved that he fell to the earth and
acknowledged that Mohammed was really dead.</p>

<p>Three days later Mohammed was lowered into the earth at the spot
where he had died. His tomb at Medina was subsequently included within
the bounds of the sanctuary by the enlargement of the mosque, which stood
next to the house, and like the Kaaba of Mecca it has remained up to the
present time to be a place of pilgrimage much resorted to by pious Moslems.
Osama, the youthful son of that Zaid who had fallen at Muta, was absent
on a new campaign against Syria at the moment when he received tidings of
the prophet’s death. He at once led his soldiers back to Medina, and full
of sadness set up his banner before the house.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4f"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4f">f</a></span></p>

<p>The personal traits of Mohammed are preserved to us in wonderfully
minute details and illustrated by numberless anecdotes, many of which are of
course apocryphal. We may quote a brief and vivid picture from the <i>Sirat</i>
or <i>Biography of Mohammed</i>, written by Ibn Saad,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4g1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4g">g</a></span> the secretary of the Arab
historian Wakidi. The translation is from unpublished manuscript notes by
Sir William Muir,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4e1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4e">e</a></span> the modern biographer of Mohammed.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<p>“He was fair of complexion with a measure of redness; eyes intensely
black; his hair not crisp but depending; beard bushy and thick; cheeks
not fat; his neck shone like a vessel of silver; he had a line of hair from
his breast to his navel like a branch, but besides this he had no hair on his
belly or chest. His hands and feet were not hollow, but filled up. When he
walked it was as though he walked from a higher to a lower place; and when
he walked it was as though he pulled (or wrenched) his feet from the stones;
when he turned he turned round entirely. The perspiration on his face was
like pearls, and the smell thereof was pleasanter than musk of pure quality.
He was neither long nor short; he was neither weakly nor vile; the like of
him I never saw before or after.</p>

<p>“Mohammed had a large head, large eyes, large eyelashes; his colour
bright and shining; large joints of his limbs; a long narrow line of hair
from his chest to his belly. He was not very tall, but above the middle
height. When he approached with his people he appeared to cover them
(shutting them out of view). His hair was neither crisp nor frizzled; curly
nor quite smooth and plain. It was like that of a curly-haired man combed
out. His face was neither very fat nor very lean; it was round; he had
large joints and a broad chest. His body was free from hair. Who ever
saw him for the first time would be awe stricken at his appearance, but on
close intimacy this would give way to love. His pupil was intensely black;
his back large.”<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4g2"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4g">g</a></span></p>

<h4>GIBBON’S ESTIMATE OF MOHAMMED AND MOHAMMEDANISM</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[622-632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At the conclusion of the life of Mohammed, it may perhaps be expected
that I should balance his faults and virtues, that I should decide
whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to that
extraordinary man. Had I been intimately conversant with the son of
Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the success uncertain: at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
distance of twelve centuries, I darkly contemplate his shade through a cloud
of religious incense; and could I truly delineate the portrait of an hour, the
fleeting resemblance would not equally apply to the solitary of Mount Hira,
to the preacher of Mecca, and to the conqueror of Arabia. The author of a
mighty revolution appears to have been endowed with a pious and contemplative
disposition; so soon as marriage had raised him above the pressure
of want, he avoided the paths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of
forty, he lived with innocence, and would have died without a name. The
unity of God is an idea most congenial to nature and reason; and a slight
conversation with the Jews and Christians would teach him to despise and
detest the idolatry of Mecca. It was the duty of a man and a citizen to
impart the doctrine of salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of
sin and error. The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object,
would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the warm suggestions
of the understanding or the fancy would be felt as the inspirations
of heaven; the labour of thought would expire in rapture and vision; and
the inward sensation, the invisible monitor, would be described with the
form and attributes of an angel of God.</p>

<p>From enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous and slippery; the
demon of Socrates affords a memorable instance how a wise man may deceive
himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience may
slumber in a mixed middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud.
Charity may believe that the original motives of Mohammed were those
of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human missionary is incapable of
cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his claims, despise his arguments,
and persecute his life; he might forgive his personal adversaries, he
may lawfully hate the enemies of God; the stern passions of pride and
revenge were kindled in the bosom of Mohammed, and he sighed, like the
prophet of Nineveh, for the destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned.
The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina transformed the
citizen into a prince, the humble preacher into the leader of armies; but his
sword was consecrated by the example of the saints; and the same God who
afflicts a sinful world with pestilence and earthquakes might inspire for their
conversion or chastisement the valour of his servants. In the exercise of
political government he was compelled to abate the stern rigour of fanaticism,
to comply, in some measure, with the prejudices and passions of
his followers, and to employ even the vices of mankind as the instruments
of their salvation. The use of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty and injustice,
were often subservient to the propagation of the faith; and Mohammed
commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters who had
escaped from the field of battle.</p>

<p>By the repetition of such acts, the character of Mohammed must have
been gradually stained; and the influence of such pernicious habits would
be poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social virtues,
which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his sectaries
and friends. Of his last years, ambition was the ruling passion; and
a politician will suspect that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!)
at the enthusiasm of his youth and the credulity of his proselytes. A philosopher
would observe that their credulity and his success would tend more
strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine mission, that his interest and
religion were inseparably connected, and that his conscience would be soothed
by the persuasion that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the obligation
of positive and moral laws. If he retained any vestige of his native<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
innocence, the sins of Mohammed may be allowed as the evidence of his sincerity.
In the support of truth, the arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed
less criminal; and he would have started at the foulness of the means, had
he not been satisfied of the importance and justice of the end. The decree
of Mohammed that, in the sale of captives, the mothers should never be
separated from their children, may suspend or moderate the censure of the
historian.</p>

<p>The good sense of Mohammed despised the pomp of royalty; the apostle
of God submitted to the menial offices of the family; he kindled the fire,
swept the floor, milked the ewes, and mended with his own hands his shoes
and his woollen garment. Disdaining the penance and merit of a hermit, he
observed, without effort or vanity, the abstemious diet of an Arab and a
soldier. On solemn occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and
hospitable plenty; but in his domestic life many weeks would elapse without
a fire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet. The interdiction of wine
was confirmed by his example; his hunger was appeased with a sparing
allowance of barley-bread; he delighted in the taste of milk and honey, but
his ordinary food consisted of dates and water. Perfumes and women were
the two sensual enjoyments which his nature required and his religion did
not forbid; and Mohammed affirmed that the fervour of his devotion was
increased by these innocent pleasures. The heat of the climate inflames
the blood of the Arabs; and their libidinous complexion has been noticed
by the writers of antiquity. Their incontinence was regulated by the
civil and religious laws of the <i>Koran</i>; their incestuous alliances were
blamed; the boundless license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate
wives or concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably
determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged; adultery was condemned
as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex, was punished
with a hundred stripes.</p>

<p>Such were the calm and rational precepts of the legislator; but in his
private conduct Mohammed indulged the appetites of a man and abused the
claims of a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws
which he had imposed on his nation; the female sex, without reserve, was
abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative excited the envy
rather than the scandal, the veneration rather than the envy of the devout
Mussulmans. If we remember the seven hundred wives and three hundred
concubines of the wise Solomon, we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian,
who espoused no more than seventeen or fifteen wives; eleven are
enumerated, who occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the
house of the apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favour of his conjugal
society. What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting only
Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bekr. She was doubtless a virgin, since
Mohammed consummated his nuptials (such is the premature ripeness of the
climate) when she was only nine years of age. The youth, the beauty, the
spirit of Aisha, gave her a superior ascendant: she was beloved and trusted
by the prophet; and after his death the daughter of Abu Bekr was long revered
as the mother of the faithful. Her behaviour had been ambiguous
and indiscreet; in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind, and in
the morning Aisha returned to the camp with a man.</p>

<p>The temper of Mohammed was inclined to jealousy; but a divine revelation
assured him of her innocence; he chastised her accusers, and published
a law of domestic peace, that no woman should be condemned unless four
male witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery. In his adventures with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Zainab, the wife of Zaid, and with Maria, an Egyptian captive, the amorous
prophet forgot the interest of his reputation. At the house of Zaid, his
freedman and adopted son, he beheld in a loose undress the beauty of Zainab,
and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire. The servile, or
grateful, freedman understood the hint, and yielded without hesitation to the
love of his benefactor. But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and
scandal, the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the deed, to annul
the adoption, and gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence
of his God. One of his wives, Hafsa, the daughter of Omar, surprised him on
her own bed in the embraces of his Egyptian captive; she promised secrecy
and forgiveness, he swore that he would renounce the possession of Maria.
Both parties forgot their engagements, and Gabriel again descended with a
chapter of the <i>Koran</i>, to absolve him from his oath and to exhort him freely
to enjoy his captives and concubines, without listening to the clamours of his
wives. In a solitary retreat of thirty days, he laboured, alone with Maria, to
fulfil the commands of the angel. When his love and revenge were satiated,
he summoned to his presence his eleven wives, reproached their disobedience
and indiscretion, and threatened them with a sentence of divorce, both in
this world and the next&mdash;a dreadful sentence, since those who had ascended
the bed of the prophet were forever excluded from the hope of a second
marriage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p135.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Saracenic Candlestick</span></p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the incontinence of Mohammed may be palliated by the tradition
of his natural or preternatural gifts; he united the manly virtue of thirty of
the children of Adam, and the apostle might rival the thirteenth labour
of the Grecian Hercules. A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn
from his fidelity to Khadija. During the twenty-four years of their marriage
her youthful husband abstained from the right of polygamy, and the pride or
tenderness of the venerable matron was never insulted by the society of a
rival. After her death he placed her in the rank of the four perfect women,
with the sister of Moses, the mother of Jesus, and Fatima, the best beloved of
his daughters. “Was she not old?” said Aisha, with the insolence of a
blooming beauty, “has not God given you a better in her place?” “No, by
God,” said Mohammed, with an effusion of honest gratitude, “there never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
can be a better! she believed in me when men despised me; she relieved my
wants when I was poor and persecuted by the world.”</p>

<p>In the largest indulgence of polygamy, the founder of a religion and empire
might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous posterity and a lineal
succession. The hopes of Mohammed were fatally disappointed. The virgin
Aisha, and his ten widows of mature age and approved fertility, were barren in
his potent embraces. The four sons of Khadija died in their infancy. Maria,
his Egyptian concubine, was endeared to him by the birth of Ibrahim. At
the end of fifteen months the prophet wept over his grave; but he sustained
with firmness the raillery of his enemies, and checked the adulation or credulity
of the Moslems, by the assurance that an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned
by the death of the infant. Khadija had likewise given him four
daughters, who were married to the most faithful of his disciples; the three
eldest died before their father; but Fatima, who possessed his confidence
and love, became the wife of her cousin Ali, and the mother of an illustrious
progeny.</p>

<p>From his earliest youth, Mohammed was addicted to religious contemplation;
each year, during the month of Ramadhan, he withdrew from the world
and from the arms of Khadija; in the cave of Hira, three miles from Mecca,
he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is not in the
heavens but in the mind of the prophet. The faith which, under the name
of Islam, he preached to his family and nation, is compounded of an eternal
truth and a necessary fiction&mdash;that there is only one God, and that Mohammed
is the apostle of God.</p>

<p>The Christians of the seventh century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance
of paganism; their public and private vows were addressed to the
relics and images that disgraced the temples of the East; the throne of the
Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and saints, and angels, the
objects of popular veneration; and the Collyridian heretics, who flourished
in the fruitful soil of Arabia, invested the Virgin Mary with the name and
honours of a goddess. The creed of Mohammed is free from suspicion or
ambiguity; and the <i>Koran</i> is a glorious testimony to the unity of God.
The prophet of Mecca rejected the worship of idols and men, of stars and
planets, on the rational principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever
is born must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish. In
the author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm confessed and adored an
infinite and eternal being, without form or place, without issue or similitude,
present to our most secret thoughts, existing by the necessity of his own
nature, and deriving from himself all moral and intellectual perfection.
These sublime truths, thus announced in the language of the prophet, are
firmly held by his disciples, and defined with metaphysical precision by the
interpreters of the <i>Koran</i>. The first principle of reason and revelation was
confirmed by the voice of Mohammed; his proselytes, from India to Morocco,
are distinguished by the name of Unitarians; and the danger of idolatry has
been prevented by the interdiction of images. The doctrine of eternal decrees
and absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mohammedans;
and they struggle with the common difficulties, how to reconcile the prescience
of God with the freedom and responsibility of man; how to explain
the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite goodness.</p>

<p>The liberality of Mohammed allowed to his predecessors the same credit
which he claimed for himself; and the chain of inspiration was prolonged
from the fall of Adam to the promulgation of the <i>Koran</i>. During that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
period, some rays of prophetic light had been imparted to 124,000 of the
elect, discriminated by their respective measure of virtue and grace; 313
apostles were sent with a special commission to recall their country from
idolatry and vice; 104 volumes had been dictated by the holy spirit; and
six legislators of transcendent brightness have announced to mankind the
six successive revelations of various rites, but of one immutable religion.
The authority and station of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, and
Mohammed rise in just gradation above each other; but whosoever hates
or rejects any one of the prophets is numbered with the infidels. The
writings of the patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies of
the Greeks and Syrians; the conduct of Adam had not entitled him to the
gratitude or respect of his children; the seven precepts of Noah were
observed by an inferior and imperfect class of the proselytes of the synagogue,
and the memory of Abraham was obscurely revered by the Sabians
in his native land of Chaldea; of the myriads of prophets, Moses and
Christ alone lived and reigned; and the remnant of the inspired writings
was comprised in the books of the Old and the New Testament. The
miraculous story of Moses is consecrated and embellished in the <i>Koran</i>;
and the captive Jews enjoy the secret revenge of imposing their belief on the
nations whose recent creeds they deride. For the author of Christianity,
the Mohammedans are taught by the prophet to entertain a high and mysterious
reverence. “Verily, Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Apostle
of God, and His word, which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit proceeding
from him are honourable in this world, and in the world to come; and
He is one of those who approach near to the presence of God.” The piety
of Moses and of Christ rejoiced in the assurance of a future prophet, more
illustrious than themselves; the evangelic promise of the Paraclete, or Holy
Ghost, was prefigured in the name, and accomplished in the person, of
Mohammed, the greatest and the last of the apostles of God.</p>

<p>The inspiration of the Hebrew prophets, of the apostles and evangelists
of Christ, might not be incompatible with the exercise of their reason and
memory; and the diversity of their genius is strongly marked in the style
and composition of the books of the Old and New Testament. But Mohammed
was content with a character, more humble yet more sublime, of a simple
editor; the substance of the <i>Koran</i>, according to himself or his disciples,
is uncreated and eternal; subsisting in the essence of the Deity, and inscribed
with a pen of light on the table of his everlasting decrees. A paper copy,
in a volume of silk and gems, was brought down to the lowest heaven by the
angel Gabriel, who, under the Jewish economy, had indeed been despatched
on the most important errands; and this trusty messenger successively revealed
the chapters and verses to the Arabian prophet. Instead of a perpetual
and perfect measure of the divine will, the fragments of the <i>Koran</i>
were produced at the discretion of Mohammed; each revelation is suited to
the emergencies of his policy or passion; and all contradiction is removed
by the saving maxim that any text of Scripture is abrogated or modified by
any subsequent passage. The word of God, and of the apostle, was diligently
recorded by his disciples on palm leaves and the shoulder bones of mutton;
and the pages, without order or connection, were cast into a domestic chest
in the custody of one of his wives.</p>

<p>Two years after the death of Mohammed the sacred volume was collected
and published by his friend and successor Abu Bekr. The work was revised
by the caliph Othman, in the thirtieth year of the Hegira; and the various
editions of the <i>Koran</i> assert the same miraculous privilege of a uniform and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
incorruptible text. In the spirit of enthusiasm or vanity, the prophet rests
the truth of his mission on the merit of his book, audaciously challenges both
men and angels to imitate the beauties of a single page, and presumes to assert
that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance. This argument
is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian, whose mind is attuned to
faith and rapture, whose ear is delighted by the music of sounds, and whose
ignorance is incapable of comparing the productions of human genius. The
harmony and copiousness of style will not reach, in a version, the European
infidel; he will peruse with impatience the endless incoherent rhapsody of
fable, and precept, and declamation, which seldom excites a sentiment or an
idea, which sometimes crawls in the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds.
The divine attributes exalt the fancy of the Arabian missionary; but his
loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book of Job, composed
in a remote age, in the same country, and in the same language. If
the composition of the <i>Koran</i> exceed the faculties of a man, to what superior
intelligence should we ascribe the <i>Iliad</i> of Homer or the <i>Philippics</i> of
Demosthenes?</p>

<p>In all religions, the life of the founder supplies the silence of his written
revelation; the sayings of Mohammed were so many lessons of truth, his
actions so many examples of virtue; and the public and private memorials
were preserved by his wives and companions. At the end of two hundred
years the <i>sunna</i>, or oral law, was fixed and consecrated by the labours of Al-Buchari,
who discriminated 7,275 traditions, from a mass of 300,000 reports
of a more doubtful or spurious character. Each day the pious author prayed
in the temple of Mecca, and performed his ablutions with the water of Zemzem;
the pages were successively deposited on the pulpit and the sepulchre
of the apostle; and the work has been approved by the four orthodox
sects of the Sunnites.</p>

<p>The mission of the ancient prophets, of Moses, and of Jesus, had been confirmed
by many splendid prodigies; and Mohammed was repeatedly urged by
the inhabitants of Mecca and Medina to produce a similar evidence of his
divine legation; to call down from heaven the angel or the volume of his revelation,
to create a garden in the desert, or to kindle a conflagration in the unbelieving
city. As often as he is pressed by the demands of the Koreish, he
involves himself in the obscure boast of vision and prophecy, appeals to the
internal proofs of his doctrine, and shields himself behind the providence of
God, who refuses those signs and wonders that would depreciate the merit
of faith and aggravate the guilt of infidelity. But the modest or angry
tone of his apologies betrays his weakness and vexation; and these passages
of scandal establish, beyond suspicion, the integrity of the <i>Koran</i>.</p>

<p>The votaries of Mohammed are more assured than himself of his miraculous
gifts, and their confidence and credulity increase as they are further
removed from the time and place of his spiritual exploits. They believe or
affirm that trees went forth to meet him; that he was saluted by stones;
that water gushed from his fingers; that he fed the hungry, cured the sick,
and raised the dead; that a beam groaned to him; that a camel complained
to him; that a shoulder of mutton informed him of its being poisoned; and
that both animate and inanimate nature were equally subject to the apostle
of God. His dream of a nocturnal journey is seriously described as a real
and corporeal transaction. A mysterious animal, the borak, conveyed him
from the temple of Mecca to that of Jerusalem; with his companion Gabriel
he successively ascended the seven heavens, and received and repaid the salutations
of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the angels, in their respective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
mansions. Beyond the seventh heaven, Mohammed alone was permitted to
proceed; he passed the veil of unity, approached within two bow-shots of the
throne, and felt a cold that pierced him to the heart when his shoulder was
touched by the hand of God. After this familiar, though important conversation,
he again descended to Jerusalem, remounted the borak, returned to
Mecca, and performed in the tenth part of a night the journey of many
thousand years. According to another legend, the apostle confounded in a
national assembly the malicious challenge of the Koreish. His resistless
word split asunder the orb of
the moon; the obedient planet
stooped from her station in the
sky, accomplished the seven
revolutions round the Kaaba,
saluted Mohammed in the Arabian
tongue, and suddenly contracting
her dimensions entered
at the collar, and issued forth
through the sleeve of his shirt.
The vulgar are amused with
these marvellous tales; but the
gravest of the Mussulman doctors
imitate the modesty of their
master, and indulge a latitude
of faith or interpretation. They
might speciously allege that, in
preaching the religion, it was
needless to violate the harmony
of nature; that a creed unclouded
with mystery may be
excused from miracles; and that
the sword of Mohammed was
not less potent than the rod of
Moses.</p>

<p>The polytheist is oppressed
and distracted by the variety of
superstition; a thousand rites
of Egyptian origin were interwoven
with the essence of the
Mosaic law, and the spirit of
the Gospel had evaporated in the
pageantry of the church. The
prophet of Mecca was tempted,
by prejudice, or policy, or patriotism, to sanctify the rites of the Arabians and
the custom of visiting the holy stone of the Kaaba. But the precepts of
Mohammed himself inculcate a more simple and rational piety; prayer, fasting,
and alms are the religious duties of a Mussulman; and he is encouraged
to hope that prayer will carry him half-way to God, fasting will bring him to
the door of his palace, and alms will gain him admittance.</p>

<p>(1) According to the tradition of the nocturnal journey, the apostle, in
his personal conference with the Deity, was commanded to impose on his
disciples the daily obligation of fifty prayers. By the advice of Moses, he
applied for an alleviation of this intolerable burden; the number was gradually
reduced to five; without any dispensation of business or pleasure, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
time or place, the devotion of the faithful is repeated at daybreak, at noon, in
the afternoon, in the evening, and at the first watch of the night; and in the
present decay of religious fervour our travellers are edified by the profound
humility and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness is the key
of prayer; the frequent lustration of the hands, the face, and the body,
which was practised of old by the Arabs, is solemnly enjoined by the <i>Koran</i>;
and a permission is formally granted to supply with sand the scarcity of
water. The words and attitudes of supplication, as it is performed either
sitting, or standing, or prostrate on the ground, are prescribed by custom or
authority, but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent ejaculations;
the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious liturgy; and each Mussulman,
for his own person, is invested with the character of a priest. Among
the theists, who reject the use of images, it has been found necessary to
restrain the wanderings of the fancy by directing the eye and the thought
towards a <i>kibla</i>, or visible point of the horizon. The prophet was at first
inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem, but he soon returned
to a more natural partiality; and five times every day the eyes of the nations
at Astrakhan, at Fez, at Delhi are devoutly turned to the holy temple of
Mecca. Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure; the Mohammedans
indifferently pray in their chamber or in the street. As a distinction
from the Jews and Christians, the Friday in each week is set apart for the
useful institution of public worship; the people are assembled in the mosque;
and the imam, some respectable elder, ascends the pulpit, to begin the
prayer and pronounce the sermon. But the Mohammedan religion is destitute
of priesthood or sacrifice; and the independent spirit of fanaticism looks
down with contempt on the ministers and the slaves of superstition.</p>

<p>(2) The voluntary penance of the ascetics, the torment and glory of
their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions a rash
vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and sleep; and firmly declared
that he would suffer no monks in his religion. Yet he instituted, in each
year, a fast of thirty days; and strenuously recommended the observance,
as a discipline which purifies the soul and subdues the body, as a salutary
exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle. During the month
of Ramadhan, from the rising to the setting of the sun, the Mussulman
abstains from eating, and drinking, and women, and baths, and perfumes;
from all nourishment that can restore his strength, from all pleasure that
can gratify his senses. In the revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadhan
coincides by turns with the winter cold and the summer heat; and the
patient martyr, without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must
expect the close of a tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine,
peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits, is converted by Mohammed
alone into a positive and general law; and a considerable portion of the
globe has abjured, at his command, the use of that salutary though dangerous
liquor. These painful restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the libertine
and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legislator by whom they are enacted
cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the indulgence of
their sensual appetites.</p>

<p>(3) The charity of the Mohammedans descends to the animal creation;
and the <i>Koran</i> repeatedly inculcates, not as a merit but as a strict and indispensable
duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortunate. Mohammed, perhaps,
is the only lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity;
the standard may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it consists
either in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the Mussulman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
does not accomplish the law unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue;
and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth, under the
idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth. Benevolence is the foundation of
justice, since we are forbidden to injure those whom we are bound to assist.
A prophet may reveal the secrets of heaven and of futurity; but in his
moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts.</p>

<p>The two articles of belief and the four practical duties of Islam are
guarded by rewards and punishments; and the faith of the Mussulman is
devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day. The prophet
has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful catastrophe, though
he darkly announces the signs, both in heaven and earth, which will precede
the universal dissolution, when life shall be destroyed and the order of
creation shall be confounded in the primitive chaos. At the blast of the
trumpet, new worlds will start into being; angels, genii, and men will arise
from the dead, and the human soul will again be united to the body. The
doctrine of the resurrection was first entertained by the Egyptians; and
their mummies were embalmed, their pyramids were constructed, to preserve
the ancient mansion of the soul during a period of three thousand years.
But the attempt is partial and unavailing; and it is with a more philosophic
spirit that Mohammed relies on the omnipotence of the Creator, whose word
can reanimate the breathless clay, and collect the innumerable atoms that no
longer retain their form or substance. The intermediate state of the soul
it is hard to decide; and those who most firmly believe in her immaterial
nature, are at a loss to understand how she can think or act without the
agency of the organs of sense.</p>

<p>The reunion of the soul and body will be followed by the final judgment
of mankind; and in his copy of the magian picture the prophet has too
faithfully represented the forms of proceeding, and even the slow and successive
operations of an earthly tribunal. By his intolerant adversaries he
is upbraided for extending, even to themselves, the hope of salvation; for
asserting the blackest heresy&mdash;that every man who believes in God and
accomplishes good works may expect in the last day a favourable sentence.
Such rational indifference is ill adapted to the character of a fanatic; nor
is it probable that a messenger from heaven should depreciate the value and
necessity of his own revelation. In the idiom of the <i>Koran</i>, the belief of
God is inseparable from that of Mohammed; the good works are those
which he has enjoined; and the two qualifications imply the profession of
Islam, to which all nations and all sects are equally invited. Their spiritual
blindness, though excused by ignorance and crowned with virtue, will be
scourged with everlasting torments; and the tears which Mohammed shed
over the tomb of his mother, for whom he was forbidden to pray, display a
striking contrast of humanity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The doom of the infidels is common; the measure of their guilt and
punishment is determined by the degree of evidence which they have
rejected, by the magnitude of the errors which they have entertained; the
eternal mansions of the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the Magians, and
the idolaters are sunk below each other in the abyss; and the lowest hell is
reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed the mask of religion.
After the greater part of mankind has been condemned for their opinions,
the true believers only will be judged by their actions. The good and evil
of each Mussulman will be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance,
and a singular mode of compensation will be allowed for the payment
of injuries; the aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good actions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
for the benefit of the person whom he has wronged; and if he should be
destitute of any moral property, the weight of his sins will be loaded with
an adequate share of the demerits of the sufferer. According as the shares
of guilt or virtue shall preponderate, the sentence will be pronounced, and
all, without distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the
abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mohammed, will gloriously
enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty will fall into the first
and mildest of the seven hells. The term of expiation will vary from nine
hundred to seven thousand years; but the prophet has judiciously promised
that all his disciples, whatever may be their sins, shall be saved, by their
own faith and his intercession, from eternal damnation.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that superstition should act most powerfully on the
fears of her votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more energy
the misery than the bliss of a future life. With the two simple elements
of darkness and fire we create a sensation of pain, which may be aggravated
to an infinite degree by the idea of endless duration. But the same idea
operates with an opposite effect on the continuity of pleasure; and too
much of our present enjoyment is obtained from the relief, or the comparison
of evil. It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell
with rapture on the groves, the fountains, and the rivers of paradise; but
instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste for harmony
and science, conversation and friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and
diamonds, the robes of silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gold, rich wines,
artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of sensual and
costly luxury which becomes insipid to the owner, even in the short period
of this mortal life. Seventy-two houris, or black-eyed girls, of resplendent
beauty, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility will be
created for the use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will be
prolonged to a thousand years, and his faculties will be increased a hundredfold,
to render him worthy of his felicity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice, the gates of heaven will be open to
both sexes; but Mohammed has not specified the male companions of the
female elect, lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their former husbands,
or disturb their felicity by the suspicion of an everlasting marriage.
This image of a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the
envy, of the monks; they declaim against the impure religion of Mohammed;
and his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures and
allegories. But the sounder and more consistent party adheres, without
shame, to the literal interpretation of the <i>Koran</i>; useless would be the
resurrection of the body, unless it were restored to the possession and exercise
of its worthiest faculties; and the union of sensual and intellectual
enjoyment is requisite to complete the happiness of the double animal, the
perfect man. Yet the joys of the Mohammedan paradise will not be confined
to the indulgence of luxury and appetite; and the prophet has expressly
declared that all meaner happiness will be forgotten and despised by
the saints and martyrs, who shall be admitted to the beatitude of the divine
vision.</p>

<p>The talents of Mohammed are entitled to our applause; but his success has
perhaps too strongly attracted our admiration. Are we surprised that a
multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an
eloquent fanatic? In the heresies of the church the same seduction has
been tried and repeated from the time of the apostles to that of the reformers.
Does it seem incredible that a private citizen should grasp the sword<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
and the sceptre, subdue his native country, and erect a monarchy by his victorious
arms? In the moving picture of the dynasties of the East, a hundred
fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser origin, surmounted more formidable
obstacles, and filled a larger scope of empire and conquest.</p>

<p>Mohammed was alike instructed to preach and to fight, and the union of
these opposite qualities, while it enhanced his merit, contributed to his success;
the operation of force and persuasion, of enthusiasm and fear, continually
acted on each other, till every barrier yielded to their irresistible power.
His voice invited the Arabs to freedom and victory, to arms and rapine, to the
indulgence of their darling passions in this world and the other; the restraints
which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of the prophet and
to exercise the obedience of the people; and the only objection to his success
was his rational creed of the unity and perfections of God.</p>

<p>It is not the propagation but the permanency of his religion that deserves
our wonder; the same pure and perfect impression which he engraved at
Mecca and Medina is preserved after the revolutions of twelve centuries by
the Indian, the African, and the Turkish proselytes of the <i>Koran</i>. If the
Christian apostles, St. Peter or St. Paul, could return to the Vatican, they
might possibly inquire the name of the deity who is worshipped with such
mysterious rites in that magnificent temple; at Oxford or Geneva, they
would experience less surprise, but it might still be incumbent on them to
peruse the catechism of the church and to study the orthodox commentators
on their own writings and the words of their master. But the Turkish dome
of St. Sophia, with an increase of splendour and size, represents the humble
tabernacle erected at Medina by the hands of Mohammed. The Mohammedans
have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their faith
and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man. “I believe
in one God, and Mohammed the apostle of God,” is the simple and invariable
profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been
degraded by any visible idol; the honours of the prophet have never transgressed
the measure of human virtue; and his living precepts have restrained
the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion. The
votaries of Ali have indeed consecrated the memory of their hero, his wife,
and his children, and some of the Persian doctors pretend that the divine
essence was incarnate in the person of the imams; but their superstition is
universally condemned by the Sunnites, and their impiety has afforded a
seasonable warning against the worship of saints and martyrs.</p>

<p>The metaphysical questions on the attributes of God and the liberty of
man have been agitated in the schools of the Mohammedans, as well as in
those of the Christians; but among the former they have never engaged the
passions of the people or disturbed the tranquillity of the state. The cause
of this important difference may be found in the separation or union of the
regal and sacerdotal characters. It was the interest of the caliphs, the successors
of the prophet and commanders of the faithful, to repress and discourage
all religious innovations; the order, the discipline, the temporal and
spiritual ambition of the clergy are unknown to the Moslems, and the sages
of the law are the guides of their conscience and the oracles of their faith.
From the Atlantic to the Ganges the <i>Koran</i> is acknowledged as the fundamental
code, not only of theology but of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and
the laws which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are guarded
by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of God. This religious
servitude is attended with some practical disadvantage; the illiterate
legislator had been often misled by his own prejudices and those of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
country; and the institutions of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the
wealth and numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these occasions,
the kadi respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and substitutes
a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the principles of equity and the
manners and policy of the times.</p>

<p>His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is the last
consideration in the character of Mohammed. The most bitter or most bigoted
of his Christian or Jewish foes will surely allow that he assumed a false
commission to inculcate a salutary doctrine, less perfect only than their own.
He piously supposed, as the basis of his religion, the truth and sanctity of
their prior revelations, the virtues and miracles of their founders. The idols
of Arabia were broken before the throne of God; the blood of human victims
was expiated by prayer, and fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts
of devotion; and his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted
by the images most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation. Mohammed
was, perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and political system for
the use of his countrymen; but he breathed among the faithful a spirit of
charity and friendship, recommended the practice of the social virtues, and
checked, by his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge and the oppression of
widow and orphans. The hostile tribes were united in faith and obedience,
and the valour which had been idly spent in domestic quarrels was vigorously
directed against a foreign enemy. Had the impulse been less powerful,
Arabia, free at home and formidable abroad, might have flourished under
a succession of her native monarchs. Her sovereignty was lost by the extent
and rapidity of conquest. The colonies of the nation were scattered over the
East and West, and their blood was mingled with the blood of their converts
and captives. After the reign of three caliphs, the throne was transported
from Medina to the valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris;
the holy cities were violated by impious war; Arabia was ruled by the rod of
a subject, perhaps of a stranger; and the Bedouins of the desert, awakening
from their dream of dominion, resumed their old and solitary independence.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_4d"><a href="#parthians_endnote_4d">d</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V. THE SPREAD OF ISLAM</h3>

<h4>ABU BEKR, FIRST CALIPH AFTER MOHAMMED</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[632-661 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Mohammed, the founder of the Saracenic empire, died at Medina, on
Monday the 8th of June, 632 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, being the twenty-second year of the
reign of Heraclius the Grecian emperor. After he was dead, the next care
was to appoint a successor; and it was indeed very necessary that one should
be provided as soon as possible. Their government and religion being both
in their infancy, and a great many of Mohammed’s followers no great
bigots, not having yet forgotten their ancient rights and customs, but rather
forced to leave them for fear, than upon any conviction, affairs were in such
a posture as could by no means admit of an interregnum. Wherefore the
same day that he expired the Mussulmans met together in order to elect a
caliph or successor. In that assembly there had like to have been such
a fray, as might, in all probability, have greatly endangered, if not utterly
ruined, this new religion and polity, had not Omar and Abu Bekr timely
interposed. For the prophet having left no positive directions concerning a
successor, or at least none that were known to any but his wives, who in all
probability might conceal them out of their partiality in favour of Omar, a
hot dispute arose between the inhabitants of Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p>At last Omar being wearied out, and seeing no likelihood of deciding the
matter, was willing to give over, and bade Abu Bekr give him his hand,
which he had no sooner done than Omar promised him fealty. The rest
followed his example, and by the consent of both parties Abu Bekr was at
last saluted caliph, and being acknowledged the rightful successor of their
prophet Mohammed, became the absolute judge of all causes both sacred and
civil. Thus, after much ado, that difference was at last composed, which
had like to have proved fatal to Mohammedanism. And certainly it was a
very great oversight in Mohammed, in all the time of his sickness, never to
have named a successor positively and publicly. If he had done so, without
question, his authority would have determined the business, and prevented
that disturbance which had like to have endangered the religion he had
planted with so much difficulty and hazard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Now though the government was actually settled upon Abu Bekr, all
parties were not equally satisfied, for a great many were of opinion that the
right of succession belonged to Ali, the son of Abu Talib. Upon which
account the Mohammedans have ever since been divided; some maintaining
that Abu Bekr, and Omar, and Othman, that came after him, were the rightful
and lawful successors of the prophet; and others disclaiming them altogether
as usurpers, and constantly asserting the right of Ali. Of the former
opinion are the Turks at this day; of the latter, the Persians. And such consequently
is the difference between those two nations, that notwithstanding their
agreement in all other points of their superstition, yet upon this account
they treat one another as most damnable heretics. Ali had this to recommend
him, that he was Mohammed’s cousin-german, and was the first that
embraced his religion, except his wife Khadija, and his slave Zaid, and
was besides Mohammed’s son-in-law, having married his daughter Fatima.
Abu Bekr was Mohammed’s father-in-law, by whom he was so much respected
that he received from him the surname of As-Siddik (which signifies
in Arabic, “a great speaker of truth”), because he resolutely asserted the
truth of that story which Mohammed told of his going one night to heaven.</p>

<p>Ali was not present at this election, and when he heard the news was not
well pleased, having hoped that the choice would have fallen on himself.
Abu Bekr sent Omar to Fatima’s house, where Ali and some of his friends
were, with orders to compel them by force to come in and do fealty to him,
if they would not be persuaded by fair means. Omar was just going to
fire the house, when Fatima asked him what he meant. He told her that
he would certainly burn the house down unless they would be content to do
as the rest of the people had done. Upon which Ali came forth and went
to Abu Bekr, and acknowledged his sovereignty.</p>

<p>Abu Bekr being thus settled in his new government, had work enough to
maintain it; for the Mohammedan religion had not as yet taken such deep
root in the hearts of men but that they would very willingly have shaken it
off had they known how. Accordingly the Arabians, a people of a restless
and turbulent disposition, did not neglect the opportunity of rebelling, which
they thought was fairly offered them by the death of Mohammed. Immediately
taking up arms, they refused to pay the usual tribute, tithes, and alms, and
no longer observed the rites and customs which had been imposed upon
them by Mohammed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[632-633 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Abu Bekr sent Khalid ben Walid, with an army of forty-five hundred
men, who, having routed them in a set battle, brought off a great deal of
plunder, and made slaves of their children.</p>

<p>Khalid was the best general of his age, and it was chiefly to his courage
and conduct that the Saracens owed the subduing of the rebels, the conquest
of Syria, and the establishment of their religion and polity. His love and
tenderness towards his own soldiers were only equalled by his hatred
and aversion to the enemies of the Mohammedan religion. Of both he has
given the most signal instances. To those who, having embraced the
Mohammedan religion, afterwards apostatised, he was an irreconcilable and
implacable foe; nor would he spare them, though they evinced the greatest
signs of unfeigned repentance. For his great valour, the Arabs called him
“the Sword of God”; which surname of his was known also to his enemies,
and is mentioned as well by Greek as Arab authors.</p>

<p>About this time several persons, perceiving the success and prosperity of
Mohammed and his followers, set up also for prophets too, in hope of meeting
the like good fortune, and making themselves eminent in the world. Such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
were Aswad al-Ansi and Tulaihah ben Khuwailid, with several others, whose
attempts however quickly came to nothing. But the most considerable
of these impostors was Musailima, who had been the rival of Mohammed
even in his life-time, and trumped up a book in imitation of the <i>Koran</i>. He
had now gathered together a very considerable body of men in Yemen,
a province of Arabia, and began to be so formidable that the Mussulmans
began to feel alarmed at his growing greatness.</p>

<p>It is strange and surprising to consider from how mean and contemptible
beginnings the greatest things have been raised in a short time. Of this the
Saracenic empire is a remarkable instance. For if we look back but eleven
years, we shall see how Mohammed, unable to support his cause, routed and
oppressed by the powerful party of the Koreishites at Mecca, fled with a few
desponding followers to Medina to preserve his life no less than his imposture.
And now, within so short a period, we find the undertakings of his
successor prospering beyond expectation, and making him the terror of all
his neighbours; and the Saracens in a capacity not only to keep possession
of their own peninsula of Arabia, but to extend their arms over larger territories
than ever were subject to the Romans themselves. Whilst they were
thus employed in Arabia, they were little regarded by the Grecian emperor,
who awoke too late to a sense of their formidable power, when he saw them
pouring in upon them like a torrent, and driving all before them. The
proud Persian, too, who so very lately had been domineering in Syria, and
sacked Jerusalem and Damascus, must be forced not only to part with his
own dominions, but also to submit his neck to the Saracenic yoke. It may
be reasonably supposed that, had the Grecian empire been in the flourishing
condition it formerly was, the Saracens might have been checked at least, if
not entirely extinguished. But besides that the western part of the empire
had been rent from it by the barbarous Goths, the eastern also had received
so many shocks from the Huns on the one side, and the Persians on the
other, that it was not in a situation to stem the fury of this powerful invasion.
Heraclius, indeed, was a prince of admirable courage and conduct,
and did all that was possible to restore the discipline of the army, and was
very successful against the Persians, not only driving them out of his own
dominions, but even wresting from them a part of their own territories. But
the empire seemed to labour under an incurable disease, and to be wounded
in its very vitals. No time could have been more fatally adverse to its
maintenance, nor more favourable to the enterprises of the Saracens.</p>

<p>Abu Bekr had now set affairs at home in pretty good order. The apostates
who upon the death of Mohammed had revolted to the idolatry in which
they were born and bred, were again reduced to subjection. The forces of
Musailima, the false prophet, being dispersed and himself killed, there was
now little or nothing left to be done in Arabia. For though there were a
great many Christian Arabs, as particularly the tribe of Ghassan, yet they
were generally employed in the service of the Greek emperor. The next
business, therefore, that the caliph had to do, pursuant to the tenor of his religion,
was to make war upon his neighbours, for the propagation of the
truth (for so they call their superstition), and compel them either to become
Mohammedans or tributaries. For their prophet Mohammed had given them
a commission of a very large, nay, unlimited extent, to fight, <i>viz.</i>, till all the
people were of his religion. The wars which are entered upon in obedience
to this command, they call holy wars, with no greater absurdity than we
ourselves give the same title to that which was once undertaken against them
by Europeans. With this religious object, Abu Bekr sent at this time a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
force under Khalid into Irak or Babylonia; but his greatest longing was
after Syria, which delicious, pleasant, and fruitful country being near to
Arabia, seemed to lie very conveniently for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[633-634 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The news of his preparation quickly came to the ears of the emperor
Heraclius, who despatched a force with all possible speed to check the advance
of the Saracens, but with ill success; for the general, with twelve
hundred of his men, was killed upon the field of the battle, and the rest
routed, the Arabs losing only 120 men. A number of skirmishes followed,
in most of which the Christians came off the worst.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5b1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5b">b</a></span></p>

<p>Damascus was besieged for months, and all sorties of the inhabitants
crushed with heavy slaughter. Heraclius, at Antioch, sent a great army
under Werdan to its relief. Khalid, raising the siege, went to meet it.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p148.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Damascus</span></p>
</div>

<p>The two armies presently came within sight of each other, and the
confidence of the Saracens was somewhat checked, when they perceived
the strength of the emperor’s forces, which amounted to no less than seventy
thousand. Those who had been in Persia, and seen the vast armies of
Chosroes, confessed that they had never beheld an enemy equal to the present,
either in number or military preparation. On the second morning they
moved forward, and engaged in all parts with all imaginable vigour. The
fight, or rather the slaughter, continued till evening. The Christian army
was entirely routed and defeated. The Saracens killed that day fifty thousand
men. Those that escaped fled, some of them to Cæsarea, others to
Damascus, and some to Antioch. The Saracens took plunder of inestimable
value, and a great many banners, and crosses made of gold and silver,
precious stones, silver and gold chains, rich clothes, and arms without number;
which Khalid said he would not divide until Damascus was taken.</p>

<p>The Saracens, returning to Damascus, continued vigorously to press the
siege, and reduced the inhabitants to very great straits, who every day made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
a worse defence. For a while, at last, they begged of Khalid to stay the
assault, that they might have a little time to deliberate. But he turned a
deaf ear to them, for he had rather take the town by force, and put the
inhabitants to the sword, and let his Saracens have the plunder, than that
they should surrender, and have security for their lives and their property.
At length, through treachery, Khalid entered at the east gate with his Saracens,
putting all to the sword, and Christian blood streamed down the streets
of Damascus.</p>

<p>Abu Bekr the caliph died the same day that Damascus was taken,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
which was on Friday, the 23rd of August, 634 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> There are various
reports concerning his death; some say that he was poisoned by the Jews,
eating rice with Harith ben Kaldah, and that they both died of it within a
twelvemonth after. But Aisha says, that he bathed himself upon a cold
day, which threw him into a fever<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of which he died within fifteen days.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5b2"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5b">b</a></span></p>

<p>Abu Bekr particularly lamented the number of the prophet’s companions
that fell in these campaigns, and fearing that the revelations of Mohammed
might be dispersed and lost, he gave orders that they should be collected
into the <i>Koran</i>. We shall later have occasion to notice the slovenly manner
in which the persons employed performed their task; the compilation was
subsequently revised in the reign of the caliph Othman, and it is probable
that there are many passages far different from those which Mohammed
wrote.</p>

<p>When all things were ready, the caliph reviewed the troops and issued
that celebrated code of regulations for the conduct of the army; it was
addressed to the general Abu Sufyan, and contained the following directions:
“Take care to treat your men with tenderness and lenity. Consult
with your officers upon all pressing occasions, and encourage them to face
the enemy with bravery and resolution. If you are victorious, spare all the
aged, the women, and the children. Neither cut down palm trees nor burn
any fields of corn. Spare all fruit trees; slay no cattle but such as are
required for your own use. Adhere to your engagements inviolably; spare
the inhabitants of monasteries; desecrate no houses of religious worship.
Cleave the skulls of those members of the synagogue of Satan, who shave
their crowns, give them no quarter, unless they embrace Islamism, or pay
tribute.”</p>

<p>The character of the first caliph had a beneficial effect on the Mohammedan
religion; for though the partisans of Ali accuse him of ambition,
and of uniting with his daughter Aisha to suppress the prophet’s declarations
in favour of Ali, yet they do not deny him the praise of disinterestedness,
justice, and benevolence. Before his accession, he had bestowed the
greater part of his estate to feed the poor, and had been publicly named
by the prophet the most charitable of men. When placed at the head of
affairs, he only took from the treasury the sum absolutely necessary for his
daily support; before entering on the sovereignty, he ordered an exact
account to be taken of his personal estate, and at his death it was found to
be considerably diminished. In fact the absolute ruler of the richest countries
of the world left behind him but a single camel and an Ethiopian slave,
and even these he bequeathed to his successor. He dictated his will to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Othman in the following terms: “<i>In the Name of the Most Merciful God.</i>&mdash;This
is the last will and testament of Abu Bekr ben Abi Kohafa, when he
was in the last hour of this world, and the first of the next; an hour in
which the infidel must believe, the wicked be convinced of their evil ways,
and liars speak the truth. I nominate Omar ben al-Khattab my successor;
therefore, hearken to him, and obey him. If he acts right, he will confirm
my expectations; if otherwise, he must render an account of his own
actions. My intentions are good, but I cannot foresee the future results.
However, those who do ill shall render a severe account hereafter. Fare-ye-well.
May ye be ever attended by the divine favour and blessing.” When
Abu Bekr had concluded this dictation, he fainted; on his recovery, he
desired Othman to read the document, soon after which he expired. When
information of the event was brought to Omar, he exclaimed, “The life of Abu
Bekr has been such, that it will be impossible for those who come after, to
imitate his sublime example.” Two proverbs attributed to him, deserve
to be quoted: “Good actions are a sure protection against the blows of
adversity.”&mdash;“Death is the most difficult of all things before it comes, and
the easiest when it is past.”</p>

<h4>THE CALIPH OMAR</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[634-644 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Omar was, like his predecessor, a native of Mecca; he had been originally
a camel-herd, and never became quite free from the coarseness and rusticity
incident to his humble origin. At first a zealous idolater, he proposed to
extirpate all the followers of Mohammed; when he became afterwards a
Mussulman, he was just as eager to massacre all who would not believe in the
prophet. Violent on every occasion, he breathed nothing but slaughter;
and countless anecdotes are related of his unrelenting temper. One of these
must suffice. A Mussulman having a suit against a Jew, was condemned by
Mohammed, and in consequence, carried his appeal before the tribunal of
Omar; scarcely had he stated his case, when Omar, springing from his seat,
struck the appellant dead with one blow of his sabre, exclaiming, “So perish
all who will not submit to the decision of God’s chosen prophet.” Rigorous
justice, as interpreted by the Mohammedan laws, and extreme severity, rendered
his character more respected than beloved. Mohammed said of him,
“Truth speaks by the mouth of Omar.” He added, that “if God had to
send another prophet on the earth, Omar would be the object of his
choice.”</p>

<p>When Abu Bekr informed Omar that he had chosen him as his successor,
Omar, with mingled pride and humility, answered, “I have no need of the
caliphate.” Abu Bekr replied, “But the caliphate has need of you,” and thus
removed all further scruple. On his accession, he called himself the “Caliph
of the Caliph of God’s apostle,” but finding the title inconveniently long, he
changed it into that of “Commander of the Faithful”; and this became,
subsequently, the favourite designation of his successors. When first he
addressed his subjects, he stood a step lower on the pulpit than Abu Bekr
had been accustomed to do; he informed his hearers that he would not
have undertaken the arduous task of government, only that he reposed perfect
confidence in their intention to observe the law, and adhere to the
pure faith; he concluded with these remarkable words, “O Mussulmans,
I take God to witness, that none of you shall be too strong for me to sacrifice
the rights of the weak, nor too weak for me to neglect the rights of
the strong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>No sooner was Omar placed at the head of affairs than the armies of the
Mohammedans seemed to have acquired tenfold vigour; and this was not
diminished by the severe treatment which the gallant Khalid, for a trivial
offence, received from the jealous caliph. The greater part of Syria and
Mesopotamia had been subdued during the life of Abu Bekr, the conquest of
these countries was now completed; the ancient empire of the Persians was
overthrown at the battle of Kadisiya; Palestine, Phœnicia, and Egypt submitted
to the Saracen yoke almost without a struggle; and the standard of
the prophet floated in triumph from the sands of the Cyrenian desert to the
banks of the Indus. “During the reign of Omar,” says Khondemir, “the Saracens
conquered thirty-six thousand cities, towns, and castles, destroyed
four thousand Christian, Magian, and pagan temples, and erected fourteen
hundred mosques.”</p>

<p>The annals of the world present no parallel to this recital; the Arabs
were animated by an enthusiasm which made them despise the most fearful
odds; they had ever in their mouths the magnificent orientalism, traditionally
ascribed to Mohammed, “in the shades of the scymitars is paradise
prefigured”; they sought battle as a feast, and counted danger a sport. A
fiercer spirit of course displayed itself in the Mohammedan creed; the sanguinary
precepts of propagandism, to which the prophet had given utterance
after his power was established at Medina, quite obscured the milder doctrine
taught at Mecca; and even these were surpassed in ferocity by traditions
which some of the sterner enthusiasts declared that they had derived
from the prophet himself. Abu Horeira declared that he heard from
Mohammed, “He who shall die without having fought for God, or who never
proposed that duty to himself, verily consigns himself to destruction by his
hypocrisy,” and also the singular declaration, “He who shall bestow a horse
upon one who would enlist himself under the banner of the Most High, and
be one who has faith in God and in his promises, surely, both the food of that
horse and the sustenance of his rider, with the ordure of the former, shall
be placed in the scales for his advantage on the day of judgment.” We
shall add one more, preserved on the authority of Ibn Abbas: “There are two
descriptions of eyes which the fire of hell shall not destroy; the eyes that
weep in contemplating the indignation of God, and the eyes which are
closed when in the act of combat for the cause of God.”<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5f1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5f">f</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CONQUEST OF PERSIA</h4>

<p>From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will naturally
arise, that the first caliphs commanded in person the armies of the faithful,
and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks of the battle. The
courage of Abu Bekr, Omar, and Othman had indeed been tried in the
persecution and wars of the prophet; and the personal assurance of paradise
must have taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present
world. But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age, and
esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most important duties
of a sovereign. Except the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem,
their longest expeditions were the frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca;
and they calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached
before the sepulchre of the prophet.</p>

<p>In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus, the succeeding princes
of the house of Omayyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and of saints. Yet the spoils of unknown nations were continually laid
at the foot of their throne, and the uniform ascent of the Arabian greatness
must be ascribed to the spirit of the nation rather than the abilities of their
chiefs. A large deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies.
The birth of Mohammed was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and
disorderly period of the Persians, the Romans, and the barbarians of Europe;
the empires of Trajan, or even of Constantine or Charlemagne, would have
repelled the assault of the naked Saracens, and the torrent of fanaticism
might have been obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.</p>

<p>In the victorious days of the Roman republic, it had been the aim
of the senate to confine their consuls and legions to a single war, and completely
to suppress a first enemy before they provoked the hostilities of a
second. These timid maxims of policy were disdained by the magnanimity
or enthusiasm of the Arabian caliphs. With the same vigour and success they
invaded the successors of Augustus, and those of
Artaxerxes; and the rival monarchies at the same
instant became the prey of an enemy whom they
had been so long accustomed to despise. One hundred
years after Mohammed’s flight from Mecca,
the arms and the reign of his successors extended
from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over the various
and distant provinces which may be comprised
under the names of, (1) Persia; (2) Syria; (3)
Egypt; (4) Africa; and (5) Spain. Under this
general division we may proceed to unfold these
memorable transactions; despatching with brevity
the remote and less interesting conquests of the
East, and reserving a fuller narrative for those
domestic countries, which had been included within
the pale of the Roman Empire.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">[634-637 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the first year of the first caliph, his lieutenant
Khalid, the sword of God, and the scourge of the
infidels, advanced to the banks of the Euphrates,
and reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira. Westward
of the ruins of Babylon a tribe of sedentary
Arabs had fixed themselves on the verge of the
desert; and Hira was the seat of a race of kings
who had embraced the Christian religion, and
reigned above six hundred years under the shadow
of the throne of Persia. The last of the Mondars
was defeated and slain by Khalid; his son was sent
a captive to Medina; his nobles bowed before the
successor of the prophet; the people were tempted
by the example and success of their countrymen;
and the caliph accepted as the first-fruits of foreign
conquest, an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold. The conquerors,
and even their historians, were astonished by the dawn of their
future greatness.</p>

<p>The indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment their
intestine divisions. By the unanimous sentence of the priests and nobles,
Queen Azarmidokht was deposed&mdash;the sixth of the transient usurpers who
had arisen and vanished in three or four years, since the death of Chosroes
and the retreat of Heraclius. Her tiara was placed on the head of Yezdegerd,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the grandson of Chosroes; and the same era, which coincides with an
astronomical period, has recorded the fall of the Sassanian dynasty and the
religion of Zoroaster. The youth and inexperience of the prince&mdash;he was
only fifteen years of age&mdash;declined a perilous encounter; the royal standard
was delivered into the hands of his general Rustem; and a remnant of thirty
thousand regular troops was swelled in truth, or in opinion, to 120,000 subjects,
or allies, of the great king. The Moslems, whose numbers were
reinforced from twelve to thirty thousand, had pitched their camp in the
plains of Kadesiya; and their line, though it consisted of fewer men, could
produce more soldiers than the unwieldy host of the infidels. The periods
of the battle of Kadesiya were distinguished by their peculiar appellations.
The first, from the well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian
brethren, was denominated the day of succour. The day of concussion might
express the disorder of one, or perhaps of both, of the contending armies.
The third, a nocturnal tumult, received the whimsical name of the night of
barking, from the discordant clamours, which were compared to the
inarticulate sounds of the fiercest animals.</p>

<p>The morning of the succeeding day determined the fate of Persia; and
a seasonable whirlwind drove a cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers.
The clangour of arms was re-echoed to the tent of Rustem, who, far
unlike the ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool and
tranquil shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of mules that
was laden with gold and silver. On the sound of danger he started from
his couch; but his flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab, who caught him
by the foot, struck off his head, hoisted it on a lance, and instantly returning
to the field of battle, carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest
ranks of the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss of 7,500 men; and the
battle of Kadesiya is justly described by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious.
The standard of the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the
field&mdash;a leathern apron of a blacksmith, who, in ancient times, had arisen
the deliverer of Persia; but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised,
and almost concealed, by a profusion of precious gems. After this victory,
the wealthy province of Irak or Assyria submitted to the caliph, and his conquests
were firmly established by the speedy foundation of Bassora, a place
which ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[637-651 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After the defeat of Kadesiya, a country intersected by rivers and canals
might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the victorious cavalry; and the
walls of Ctesiphon or Madain, which had resisted the battering-rams of
the Romans, would not have yielded to the darts of the Saracens. But the
flying Persians were overcome by the belief that the last day of their religion
and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were abandoned by treachery or
cowardice; and the king, with a part of his family and treasures, escaped to
Holwan at the foot of the Median hills. In the third month after the battle,
Said, the lieutenant of Omar, passed the Tigris without opposition; the
capital was taken by assault; and the disorderly resistance of the people
gave a keener edge to the sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with religious
transport, “This is the white palace of Chosroes, this is the promise of the
apostle of God!” The naked robbers of the desert were suddenly enriched
beyond the measure of their hope or knowledge. Each chamber revealed a
new treasure secreted with art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and
silver, the various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says Abulfeda)
the estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian defines the
untold and almost infinite mass by the fabulous computation of three thousands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of thousands of thousands of pieces of gold. The sack of Ctesiphon
was followed by its desertion and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked
the air and situation of the place, and Omar was advised by his general to
remove the seat of government to the western side of the Euphrates.</p>

<p>In every age the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian cities has been easy
and rapid; the country is destitute of stone and timber, and the most solid
structures are composed of bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement
of the native bitumen. After the loss of the battle of Jalula, Yezdegerd fled
from Holwan, and concealed his shame and despair in the mountains of Farsistan,
from whence Cyrus had descended with his equal and valiant companions.
The courage of the nation survived that of the monarch; among
the hills to the south of Ecbatana or Hamadan, 150,000 Persians made a third
and final stand for their religion and country; and the decisive battle of
Nehavend was styled by the Arabs the “victory of victories” (641).</p>

<p>The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and Latins;
but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more ancient than the invasion
of the Arabs. By the reduction of Hamadan and Ispahan, of Caswin,
Tabriz, and Rei, they gradually approached the shores of the Caspian Sea;
and the orators of Mecca might applaud the success and spirit of the faithful,
who had already lost sight of the Northern Bear, and had almost transcended
the bounds of the habitable world. Again turning towards the
west and the Roman Empire, they repassed the Tigris over the bridge of
Mosul, and, in the captive provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced
their victorious brethren of the Syrian army. From the palace of Madain their
eastern progress was not less rapid or extensive. They advanced along
the Tigris and the gulf; penetrated through the passes of the mountains
into the valley of Estachar or Persepolis; and profaned the last sanctuary
of the Magian empire. The grandson of Chosroes was nearly surprised
among the falling columns and mutilated figures; a sad emblem of the past
and present fortune of Persia; he fled with accelerated haste over the desert of
Kirman, implored the aid of the warlike Segestans, and sought an humble
refuge on the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power. But a victorious
army is insensible of fatigue; the Arabs divided their forces in the pursuit
of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the government of
Khorasan to the first general who should enter that large and populous
country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians. The condition was
accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard of Mohammed was planted
on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balkh; and the successful leader neither
halted nor reposed till his foaming cavalry had tasted the waters of the
Oxus. In the public anarchy, the independent governors of the cities and
castles obtained their separate capitulations; the terms were granted or imposed
by the esteem, the prudence, or the compassion of the victors; and a
simple profession of faith established the distinction between a brother and
a slave. The administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of
the people, the cattle, and the fruits of the earth; and this monument, which
attests the vigilance of the caliphs, might have instructed the philosophers of
every age.</p>

<p>The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus, and as far as
the Jaxartes, two rivers of ancient and modern renown, which descend from
the mountains of India towards the Caspian Sea. He was hospitably entertained
by Tarkhan, prince of Fergana, a fertile province on the Jaxartes;
the king of Samarcand, with the Turkish tribes of Sogdiana and Scythia,
were moved by the lamentations and promises of the fallen monarch; and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
solicited by a suppliant embassy, the more solid and powerful friendship of
the emperor of China. The virtuous Taitsong, the first of the dynasty of the
Tang, may be justly compared with the Antonines of Rome. His people
enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and peace, and his dominion was acknowledged
by forty-four hordes of the barbarians of Tartary. His last
garrisons of Cashgar and Khoten maintained a frequent intercourse with
their neighbours of the Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony of Persians had
introduced into China the astronomy of the magi; and Taitsong might be
alarmed by the rapid progress and dangerous vicinity of the Arabs. The
influence and perhaps the supplies of China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd
and the zeal of the worshippers of the fire; and he returned with an army
of Turks to conquer the inheritance of his fathers. The fortunate Moslems,
without unsheathing their swords, were the spectators of his ruin and death.
The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his servant, insulted by the seditious
inhabitants of Merou, and oppressed, defeated, and pursued by his
barbarian allies. He reached the banks of a river, and offered his rings and
bracelets for an instant passage in a miller’s boat. Ignorant or insensible of
royal distress, the rustic replied, that four drachms of silver were the daily
profit of his mill, and that he would not suspend his work unless the loss
were repaid. In this moment of hesitation and delay, the last of the Sassanian
kings was overtaken and slaughtered by the Turkish cavalry in the
nineteenth year of his unhappy reign. His son Firuz, an humble client of
the Chinese emperor, accepted the station of captain of his guards; and the
magian worship was long preserved by a colony of loyal exiles in the
province of Bokhara. His grandson inherited the regal name; but after a
faint and fruitless enterprise, he returned to China and ended his days in
the palace of Sigan. The male line of the Sassanids was extinct; but the
female captives, the daughters of Persia, were given to the conquerors in
servitude, or marriage; and the race of the caliphs and imams was ennobled
by the blood of their royal mothers.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Persian kingdom, the river Oxus divided the territories
of the Saracens and of the Turks. This narrow boundary was soon
overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs; the governors of Khorasan extended
their successive inroads; and one of their triumphs was adorned with the
buskin of a Turkish queen, which she dropped in her precipitate flight
beyond the hills of Bokhara. But the final conquest of Transoxiana, as well
as of Spain, was reserved for the glorious reign of the inactive Walid; and
the name of Katiba, the camel driver, declares the origin and merit of his successful
lieutenant. While one of his colleagues displayed the first Mohammedan
banner on the banks of the Indus, the spacious regions between the
Oxus, the Jaxartes, and the Caspian Sea, were reduced by the arms of Katiba
to the obedience of the prophet, and of the caliph. A tribute of two
millions of pieces of gold was imposed on the infidels; their idols were burned
or broken; the Mussulman chief pronounced a sermon in the new mosque of
Khwarizm; after several battles, the Turkish hordes were driven back to the
desert; and the emperors of China solicited the friendship of the victorious
Arabs.</p>

<p>Before the invasion of the Saracens, Khwarizm, Bokhara and Samarcand
were rich and populous under the yoke of the shepherds of the north. The
mutual wants of India and Europe were supplied by the diligence of the
Sogdian merchants; and the inestimable art of transforming linen into paper,
has been transferred from the manufacture of Samarcand over the western
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<h4>THE SYRIAN CONQUEST COMPLETED</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[636-637 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the conquest of Damascus the Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis
and Emesa. In the prosecution of the war, their policy was not less
effectual than their sword. By short and separate truces they dissolved the
union of the enemy; accustomed the Syrians to compare their friendship
with their enmity; familiarised the idea of their language, religion, and
manners; and exhausted, by clandestine purchase, the magazines and arsenals
of the cities which they returned to besiege. They aggravated the ransom of
the more wealthy or the more obstinate; and Chalcis alone was taxed at
five thousand ounces of gold, five thousand ounces of silver, two thousand
robes of silk, and as many figs and olives as would load five thousand asses.
But the terms of truce or capitulation were faithfully observed; and the
lieutenant of the caliph, who had promised not to enter the walls of the captive
Baalbec, remained tranquil and immovable in his tent till the jarring
factions solicited the interposition of a foreign master. The conquest of the
plain and valley of Syria was achieved in less than two years. Yet the commander
of the faithful reproved
the slowness of their progress,
and the Saracens, bewailing their
fault with tears of rage and repentance,
called aloud on their
chiefs to lead them forth to fight
the battles of the Lord.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p156.jpg" width="300" height="175" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Saracenic Glazed Jug and Lamp</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was incumbent on the Saracens
to exert the full powers
of their valour and enthusiasm
against the forces of the emperor,
who was taught by repeated
losses, that the rovers of the desert had undertaken, and would speedily
achieve, a regular and permanent conquest. From the provinces of Europe
and Asia, fourscore thousand soldiers were transported by sea and land to
Antioch and Cæsarea; the light troops of the army consisted of sixty thousand
Christian Arabs of the tribes of Ghassan. In the neighbourhood
of Bosra, the springs of Mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of
Decapolis, or ten cities; and the Hieromax, a name which has been corrupted
to Yermuk, is lost after a short course in the lake of Tiberias. The banks
of this obscure stream were illustrated by a long and bloody encounter. On
this momentous occasion, the public voice, and the modesty of Abu Obaidah,
restored the command to the most deserving of the Moslems. Khalid
assumed his station in the front, his colleague was posted in the rear, that
the disorder of the fugitives might be checked by his venerable aspect and
the sight of the yellow banner which Mohammed had displayed before the
walls of Khaibar.</p>

<p>The last line was occupied by the sister of Derar, with the Arabian women
who had enlisted in this holy war, who were accustomed to wield the bow
and the lance, and who in a moment of captivity had defended, against the
uncircumcised ravishers, their chastity and religion. The exhortation of
the generals was brief and forcible: “Paradise is before you, the devil and
hell-fire in your rear.” Yet such was the weight of the Roman cavalry,
that the right wing of the Arabs was broken and separated from the main
body. Thrice did they retreat in disorder, and thrice were they driven
back to the charge by the reproaches and blows of the women. Four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field of battle; and the
skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven hundred to boast that they had
lost an eye in that meritorious service. The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged
that it was the hardest and most doubtful of the days which they
had seen. But it was likewise the most decisive; many thousands of the
Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were slaughtered,
after the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many, by mistaking the
ford, were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk; and however the loss may
be magnified, the Christian writers confess and bewail the bloody punishment
of their sins.</p>

<p>After the battle of Yermuk, the Roman army no longer appeared in the
field; and the Saracens might securely choose, among the fortified towns of
Syria, the first object of their attack. They consulted the caliph whether
they should march to Cæsarea or Jerusalem; and the advice of Ali determined
the immediate siege of the latter. To a profane eye, Jerusalem was
the first or second capital of Palestine; but after Mecca and Medina, it
was revered and visited by the devout Moslems, as the temple of the Holy
Land, which had been sanctified by the revelation of Moses, of Jesus, and of
Mohammed himself.</p>

<p>The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months; not a day was lost without
some action of sally or assault; the military engines incessantly played from
the ramparts; and the inclemency of the winter was still more painful and
destructive to the Arabs. The Christians yielded at length to the perseverance
of the besiegers. The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls, and
by the voice of an interpreter demanded a conference. After a vain attempt
to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph from his impious enterprise, he proposed,
in the name of the people, a fair capitulation, with this extraordinary
clause, that the articles of security should be ratified by the authority and
presence of Omar himself. The question was debated in the council of
Medina; the sanctity of the place, and the advice of Ali, persuaded the caliph
to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and enemies, and the simplicity of Omar’s
journey is more illustrious than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression.
The conqueror of Persia and Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried,
besides his person, a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish, and a
leathern bottle of water. By his command the ground of the temple of Solomon
was prepared for the foundation of a mosque; and, during a residence of
ten days, he regulated the present and future state of his Syrian conquests.
Medina might be jealous, lest the caliph should be detained by the sanctity of
Jerusalem or the beauty of Damascus; her apprehensions were dispelled by
his prompt and voluntary return to the tomb of the apostle.</p>

<p>To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war, the caliph had formed
two separate armies; a chosen detachment, under Amru and Yazid, was left
in the camp of Palestine; while the larger division, under the standard of
Abu Obaidah and Khalid, marched away to the north against Antioch and
Aleppo. The castle of Aleppo, distinct from the city, stood erect on a lofty
artificial mound, and the sides were sharpened to a precipice, and faced with
freestone. After the loss of three thousand men, the garrison was still equal
to the defence. In a siege of four or five months, the hardest of the Syrian
war, great numbers of the Saracens were killed and wounded. The exhortation
of the commander of the faithful, not to give up the siege, was responded
to by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of Arabia, who arrived in the
camp on horses or camels. Among these was Dames, of a servile birth, but
of gigantic size and intrepid resolution. At the darkest hour of the night he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
scaled the most accessible height, a place where the stones were less entire, or
the slope less perpendicular, or the guard less vigilant. Seven of the stoutest
Saracens mounted on each other’s shoulders and the weight of the column
was sustained on the broad and sinewy back of the gigantic slave.</p>

<p>The foremost in this painful ascent could grasp and climb the lowest part
of the battlements; they silently stabbed and cast down the sentinels; and the
thirty brethren, repeating a pious ejaculation, “O apostle of God, help and
deliver us!” were successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans.
They overpowered the guard, unbolted the gate, let down the drawbridge,
and defended the narrow pass till the arrival of Khalid, with the dawn of
day, relieved their danger and assured their conquest. After the loss of this
important post, and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies, the luxury of
Antioch trembled and obeyed. Her safety was ransomed with three hundred
thousand pieces of gold; but the throne of the successors of Alexander, the
seat of the Roman government in the East, which had been decorated by Cæsar
with the titles of free, and holy, and inviolate, was degraded under the yoke
of the caliphs to the secondary rank of a provincial town.</p>

<p>The loss of Damascus and Jerusalem, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and
Yermuk, may be imputed in some degree to the absence or misconduct of
the sovereign. Instead of defending the sepulchre of Christ, he involved the
church and state in a metaphysical controversy for the unity of his will;
and while Heraclius crowned the offspring of his second nuptials, he was
tamely stripped of the most valuable part of their inheritance. In the cathedral
of Antioch, in the presence of the bishops, at the foot of the crucifix, he
bewailed the sins of the prince and people; but his confession instructed
the world, that it was vain, and perhaps impious, to resist the judgment
of God. The Saracens were invincible in fact, since they were invincible
in opinion. After bidding an eternal farewell to Syria, Heraclius secretly
embarked with a few attendants, and absolved the faith of his subjects.
From the north and south the Saracen troops of Antioch and Jerusalem
advanced along the seashore, till their banners were joined under the walls
of the Phœnician cities; Tripolis and Tyre were betrayed; and a fleet of
fifty transports, which entered without distrust the captive harbours, brought
a seasonable supply of arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens.
Their labours were terminated by the unexpected surrender of Cæsarea.
The remainder of the province, Ramlah, Ptolemais or Acre, Nablus or
Neapolis, Gaza, Askalon, Berytus, Sidon, Gabala, Laodicea, Apamea, Hierapolis,
no longer presumed to dispute the will of the conqueror; and Syria
bowed under the sceptre of the caliphs, seven hundred years after Pompey
had despoiled the last of the Macedonian kings.</p>

<p>The sieges and battles of six campaigns had consumed many thousands
of the Moslems. They died with the reputation and the cheerfulness of
martyrs; and the simplicity of their faith may be expressed in the words of an
Arabian youth, when he embraced, for the last time, his sister and mother;
“It is not,” said he, “the delicacies of Syria, or fading delights of this world,
that have prompted me to devote my life in the cause of religion. But I
seek the favour of God and his apostle; and I have heard from one of the
companions of the prophet, that the spirits of the martyrs will be lodged in
the crops of green birds, who shall taste the fruits, and drink of the rivers
of paradise. Farewell, we shall meet again among the groves and fountains
which God has provided for his elect.”</p>

<p>The more fortunate Arabs who survived the war, and persevered in the
faith, were restrained by their abstemious leader from the abuse of prosperity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
After a refreshment of three days, Abu Obaidah withdrew his
troops from the pernicious contagion of the luxury of Antioch, and assured
the caliph that their religion and virtue could only be preserved by the hard
discipline of poverty and labour. The year of their triumph was marked
by a mortality of men and cattle; and twenty-five thousand Saracens were
snatched away from the possession of Syria. The death of Abu Obaidah
might be lamented by the Christians; but his brethren recollected that he
was one of the ten elect, whom the prophet had named heirs of paradise.
Khalid survived his brethren about three years; and the tomb of the Sword
of God is shown near Emesa. His valour, which founded in Arabia and
Syria the empire of the caliphs, was fortified by the opinion of a special
providence; and as long as he wore a cap which had been blessed by Mohammed
he deemed himself invulnerable amidst the darts of the infidels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[637-640 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The place of the first conquerors was supplied by a new generation of
their children and countrymen; Syria became the seat and support of the
house of Omayyah; and the revenue, the soldiers, the ships of that powerful
kingdom, were consecrated to enlarge on every side the empire of the
caliphs. But the Saracens despise a superfluity of fame; and their historians
scarcely condescend to mention the subordinate conquests which
are lost in the splendour and rapidity of their victorious career. To the north
of Syria, they passed Mount Taurus, and reduced to their obedience the
province of Cilicia, with its capital Tarsus, the ancient monument of the
Assyrian kings. Beyond a second ridge of the same mountains, they spread
the flame of war, rather than the light of religion, as far as the shores of the
Euxine and the neighbourhood of Constantinople. To the east they advanced
to the banks and sources of the Euphrates and Tigris; the long-disputed
barrier of Rome and Persia was forever confounded; the walls of Edessa
and Amida, of Dara and Nisibis, which had resisted the arms and engines
of Sapor or Nushirvan, were levelled in the dust; and the holy city of Abgarus
might vainly produce the epistle or the image of Christ to an unbelieving
conqueror. To the west the Syrian kingdom is bounded by the sea; and
the ruin of Aradus, a small island or peninsula on the coast, was postponed
during ten years. But the hills of Libanus abounded in timber; the trade
of Phœnicia was populous in mariners; and a fleet of seventeen hundred
barks was equipped and manned by the natives of the desert. The imperial
navy of the Romans fled before them from the Pamphylian rocks to the
Hellespont; but the spirit of the emperor, a grandson of Heraclius, had
been subdued before the combat by a dream and a pun. The Saracens rode
masters of the sea; and the islands of Cyprus, Rhodes, and the Cyclades,
were successively exposed to their rapacious visits. Three hundred years
before the Christian era, the memorable, though fruitless siege of Rhodes,
by Demetrius, had furnished that maritime republic with the materials and
the subject of a trophy. A gigantic statue of Apollo, or the sun, seventy
cubits in height, was erected at the entrance of the harbour, a monument of
the freedom and the arts of Greece. After standing fifty-six years, the
Colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake; but the massy trunk,
and huge fragments, lay scattered eight centuries on the ground, and are
often described as one of the wonders of the ancient world. They were collected
by the diligence of the Saracens, and sold to a Jewish merchant of
Edessa, who is said to have laden nine hundred camels with the weight of the
brass metal: an enormous weight, though we should include the hundred
colossal figures, and the three thousand statues which adorned the prosperity
of the city of the sun.</p>

<h4>EGYPT CAPTURED (639 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[639-654 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The conquest of Egypt may be explained by the character of the victorious
Saracen, one of the first of his nation in an age when the meanest of the
brethren was exalted above his nature by the spirit of enthusiasm. The
birth of Amru was at once base and illustrious; his reason or his interest
determined him to renounce the worship of idols; he escaped from Mecca
with his friend Khalid, and the prophet of Medina enjoyed at the same moment
the satisfaction of embracing the two firmest champions of his cause.
His merit was not overlooked by the first two successors of Mohammed;
they were indebted to his arms for the conquest of Palestine; and in all
the battles and sieges of Syria, he united with the temper of a chief the
valour of an adventurous soldier.</p>

<p>From his camp, in Palestine, Amru had surprised or anticipated the
caliph’s leave for the invasion of Egypt. The magnanimous Omar trusted in
his God and his sword, which had shaken the thrones of Chosroes and Cæsar;
but when he compared the slender force of the Moslems with the greatness
of the enterprise, he condemned his own rashness and listened to his
timid companions. At the head of only four thousand Arabs, the intrepid
Amru had marched away from his station of Gaza when he was overtaken
by the messenger of Omar. “If you are still in Syria,” said the ambiguous
mandate, “retreat without delay; but if, at the receipt of this epistle,
you have already reached the frontiers of Egypt, advance with confidence,
and depend on the succour of God and of your brethren.” The
experience, perhaps the secret intelligence, of Amru had taught him to
suspect the mutability of courts; and he continued his march till his tents
were unquestionably pitched on Egyptian ground. He there assembled his
officers, broke the seal, perused the epistle, gravely inquired the name and
situation of the place, and declared his ready obedience to the commands of
the caliph.</p>

<p>After a siege of thirty days, he took possession of Farmah or Pelusium,
and that key of Egypt, as it has been justly named, unlocked the entrance
of the country, as far as the ruins of Heliopolis and the neighbourhood of
the modern Cairo.</p>

<p>On the western side of the Nile, at a small distance to the east of the
pyramids, at a small distance to the south of the Delta, Memphis, 150 furlongs
in circumference, displayed the magnificence of ancient kings. The
siege was protracted to seven months; and the rash invaders were encompassed
and threatened by the inundation of the Nile. Their last assault was
bold and successful; they passed the ditch, which had been fortified with
iron spikes, applied their scaling-ladders, entered the fortress with the shout
of “God is victorious!” and drove the remnant of the Greeks to their boats,
and the isle of Rouda. The spot was afterwards recommended to the conqueror
by the easy communication with the gulf and the peninsula of
Arabia; the remains of Memphis were deserted; the tents of the Arabs
were converted into permanent habitations, and the first mosque was blessed
by the presence of fourscore companions of Mohammed. A new city arose
in their camp on the eastward bank of the Nile. But the name of Cairo,
the town of victory, more strictly belongs to the modern capital, which was
founded in the tenth century by the Fatimite caliphs. It has gradually
receded from the river; but the continuity of buildings may be traced by
an attentive eye from the monuments of Sesostris [Ramses II] to those of
Saladin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Yet the Arabs, after a glorious and profitable enterprise, must have
retreated to the desert, had they not found a powerful alliance in the heart
of the country.</p>

<p>The persecution of the emperors had converted a sect into a nation, and
alienated Egypt from their religion and government. The Saracens were
received as the deliverers of the Jacobite church; and a secret and effectual
treaty was opened during the siege of Memphis between a victorious army
and a people of slaves. A rich and noble Egyptian of the name of Mukawkas,
had dissembled his faith to obtain the administration of his province;
in the disorders of the Persian War he aspired to independence; the embassy
of Mohammed ranked him among princes; but he declined, with rich gifts
and ambiguous compliments, the proposal of a new religion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Cairo</span></p>
</div>

<p>In his first conference with Amru, he heard without indignation the
usual option of the <i>Koran</i>, the tribute or the sword; and he cheerfully
submitted to pay tribute and obedience to his temporal successors. The
tribute was ascertained at two pieces of gold for the head of every Christian;
but old men, monks, women, and children of both sexes, under sixteen years of
age, were exempted from this personal assessment. At the pressing summons
of Amru, their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his desert; and, after the
first interview, the courteous Arab affected to declare that he had never
conversed with a Christian priest of more innocent manners and a more
venerable aspect. In the march from Memphis to Alexandria, the lieutenant
of Omar entrusted his safety to the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians;
the roads and bridges were diligently repaired; and in every step of his
progress, he could depend on a constant supply of provisions and intelligence.
The Greeks of Egypt, whose numbers could scarcely equal a tenth of the
natives, were overwhelmed by the universal defection; they had ever been
hated, they were no longer feared; the magistrate fled from his tribunal, the
bishop from his altar; and the distant garrisons were surprised or starved
by the surrounding multitudes. Had not the Nile afforded a safe and ready
conveyance to the sea, not an individual could have escaped who, by birth,
or language, or office, or religion, was connected with their odious name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>By the retreat of the Greeks from the provinces of Upper Egypt, a considerable
force was collected in the island of Delta; the natural and artificial
channels of the Nile afforded a succession of strong and defensible posts;
and the road to Alexandria was laboriously cleared by the victory of the
Saracens in two-and-twenty days of general or partial combat. In their
annals of conquest, the siege of Alexandria is perhaps the most arduous and
important enterprise. The first trading city in the world was abundantly
replenished with the means of subsistence and defence. Her numerous
inhabitants fought for the dearest of human rights, religion and property;
and the enmity of the natives seemed to exclude them from the common
benefit of peace and toleration. The sea was continually open; and if Heraclius
had been awake to the public distress, fresh armies of Romans and barbarians
might have been poured into the harbour to save the second capital
of the empire.</p>

<p>In every attack, the sword, the banner of Amru, glittered in the van of
the Moslems. On a memorable day, he was betrayed by his imprudent
valour: his followers who had entered the citadel were driven back; and
the general, with a friend and a slave, remained a prisoner in the hands of the
Christians. When Amru was conducted before the prefect, he remembered
his dignity and forgot his situation; a lofty demeanour and resolute
language revealed the lieutenant of the caliph, and the battle-axe of a soldier
was already raised to strike off the head of the audacious captive. His life
was saved by the readiness of his slave, who instantly gave his master a blow
on the face, and commanded him, with an angry tone, to be silent in the
presence of his superiors. The credulous Greek was deceived; he listened
to the offer of a treaty, and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a
more respectable embassy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced
the return of their general, and insulted the folly of the infidels. At length,
after a siege of fourteen months, and the loss of three-and-twenty thousand
men, the Saracens prevailed.</p>

<p>The commander of the faithful rejected with firmness the idea of pillage,
and directed his lieutenant to reserve the wealth and revenue of Alexandria
for the public service and the propagation of the faith; the inhabitants were
numbered; a tribute was imposed; the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites
were curbed, and the Melchites, who submitted to the Arabian yoke, were
indulged in the obscure but tranquil exercise of their worship. The intelligence
of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted the declining health
of the emperor; and Heraclius died of a dropsy about seven weeks after the
loss of Alexandria.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Under the minority of his grandson, the clamours of a
people deprived of their daily sustenance compelled the Byzantine court to
undertake the recovery of the capital of Egypt. In the space of four years,
the harbour and fortifications of Alexandria were twice occupied by a fleet
and army of Romans. They were twice expelled by the valour of Amru,
who was recalled by the domestic peril from the distant wars of Tripolis and
Nubia. But the facility of the attempt, the repetition of the insult, and the
obstinacy of the resistance provoked him to swear that, if a third time he
drove the infidels into the sea, he would render Alexandria as accessible on
all sides as the house of a prostitute. Faithful to his promise, he dismantled
several parts of the walls and towers, but the people were spared in the
chastisement of the city, and the mosque of Mercy was erected on the spot
where the victorious general had stopped the fury of his troops.</p>

<h4>THE ALLEGED BURNING OF THE LIBRARY</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[641 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>We should deceive the expectation of the reader if we passed in silence
the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described by the learned Abul-Faraj.
The spirit of Amru was more curious and liberal than that of
his brethren, and in his leisure hours the Arabian chief was pleased with the
conversation of John, the last disciple of Ammonius, and who derived the
surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and philosophy.
Emboldened by this familiar intercourse, Philoponus presumed to
solicit a gift, inestimable in his opinion, contemptible in that of the barbarians&mdash;the
royal library, which alone among the spoils of Alexandria had not
been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror. Amru was
inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his rigid integrity refused
to alienate the minutest object without the consent of the caliph; and the
well-known answer of Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic:
“If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless
and need not be preserved; if they disagree, they are pernicious, and
ought to be destroyed.” The sentence was executed with blind obedience;
the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand
baths of the city; and such was their incredible multitude, that six months
was barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious fuel. Since the
<i>Dynasties</i> of Abul-Faraj have been given to the world in a Latin version,
the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every scholar, with pious indignation,
has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and
the genius of antiquity.</p>

<p>For our own part, we are strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the
consequences. The fact is indeed marvellous. “Read and wonder!”
says the historian himself; and the solitary report of a stranger, who wrote at
the end of six hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the
silence of two annalists of a more early date, both Christians, both natives of
Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the patriarch Eutychius, has amply
described the conquest of Alexandria. The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant
to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mohammedan casuists: they
expressly declare that the religious books of the Jews and Christians, which
are acquired by the right of war, should never be committed to the flames;
and that the works of profane science, historians or poets, physicians or
philosophers, may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. A more
destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mohammed;
yet, in this instance, the conflagration would have speedily expired in
the deficiency of materials. We shall not recapitulate the disasters of the
Alexandrian library, the involuntary flame that was kindled by Cæsar in his
own defence, or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who studied to
destroy the monuments of idolatry.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But if we gradually descend from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius, we shall learn from a chain of
contemporary witnesses that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no
longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred thousand volumes, which
had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of the Ptolemies.
Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a
repository of books; but if the ponderous mass of Arian and monophysite
controversy were indeed consumed in the public baths, a philosopher may
allow, with a smile, that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind.
We sincerely regret the more valuable libraries which have been involved in
the ruin of the Roman Empire; but when we seriously compute the lapse
of ages, the waste of ignorance, and the calamities of war, our treasures,
rather than our losses, are the object of our surprise. Many curious and
interesting facts are buried in oblivion; the three great historians of Rome
have been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are deprived
of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and dramatic poetry of the
Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember that the mischances of time
and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage of antiquity
had adjudged the first place of genius and glory; the teachers of ancient
knowledge who are still extant had perused and compared the writings of
their predecessors; nor can it fairly be presumed that any important truth,
any useful discovery in art or nature, has been snatched away from the curiosity
of modern ages.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arabic Weapons</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the administration of Egypt, Amru balanced the demands of justice
and policy. In the management of the revenue he disapproved the simple
but oppressive mode of a capitation, and preferred with reason a proportion
of taxes, deducted on every branch from the clear profits of agriculture and
commerce. A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual repairs
of the dikes and canals, so essential to the public welfare. Under this
administration the fertility of Egypt supplied the dearth of Arabia; and a
string of camels, laden with corn and provisions, covered almost without an
interval the long road from Memphis to Medina. But the genius of Amru
soon renewed the maritime communication which had been attempted or
achieved by the Pharaohs, the Ptolemies, or the Cæsars; and a canal, at least
eighty miles in length, was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea. This inland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
navigation, which would have joined the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean,
was soon discontinued as useless and dangerous: the throne was removed
from Medina to Damascus; and the Grecian fleets might have explored a
passage to the holy cities of Arabia.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5g1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5g">g</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[637-644 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Amru, being now possessed of Egypt, began to look a little further
towards the western part of Africa; and in a short time made himself master
of all that country which lies between Barcah and Zeweilah. Shortly after
this he took Tripolis. If we consider the extent of his success, it alone is
great enough to command our admiration even though nothing else had been
accomplished in any other part. But in the East, also, the victorious
arms made no less progress, and the Mohammedan crescent now began to
shed its malignant influence upon as large and considerable dominions as
the Roman eagle ever soared over. About this time, Aderbaijan, Ainwerdah,
Harran, Roha, Rakkah, Nisibin, Ehwaz, Siwas, and Khorasan were all brought
under subjection to the Saracens.</p>

<p>About two years after this, Omar, the caliph, was killed. The account
of his death is as follows: One Firuz, a Persian, of the sect of the magi, or
Parsees, as being of a different religion from the Mussulmans, had a daily
tribute of two pieces of silver imposed upon him by his master, and made his
complaint to Omar, demanding to have a part of it remitted. Omar told
him he did not think it at all unreasonable, considering he could well afford
it out of what he earned. With his answer Firuz was so provoked that he
did as good as threaten the caliph to his face, who, however, took little notice
of his passion. Firuz watched his opportunity; and not long after, whilst
Omar was saying the morning prayer in the mosque, stabbed him thrice in
the belly with a dagger. The Saracens in the mosque rushing upon him
immediately, he made a desperate defence, and stabbed thirteen of them, of
whom seven died. At last, one that stood by threw his vest over him, and
seized him; when, perceiving himself caught, he stabbed himself. Omar
lived three days after the wound, and then died, in the month of Dhul-haj,
in the twenty-third year of the Hegira, 644 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, after he had reigned ten
years, six months, and eight days, and was sixty-three years old; which
is the same age at which, according to some authors, Mohammed, Abu Bekr,
and Aisha, Mohammed’s wife, died.</p>

<p>The conquests gained by the Saracens in his reign were so considerable
that, though they had never been extended, the countries they had subdued
would have made a very formidable empire. He drove all the Jews and
Christians out of Arabia; subdued Syria, Egypt, and other territories in
Africa, besides the greater part of Persia. And yet all this greatness, which
would have been too weighty for an ordinary man to bear, especially if, as in
Omar’s case, it did not descend to him as an hereditary possession, for which
he had been prepared by a suitable education, but was gotten on a sudden
by men who had been acquainted with, and used to, nothing great before,
had no effect upon the caliph.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5b3"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5b">b</a></span></p>

<p>Neither splendid victories nor extensive dominions changed the stern
character of Omar; he still preserved the rustic simplicity of his manners
and his ancient contempt for luxurious ornament. When he departed from
Medina to receive the submission of Jerusalem, he was mounted on a red
camel, having for his entire equipage two sacks, one containing corn and the
other fruit; before him was a leathern vessel of water, and behind him a large
platter from which he used to take his meals. In this guise he travelled the
entire road from Medina to Jerusalem, punishing the Mussulmans who led a
scandalous life, and providing for a rigorous administration of justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>On his arrival, the inhabitants prepared a splendid palace for his reception;
but he refused to enter the city, and had a tent erected outside the walls. In
this tent the deputies found the master of their destinies sitting on the
naked earth. The terms granted to the citizens of Jerusalem are remarkable
for their moderation; the security of the persons and properties of the inhabitants
was guaranteed, the free exercise of religion permitted, and the
churches allowed to remain with their present possessors. Even when the
caliph was anxious to erect a mosque, he requested the patriarch to point
him out an appropriate situation; that prelate led him to the spot where
Solomon’s temple once stood, which was then covered with filth, and the
caliph readily accepted the ground as it was. He himself set the example
of clearing the rubbish; the army followed with eager emulation, and the
mosque of Omar, erected on this spot, is one of the most beautiful specimens
of Arabian architecture. But though tolerant to the Christians, the caliph
showed himself severe to those of his own followers who had departed from
the rigour of the national manners. Having learned that some of his men
wore flowing robes of silk, he ordered them to be extended on the earth,
with their faces to the ground, and their silken robes to be torn from their
shoulders. He punished with the bastinado those convicted of drinking wine;
he made proclamation that those who had transgressed, should accuse themselves,
and such was the influence he possessed over his troops, that many
voluntarily confessed their guilt, and submitted to the degrading punishment.</p>

<p>In the history of Mohammedanism, Omar is a person second only in importance
to the founder of Islam. His strict severity was useful at a time
when unprecedented success seemed to excuse military violence; his impartiality
greatly abated the calamities of the conquest. He did not spare the
gallant Khalid, but it is probable that, in his conduct to that hero, he was
actuated more by jealousy than by a love of justice; it must however be
added, that in no instance did he permit high station to shelter oppressors.
A curious circumstance, characteristic of the age, is recorded. Omar carried
a cane with which he personally chastised officers even of the highest rank,
whom he detected in any guilty action, and hence arose the proverb, “Omar’s
cane is more terrible than the sword of the bravest warrior.”</p>

<p>His strictness in enforcing religious ordinances was carried to the very
extreme of fanaticism; by his orders the splendid library which the Ptolemies
had collected in Alexandria, was said to have been burned to heat the public
baths; and the invaluable records of Persia, assembled by the zeal of the
Sassanides in Madain, were hurled into the waters of the Tigris. His early
education had rendered him insensible to the charms of literature or art;
when his generals sent him, from the palace of the Persian kings, an unrivalled
piece of tapestry, representing a flower garden, worked with gold and precious
stones, he ordered this elaborate piece of workmanship to be cut in pieces,
and the fragments distributed to his soldiers. For his own use, he had
neither palace, nor court, nor house; during the time of prayer, he publicly
officiated in the mosque; the remainder of the day he spent in the streets
and squares, and it was there he gave audience to the ambassadors of the
most powerful cotemporary princes. His dress was not better than that of
his meanest subjects; when reproached for the deficiencies of his appearance,
he replied, “I would rather please the Lord by my conduct, than men by
my dress.” He was more indiscriminate in his charity than Abu Bekr;
the first caliph relieved none whose distress had been occasioned by vicious
conduct, Omar gave to all who asked. When reproached for making no
distinction, he replied, “Man is placed upon the earth, only to do good to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
brethren; the judgment of man’s worthiness should be left to his Creator.”
The temperance of Omar was as remarkable as his simplicity; his ordinary
food was coarse barley bread seasoned with salt, and on days of abstinence
the salt was laid aside; his only beverage was water. When at meals, he
invited all who chanced to be present, to take a share.</p>

<p>But the splendour of his public works was a strange contrast to the meanness
of his private life. We have already mentioned the mosque he caused to
be erected in Jerusalem; he also greatly enlarged and beautified that which
Mohammed had built in Medina. By his orders, the foundations were laid
of cities that rapidly grew to greatness, Old Cairo, Cufa, and Bassora. He
caused the canal between the Nile and the Red Sea to be repaired and opened,
in order to facilitate the importation of corn into Arabia, which the recent
enlargement of the cities had rendered a matter of prime necessity. It was
Omar, who first introduced the custom of dating from the Hegira; before
his time the Arabians dated from the last great event which had interested
the whole nation,&mdash;a war, a famine, or a plague,&mdash;and thus rendered their
chronology a mass of inextricable confusion. To him also is owing the
institution of a police force in Mecca and Medina, the establishment of a fund
to provide for the pay of the army, and the preparation of an equitable scale
of rewards for those who had distinguished themselves in the propagation of
Islam. It is no wonder that, with such claims to admiration, the name
of Omar should be so celebrated among the most rigid sects of the Mohammedans.
But while the Sunnites labour to extend the fame of Omar, his
memory is detested by the partisans of Ali; his name is the proverbial
expression for all that is base in the countries where the Shiite principles
prevail; no person that bears it, dare own it in public; and to such excess
do the Persians carry their hatred, that they celebrate the day of Omar’s
assassination as a public festival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[644 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Omar, finding death approaching, was at a loss whom to nominate his successor;
and, to remedy the difficulty, devised the most extraordinary expedient
that can be imagined. He directed that a council of six should be
assembled after his death, that three days should be allowed them for deliberation,
and that if, at the end of that time, they had not agreed on a new
caliph, they should all be slain. The six who met to deliberate under these
circumstances, were Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Mohammed, Othman, likewise
his son-in-law, Zobair, the cousin of the prophet, and Abd ar-Rahman,
Talha, and Saad, his favourite companions. After some deliberation, they
elected Othman, and he was installed third caliph.</p>

<h4>OTHMAN, THE THIRD CALIPH</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[644-656 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Othman was, like his predecessors, a native of Mecca, sprung from a
different branch of the same tribe that had given birth to the prophet. He
married successively two daughters of Mohammed, long acted as his secretary,
and enjoyed his intimate confidence. It is said, that Mohammed was
so delighted with the generosity displayed by his secretary, that he exclaimed,
“O my God, I am satisfied with Othman, be thou also satisfied with
him.” On another occasion, seeing Othman approach, he covered his face
with his robe, and said, “Should not I be ashamed before a man whose
merits would put angels to the blush?” At the time of his accession, he
was more than eighty years of age, but his health was unshaken, and the
vigour of his faculties unabated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>The third caliph pursued the warlike policy of his predecessors; by his
orders the Mussulman armies completed the conquest of Persia, and extended
the sway of the Saracens to the river Oxus, and the borders of India.
Northern Africa, as far as the shores of the Atlantic, was subdued by another
army; and a fleet, equipped in the harbours of Egypt and Syria, subdued
the island of Cyprus, and menaced the northern coasts of the Mediterranean.
But this success produced its natural effect; it required all the energies of
Omar’s stern character to resist the progress of luxury and dissipation; the
weak Othman was utterly incapable of any similar exertion. The wild sons of
the desert began to rival in magnificence the most wealthy monarchs; they
became ambitious of palaces and titles, they preferred the splendour of the
court, to the glory of the field. Othman’s gentleness and facility accelerated
the progress of corruption; naturally generous, he was unwilling to refuse
any applicant, and as the foremost candidates for office are generally those
least fitted for its duties, the administration fell into the hands of the designing
and the profligate. With some show of reason, the old companions of
Mohammed complained that they were set aside to make room for the family
of Othman; and, with still more justice, that the imprudence and wantonness
of youth was preferred to their experience.</p>

<p>Religion did not escape from the general corruption; new sects began to
be formed; and the jealousy of the partisans of Ali daily acquired fresh
strength. Abu Dar, an old companion of the prophet, misrepresenting some
passages of the <i>Koran</i>, declared that the riches of this world were the source
of every crime, and that the wealthy should be compelled by force to give
their superfluities to the poor. Such doctrine was sure to obtain a favourable
hearing in a half-civilised country, where, from the unequal distribution
of plunder, a few had been suddenly enriched, but the great bulk of the
population reduced to comparative poverty. At the same time another sectary
announced that Mohammed was about to reappear, and execute justice
on the wicked and cruel men who tyrannised over the Mussulmans. The
people, expecting an approaching regeneration, despised their rulers, and
neglected the duties of social life. The second revision of the <i>Koran</i>, ordained
by Othman, was regarded by many of the Mussulmans as a corruption
of the true religion; they suspected that the caliph did not pay sufficient
deference to the authority of the prophet; especially as in certain prayers
he made four prostrations where Mohammed only used two; and he had
rebuilt a chapel destroyed by Mohammed’s special command.</p>

<p>We have been so long accustomed to see the Mohammedan religion
united with despotic government, that we are naturally surprised to find a
pure democracy under the caliphate; from the very beginning, every affair
of importance was submitted to the general assembly; and all, except slaves,
were permitted to state their opinions freely. No practical inconvenience
arose from this custom, whilst disorder was checked by the sacred character of
the prophet, the dignified demeanour of Abu Bekr, or the stern severity
of Omar. But Othman possessed no such influence; when he attempted to
stem the popular tide, he was attacked in his very pulpit, and driven by
volleys of stones from the assembly. Satires and lampoons, “those straws,”
which, as Lord Bacon says, “show the direction of the wind,” appeared
in countless abundance.</p>

<p>Parties and factions were formed on every side; each province demanded
a new governor, every faction desired a new caliph. The leaders in these
disturbances were the ancient companions of the prophet; and many of the
most devoted Mussulmans were ready to join in a revolution. At length a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
part of the Egyptian army marched suddenly to Medina and demanded an
immediate reform of abuses. By a liberal use of promises and persuasions,
they were induced to retire; but it was only to return the following year,
irritated by disappointment, and strengthened by large bodies of partisans
from Cufa and Bassora. Othman once more soothed the mutineers, but as
they were returning home, they learned that the caliph’s secretary had sent
official orders that they should be massacred. It is not quite certain that the
caliph had sanctioned this perfidy, but that it was meditated does not admit
of doubt. The soldiers, justly enraged, again appeared before Medina,
demanding the head of the secretary; when that was refused, they slew
Othman himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[656 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The fatal day on which this atrocity occurred was Friday, which the
Mohammedans keep holy. It was Othman’s custom on this day to fast until
he had read through the entire <i>Koran</i>, and he was engaged in the perusal of
the sacred volume, when the approach of the assassins was announced.
Some of the caliph’s friends advised him to make some preparations for
resistance, but he replied that he had seen Mohammed in a dream, and
had been informed that they should break their fast together that day in
paradise.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the conspirators advanced sword in hand. Five hundred
guards attempted to check their progress, but were cut to pieces; the
caliph’s wife threw herself in their path and had her hand cut off; the sons
of Ali, and some of the old companions of the prophet, endeavoured to propitiate
the mutineers, but were forced to consult their own safety by flight.
Othman tranquilly read the <i>Koran</i> in the midst of the confusion; he
scarcely deigned to raise his head when the enraged soldiers burst into
his apartment. At their head was a son of Abu Bekr, named Muhammed,
who seized Othman by the beard, and prepared to strike a fatal blow. The
caliph, looking him steadily in the face, asked, “O Muhammed! what think
you that your sainted father would say, if he saw my beard in your grasp?”
Struck with the words, Muhammed drew back in silence; but his companions,
less scrupulous, rushed upon Othman, and he fell covered with wounds.
His blood gushed upon the <i>Koran</i> which he held in his hand; it is said to
be still preserved as a relic in the mosque of Damascus. So great was the
terror diffused by this event, that no one dared to perform the funeral obsequies;
the body remained three days unburied; at length Ali gave orders
for its sepulture, but it was buried by night, and in a private cemetery.</p>

<p>The orthodox Mussulmans reverence Othman in the present day for the
action which excited most resentment in his own, namely, the revision of the
<i>Koran</i>. They cite respecting him, the following traditionary saying of
the prophet, “I have seen the name of Othman written on the gate of paradise;
I have seen it marked behind the throne of God, and on the wings of
the archangel Gabriel.” The Shiites regard him as a usurper, but they do
not execrate his memory so much as that of Omar.</p>

<p>At first the horror inspired by this murder was so great, that all parties
were reduced to silence. The surviving companions of Mohammed took
advantage of this interval of tranquillity, and nominated Ali fourth caliph.</p>

<p>Ali was the son of Abu Talib, that uncle of Mohammed who had so
faithfully watched over his childhood. He had been the first to acknowledge
the divine mission of his cousin, and he ever manifested the most
devoted attachment to his person. When Mohammed fled from Mecca,
Ali disguised himself in the prophet’s robes, and placed himself on his bed,
that the Meccans might not suspect his escape. When he followed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
patron to Medina, he married the prophet’s favourite daughter Fatima, by
whom he had several children. Mohammed on many occasions showed a
strong love for Ali; he appointed him his lieutenant in his first expedition
against the Greeks, at Tabuc, and during occasional absence, entrusted to
him the government of Medina. It is supposed, on very plausible grounds,
that Ali was actually nominated his successor by the prophet, but that
Aisha prevented the circumstance from being known. This injustice was
deeply felt by the son of Abu Talib and his partisans, but particularly by
Mohammed’s relations, who thought themselves neglected by the three first
caliphs. In vain, however, did his friends endeavour to persuade Ali to
attempt the forcible seizure of the reins of government; he replied constantly,
that he would never reign except by the free suffrages of the Mussulmans.
During the reign of Omar, his loyalty was so notorious, that he
was appointed governor of Arabia during the caliph’s absence at Jerusalem;
he refused to join those who conspired against Othman, and one of his
sons was severely wounded in defence of that sovereign. Finally, when
elected, he very reluctantly consented to accept the dignity of caliph, which
had twice already proved fatal to its possessors.</p>

<h4>ALI (656-661 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[656-657 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Ali commenced his reign by deposing all the governors of the provinces.
Amongst these were several men of great influence; especially Moawiyah
the son of that Abu Sufyan, who had been long the chief of the Meccan
idolaters, and the most bitter enemy of Mohammed. After Mecca had submitted,
Mohammed made Moawiyah one of his private secretaries; the
caliph Omar had raised him to the government of Syria, and he had now
ruled that important province during fifteen years. Crafty, subtle, intriguing,
possessing inflexible obstinacy, and boundless ambition, he received
Ali’s mandate for his deposition with violent indignation. As he was a near
relative of Othman, he resolved to declare himself his avenger, and though
that sovereign had left children, Moawiyah claimed to be his heir and
successor. He found allies in the centre of Arabia; and while the Syrians
were preparing to take arms, Aisha, with a numerous body of followers,
was already in the field. Though she had notoriously shared in the conspiracy
against Othman, she now proclaimed herself his avenger, and she
denounced Ali as the author of his death.</p>

<p>Joined with her were Talha and Zobair, two of Mohammed’s old companions,
who well knew the falsehood of Aisha’s allegations. They had
been the foremost to swear allegiance to Ali, but not having obtained all
that they desired, they ranged themselves in the ranks of the rebels, to
whom their presence gave additional confidence. The obligation of their
oaths they evaded by the expiatory offerings prescribed in the fifth chapter
of the <i>Koran</i>, which is one of the greatest blots on the character both of the
book and its author.</p>

<p>Aisha, contrary to the established custom of Arabia, led her forces in
person, mounted on a strong camel, and protected by an escort of picked
men. When she approached a small village named Jowab, all the dogs in
the place rushed out and barked at her with great fury. This she regarded
as an evil omen, and declared that Mohammed had told her, “One of my
wives, engaged in an evil design, shall be attacked by dogs in Jowab; take
care that you be not the wicked person.” Full of alarm, she wished to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
return; but Zobair and Talha, knowing how important was her presence,
suborned fifty false witnesses to swear that the village was never known by
the name of Jowab. As she still seemed anxious to depart, they spread
a report, that the army of Ali had gained a position in their rear, and consequently
that she could not return in safety. “This,” say the Moslem
historians, “was the first public lie told since the promulgation of Islam.”</p>

<p>The two armies met at Khoraiba, a place in the neighbourhood of Bassora;
Ali’s forces amounted to twenty thousand men, all picked soldiers,
those of Aisha were more numerous, but they were, for the most part, raw
and undisciplined levies. After a brief contest, the rebels were routed;
Talha fell wounded mortally from his horse, and with his dying breath
besought pardon from God for his share in the murder of Othman and his
treachery to Ali. When told of this, the generous conqueror exclaimed
that God had granted Talha time for repentance before receiving his soul
into heaven. Zobair escaped from the battle, but was overtaken on the
road to Mecca by his pursuers, who cut off his head, and brought it as an
acceptable present to the caliph. Ali expressed so much indignation at
the sight, that the bearers assailed him with bitter reproaches, saying, “You
are the evil genius of the Mussulmans; you consign to hell those who
deliver you from your enemies, and you name those who attack your men
companions of Satan.” The victory, however, could not be regarded as
complete until Aisha had been forced to submission; the strictest orders
were given to respect her person, but also it was desired that no pains
should be spared to make her prisoner. Seventy men had their hands cut
off attempting to seize her camel by the bridle; the pavilion in which she
sat, was stuck so full of arrows that it resembled a porcupine; at length a
soldier cut the back sinew of the camel, the animal fell helpless on his
knees, and Aisha remained a captive. Muhammed, the son of Abu Bekr,
was sent to take charge of her; she loaded him with the fiercest invectives,
but he did not make any reply. When she was brought before Ali, he
received her in the most courteous manner, recommended her to forbear
from meddling with public affairs for the future, and sent her under a faithful
escort to Medina. Thus ended the first great battle between the opponents
and the partisans of Ali; it is frequently called by eastern writers
“the battle of the camel” from the animal on which Aisha rode; it was
the prelude to many and fearful scenes of slaughter.</p>

<p>The rebellion in Syria next engaged the attention of Ali; Moawiyah
had not only rejected his offers of accommodation, but denied his title to
the caliphate: in order to justify this rebellion, and strike the eyes of the
multitude, Moawiyah procured the bloody robe in which Othman was murdered,
and caused it to be borne in solemn procession through the streets of
Damascus. This sight so powerfully inflamed the popular passions, that
though it was then the middle of summer, more than thirty thousand persons
bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to taste fresh water, until they
had avenged the death of Othman. Among the leading partisans of the
Syrian governor was Amru, the conqueror of Egypt, who seemed to share
the general excitement, though well aware that Ali was innocent of the
imputed crimes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[657-658 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The hostile forces met in the plains of Siffin, on the western bank of
the Euphrates, not far from the city of Racca. Neither leader was prepared
for general action, and ninety days were wasted in desultory skirmishes
between divisions. His impetuous valour gave Ali the victory in most of
these encounters; he challenged his rival to decide the dispute by single<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
combat; but Moawiyah would not venture to enter the lists. The last
action at Siffin continued all night, to the great disadvantage of the
Syrians; they would have been driven from their very entrenchments, had
not the crafty Moawiyah made an appeal to the superstitious feelings of Ali’s
followers. He ordered some of his men to place copies of the <i>Koran</i> on the
points of their lances, and advancing to the front of the lines, exclaim,
“This is the book that ought to decide all differences between us; this is
the word of God, and the code of our faith; it expressly forbids the shedding
of Moslem blood.” Coarse as was the artifice, it had the most complete
success; the troops of Irak, the flower of the caliph’s forces, threw down
their arms, and clamorously demanded that a negotiation should be commenced.
In vain did Ali command them to continue the fight, assuring
them that Moawiyah disregarded the <i>Koran</i>, and was equally the enemy of
God and man; the soldiers clamorously replied that they would not fight
against the book of God, and threatened the caliph with the well-known fate
of Othman.</p>

<p>From the moment that he was checked in the midst of victory, Ali seems
to have despaired of the issue of the contest; when required to name an
arbitrator, he coldly answered, “He that is not at liberty, cannot give his
advice; you must now conduct the affair as you think proper.” His soldiers
took him at his word, and nominated on the part of the caliph, Abu Musa,
whose chief merit was, that he had written a faulty copy of the <i>Koran</i>,
and whose fidelity had been long more than suspected. Moawiyah appointed
a much more subtle negotiator, Amru, universally regarded as the most
able statesman of the period. The arbitrators were enjoined to decide the
dispute according to the <i>Koran</i> and the traditions of the prophet, and to
pronounce judgment in the next month of Ramadhan.</p>

<p>Amru persuaded Abu Musa, that the best plan that could be adopted, was
to declare the throne vacant, and proceed to a new election. When the day
for giving judgment arrived, Abu Musa, as had been agreed, first ascended
the pulpit, and with a loud voice pronounced the following words; “I depose
both Ali and Moawiyah from the caliphate, in the same manner that
I draw this ring from my finger.” Amru next ascended, and said, “You
have heard Abu Musa pronounce the deposition of Ali: I confirm it; and I
invest Moawiyah with the supreme authority in the same manner that I now
draw this ring upon my finger. I hail him as the legal successor of Othman,
the avenger of his blood, and the most worthy of the Moslems to command
the faithful.”</p>

<p>This unexpected declaration created a violent tumult. Abu Musa accused
Amru of breach of faith, called him a wretch, a dog, an unclean beast, and
imprecated on his grave all nameless desecrations; Amru replied, that his co-arbitrator
was a learned blockhead, a jackass loaded with books, and the grandfather
of stupidity; at the same time, he stoutly maintained his sentence.</p>

<p>This event was fatal to the cause of Ali; his soldiers, who had forced
him to commence the imprudent negotiation, felt that their fidelity must for
the future be suspected, and began to desert in whole battalions. The new
and formidable sect of the Kharijites, that is, “the deserters,” appeared in
the midst of Arabia, declaring that both the rivals had forfeited their right
to reign, by submitting to human judgment what God alone should determine.
It was necessary to march a large army against these fanatics, and
the time which Ali wasted in their subjugation, was employed by Moawiyah
in new conquests. It would be difficult to form an idea of the vindictive
rage which filled all parties at this period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>We have already mentioned the view taken of affairs, by the fanatical
Kharijites. Three of this sect happened to meet at Mecca, and after some
discourse agreed that if the three chief causes of discontent were removed,
namely, Ali, Moawiyah, and Amru, the affairs of the Mussulmans would
soon be restored to their ancient flourishing condition. Finally, they resolved
to devote themselves for the common advantage, and agreed, that
on a stated day, one should slay Ali at Cufa; another, Moawiyah at Damascus;
and the third, Amru in Egypt. The attempt was made; Amru on
that day did not appear in public; Moawiyah escaped with a few slight
wounds; Ali alone received a mortal stroke.</p>

<p>The respect which the Shiites have for the memory of Ali, borders on
idolatry. All the Mussulmans, however, now join in commiserating his
calamities, and blaming the violence of which he was the victim. Every
time that they pronounce his name, they accompany it with the benediction,
“May God render his face glorious.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">[659-661 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the contest between Ali and Moawiyah, the first of the Omayyad
caliphs, arose the distinction of the Mohammedans into Sunnites and
Shiites. The chief points at issue between them, are the following;
(1) The Shiites, or as they call themselves, the Adalians, or “lovers of
justice,” assert that the three first caliphs were usurpers; the Sunnites
declare that they were legitimate monarchs, elected according to the sunna,
or traditional law of the prophet. (2) The Shiites regard Ali as the equal
of Mohammed; some even assert his superiority, but the Sunnites deny that
he possessed any special dignity. (3) The Shiites assert that the <i>Koran</i> is
made void by the authority attributed to tradition; the Sunnites say that
tradition is necessary to complete and explain the doctrines of the <i>Koran</i>.</p>

<p>The Turks, Egyptians, and Arabs belong to the Sunnite sect; the tenets
of the Shiites are professed by the Persians, a great portion of the Tatars,
and several of the Mohammedan princes in India.</p>

<p>Ali was buried at Cufa, but the exact place of his sepulchre cannot be
determined. A magnificent mosque has been erected in the neighbourhood
of the city, which is called Meshed-Ali, the place of Ali’s martyrdom; it is,
to this day, a favourite object of pilgrimage to devout Mussulmans.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5f2"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5f">f</a></span></p>

<p>So, after a most turbulent and unhappy caliphate, Ali died of his wound,
in the sixty-third year of his age, and the fifth of his reign, 661 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, and
the thirty-eighth year of the Hegira; making the third caliph slain within
twenty years by the hand of an assassin.</p>

<p>Ali was an upright and honourable man, a patron of literature and the
fine arts, and himself a poet. He certainly merited better treatment at the
hands of his own subjects, having been a just judge, and a kind and paternal
governor; oftener forgiving than punishing the misdeeds of those who were
so frequently conspiring against his life and interests. His lineal descendants
are sheriffs and emirs; permitted to wear their turbans and hair in a
peculiar fashion, differing from the usages of all other Moslems.</p>

<p>Ali left two sons, Hassan and Hosein. Hassan was in his thirty-fifth
year when he succeeded his father, as the fifth caliph of the Moslems. The
people chose Hassan without opposition, owing to his having been a favourite
of his grandfather, the prophet; whom also he is said to have resembled in
features. Moreover, he was a benevolent, upright, and devout man; but he
grievously lacked the energy so indispensable for a ruler in troubled times.
The new caliph would willingly have disbanded the army ready to march
upon Syria; for he was no lover of warfare, and would rather have forfeited
the Syrian provinces than mixed in battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>His brother Hosein, however, was a warrior; and so were many of the
veteran generals who had sworn allegiance to his father, and whose plans he
was therefore compelled to follow up. He accordingly marched upon Syria;
sending forward twelve thousand light troops, under Kais, to check the
progress of Moawiyah, who was advancing to meet Hassan’s army. Kais
succeeded in repelling the Syrians; and secured a position, where he might
await the arrival of the main body of the army, which, however, never
reached its destination. The troops of Hassan were chiefly from Irak, and
not inclined to enter upon the campaign; moreover, they knew him to be an
inefficient commander. A revolt broke out amongst the soldiery, in which
Hassan was wounded. This occurred at Madain, and the caliph was compelled
to seek refuge with the governor in the citadel. He ultimately sent
proposals to Moawiyah, offering to abdicate in his favour, under certain stipulations,
to which Moawiyah readily agreed. So, to the great indignation of
Hosein, Hassan abdicated; and eventually the two brothers settled in
Medina, where Moawiyah supplied them liberally with funds.</p>

<p>This act doubtless saved a good deal of bloodshed; and, in the thirty-ninth
year of the Hegira, the sixth caliph, Moawiyah I, began to reign. His
first act was to almost exterminate the sect of Seceders; a people even more
dangerous than the modern Janissaries, and against whom the caliph
Moawiyah had deep hatred, owing to the stab he had received in Damascus.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_5t"><a href="#parthians_endnote_5t">t</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI. THE OMAYYADS</h3>

<h4>FOUNDATION OF THE OMAYYADS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[661-750 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>With Moawiyah commenced the dynasty of the house of Omayyah,
called the “Omayyads.” This caliph is said to have patronised literature;
and during his reign many of the Greek sciences were first introduced into
Arabia. Moawiyah succeeded in re-establishing peace in his dominions.
One of his earliest appointments was the reinstatement of Amru in the government
of Egypt; allotting him, in grateful recognition of his services, the
whole revenue of that wealthy country for his life-time; but Amru was
advanced in years, and only enjoyed his preferment for a short time, dying
in 663.</p>

<p>Moawiyah now turned his thoughts to foreign conquest; hoping to leave
an illustrious name, together with the royal succession, to his son Yazid.
Accordingly he sent him, at the head of a powerful force, to subdue that
famous capital, which was destined in later years to become, as it now
remains, the headquarters of Islamism and the seat of the Moslem rulers.</p>

<p>Great preparations were afoot, and the troops were despatched both by
land and sea to attack Constantinople. The Greek power was on the decline;
their emperor, a grandson of Heraclius, indolent and unfitted for his
high office; and the Moslems entertained sanguine hopes of success. Their
fleet passed the Dardanelles, and the army landed within seven miles of
Constantinople. The besieged had fortified the place, and repulsed the
assault with the Greek fire&mdash;a new and terrible agent of destruction to the
Moslems, who, after ravaging the neighbouring coasts, wintered about eight
miles from Constantinople, at the island of Cyzicus. Through six long
years they strove, but in vain; countless lives were lost, ships wrecked, and
vast sums of money expended. Long practice and the necessary energy,
revived in the Greeks a few sparks of that military ardour which had for
years been slumbering. They even sallied forth and attacked the Moslems;
punishing them so severely, that Moawiyah, now an old man, was glad to
obtain a truce for thirty years, paying the emperor annually three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
pieces of gold, fifty slaves, and fifty Arabian horses. Yazid is accused of
having instigated the murder of the mild and virtuous Hassan, who had
abdicated in his father’s favour, but who had stipulated to resume the
caliphate after Moawiyah’s death. This act, which secured his own succession,
was perpetrated in the year forty-seven of the Hegira, 669 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[669-680 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Moawiyah sent Achbar ben Nafi al-Fahri, a competent general, to follow
up the conquests so triumphantly commenced in Africa by Abdallah ben
Saad. This man proceeded from Damascus with ten thousand horse, making
good speed towards Africa; and, his force rapidly augmenting by the
accession of barbarian troops, he retook the city of Cyrene; but during the
siege many of its magnificent edifices were destroyed. Continuing westward,
he traversed desolate wilds and jungles, and passed through places
infested with lions, tigers, and serpents, until he beheld the domains of
ancient Carthage, the present Tunisian provinces. Here he founded a
stronghold&mdash;a kind of vast caravansary, where stores might be accumulated,
and whose thick and lofty walls might prove a safeguard in case of defeat.
This place eventually gave origin to the city called Carwahn, or Kairwan&mdash;literally
signifying a lodgment for travellers and beasts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Aisha, who had caused so much discord and bloodshed,
had, in the fifty-sixth year of the Hegira, numbered her years upon earth.
One of her last acts of vengeance was the refusing sepulture to the body
of Hassan, who had expressed a wish in his testament to be buried by the
side of his grandsire, Mohammed, insisting that the mansion was hers, and
carrying her malice even beyond the grave, so that Hassan was interred in
the ordinary burial-ground.</p>

<p>The sand of Moawiyah’s life was now rapidly running out. He was
anxious, ere death, to render the caliphate hereditary, and to perpetuate it
in his line. Accordingly he publicly named his son Yazid as his successor,
and commanded the provinces to send deputies to do fealty to him. This
was more than Mohammed himself or any of his successors had ventured
to require. The delegates arrived from all parts to Damascus, and gave
their hands to Yazid, in pledge of fealty; thus establishing the dynasty of
Omayyah, which extended over nearly a hundred years. Fourteen of them
were designated the Pharaohs of that line. With Moawiyah were introduced
the luxury and splendour, so linked with all our notions of oriental
pomp and proverbially designated the insignia of a caliphate, which had
succeeded to the stern and frugal simplicity of the early Islams. The waters
and the gardens of Damascus were irresistible persuasions to indolence&mdash;that
peculiar luxury, known among the Orientals by the term <i>kaif</i>, and in
the West by the expressive Italian phrase, <i>dolce far niente</i>. The seat of the
caliphate was fixed at Damascus; for neither Medina nor Cufa was now considered
a fit residence for the Moslem caliphs. Moawiyah, having provided
for his son, gave up the ghost in 680 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span></p>

<h4>YAZID MADE CALIPH</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[680-683 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Yazid, then in his thirty-fourth year, was proclaimed caliph&mdash;a man
who is said to have been gifted with talents, but addicted to every debasing
vice, delighting in splendid attire, passionately fond of music and poetry,
and much given to indulge in the indolent <i>kaif</i>; all these the result of
long residence in the delightful but enervating climate of Damascus. But
whilst the seventh caliph was idly spending his hours and days, the brave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
general Achbar had returned to his command in Africa, to pursue his career
of conquest. He traversed Numidia (Algiers), the extensive countries of
Morocco, and the ancient Mauretania, subduing and converting the inhabitants,
till, arriving at the western shores of Africa, the waters of the Atlantic
opposed his farther progress. Here, spurring his steed up to the saddle-girths
in the surge, he is said to have elevated his scimitar towards heaven,
exclaiming, “Did not these waters present an insuperable barrier, I would
carry the faith and the law of the faithful to countries reaching from the
rising of the sun to the setting thereof.”</p>

<p>But soon after this tidings reached Achbar that a rebellion had broken
out in his rear. He had overdone his task, and had now to pay dearly for
the temerity which the sagacious Omar had so often and so carefully repressed
amongst his generals. As he marched through Numidia, he was
much harassed by a band of mountaineers, who would never let themselves
be entangled in a pitched battle; but descending from their fastnesses, cut
off the stragglers, and carried havoc into the broken ranks. Achbar saw
that destruction was inevitable; and accordingly liberated his rival and
prisoner, Muhegir, telling him, that this was a day of martyrdom, and consequently,
liberty for them all; and that he would not therefore deprive
him of earning for himself the paradise of the faithful. The little Islam
band was literally cut to pieces; and the body of Achbar was found upon
a heap of slain, his broken scimitar still grasped by his lifeless hand.</p>

<p>During these events in Africa Yazid was endeavouring to secure undisputed
possession of the caliphate. The only two whom he feared as competitors
were Hosein and Abdallah, the sons of Ali and Zobair, who were
both residing at Medina. Yazid wrote from Damascus to the governor of
Medina, directing him to require from them the oath of fealty; but they,
learning that their lives would be in peril through the intrigues of the governor
and of Merwan ben Hakem, the villainous ex-secretary of Othman, fled
with their families to Mecca, where they openly opposed Yazid.</p>

<h4>SIEGE OF MECCA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[683-684 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Hosein was slain, and his family sent captives to Damascus, where they
were well treated by Yazid; who sent them under careful convoy to Medina.
The anniversary of the martyrdom of Hosein is kept with great solemnity in
Persia and Media; and in after years a splendid mausoleum was erected on
the spot where he fell, called by the Arabs the “Meshed Hosein” (the sepulchre
of Hosein). The death of Hosein furnished his friend and survivor,
Abdallah the son of Zobair, with a fresh claim to the caliphate, and a subject,
capable, in his able hands, of being well turned to account in working
upon the feelings and faith of the Islams. He was soon proclaimed caliph
by the house of Hashem, possessing at the same time a majority in his favour
at Mecca and Medina.</p>

<p>Open rebellion broke out, and Yazid with difficulty found one infirm old
general to espouse his cause. The veteran Muslim quitted Damascus with
twelve thousand horse and five thousand foot. Arriving at Medina, he found
the place securely entrenched and fortified. On the fourth day the city was
stormed, and compelled to surrender. Ali, the son of Hosein, and the partisans
and household of Omayyah, were despatched under careful escort to
Damascus, and then the place was given up to three days’ pillage. In the
sixtieth year of the Hegira, 683 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, Muslim, whose memory is execrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
by all devout Moslems, died on his march to Mecca; and the command was
assumed by Hosein ben Numair, a Syrian by birth. This general besieged
Mecca for forty days; and just as the inhabitants feared to share the same
fate as the people of Medina, news arrived that Yazid had expired at Hawwarin,
in the thirty-ninth year of his age, 684 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> This event changed the
fortunes of war. Numair offered allegiance to Abdallah; but this latter,
fearing treachery, simply permitted the Syrian general and his troops, without
arms, to march in procession round the ruins of the Kaaba, which had
been destroyed during the siege by fire. Part of the family of Omayyah,
then at Mecca, accompanied the Syrians on their return to Damascus.</p>

<p>All the sectarians of Ali hold the memory of Yazid in abhorrence, as the
instigator of the murder of the two brothers, Hassan and Hosein; and
charge him with sacrilege, in ordering the sack of Medina and Mecca.</p>

<p>Moawiyah II, son of Yazid, was proclaimed at Damascus eighth caliph of
the Moslem empire, being the third of the house of Omayyah, a man feeble
in mind and body, and one of the sect of Kadarii, maintaining the free will
of men against the dictates of wiser counsels and better conscience. This second
Moawiyah was in his twenty-first year when he reluctantly assumed the
caliphate; for his health was so bad, that he was compelled (most probably
from weak eyes) to shut himself up in darkened apartments, whence the
Arabs named him <i>Abu Laili</i>&mdash;the Father of Night. His chief counsellor
was one Omar Aheksus, who is said to have counselled him to abdicate,
after a short sway of six months’ duration; for which advice the Omayyads
buried the unfortunate man alive. This youthful caliph refused to nominate
a successor, declaring that his grandfather had been a usurper, his
father unworthy of so high a trust, and himself unwilling and unfit to
undertake it. Soon after his abdication he died, the wreck of a diseased
frame and morbid temperament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[684-689 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Again was Syria rent with civil discord. The people of Damascus favouring
the claims of Merwan, the secretary, as regent during the minority of
Khalid, Yazid’s son; whilst Egypt, Babylonia, Arabia, Khorasan, Medina,
and Mecca acknowledged Abdallah ben Zobair as caliph. Meanwhile,
Obaidah ben Zehad, the same that had caused Hosein to be slain, thought
the present an auspicious moment to secure for himself an independence.
After many fatigues he arrived at Damascus, in time to take an active part
in the election of Merwan as caliph, while Bassora declared its allegiance
to Abdallah. The claims of the former were admitted only in Syria, and
there were even there two factions. A conflict ensued between the two
factions; and the victory sided with Merwan, who was proclaimed caliph
and obliged to marry the mother of Khalid, Yazid’s wife.</p>

<p>Merwan speedily marched against Egypt, but twice returned; and again
twice faced about, tidings having reached him about the prowess of his
lieutenant, another Amru, who ultimately subjugated Egypt. The people
of Khorasan refused to acknowledge either caliph; they appointed Selim,
a younger brother of Obaid Allah, to act as regent, till affairs should be finally
settled. The fickle people of Cufa seemed to awaken from a prolonged
lethargy, and declared in favour of the descendants of Ali; only, however,
the next day to repudiate them. Four thousand men, under an aged general,
did absolutely start on a fanatical expedition to destroy both claimants
to the caliphate and their adherents; and so, rushing upon their fate, they
were all slain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fate of the heroic Achbar on the plains of Numidia was
known at Damascus and Medina. At this time reinforcements arrived from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
Egypt, which helped to revive the courage of the Moslems. This only endured
for a while; a large force from Constantinople, under experienced generals,
landed on the coast of Africa. The Egyptians deserted their standard,
Kairwan was vanquished, and the Moslems compelled to fall back upon Barca.
Abdul-Malik, the eldest son of Merwan, marched to the succour of the discomfited
Islam general; and the two forces combined marched upon Kairwan,
defeating the enemy in every action, and finally replanted the standard
of Islam in Kairwan. After this Abdul-Malik returned to Damascus, where
Merwan, having caused him to be proclaimed as his successor, died after a
reign of about eleven months, in the sixty-second year of the Hegira, 685 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span></p>

<h4>ABDUL-MALIK, CALIPH (685-705 A.D.)</h4>

<p>Abdul-Malik, the eleventh caliph, was proclaimed and acknowledged in
Syria, Egypt, and Africa. He was in the prime of life when he succeeded
to the musnud; full of enterprise, and distinguished as an able general and
an accomplished scholar; but so avaricious that he was surnamed by the
Arabs Kafhol Hagha, signifying in our vernacular, “skinflint.” Abdallah
ben Zobair was still acknowledged caliph of a great part of the Moslem
dominions; holding the seat of government at Mecca, which gave him great
influence over the troops of pilgrims, that even at that early period annually
resorted to the Kaaba. Abdul-Malik, jealous of this, established a rival
city of pilgrimage; fixing for this purpose on Al-Kudus (Jerusalem), sacred
in the eyes of Moslems, as the field connected with the acts and revelations
of Jesus Christ and of Moses (both of whom they acknowledge and reverence
as prophets), as well as the stage whereon Mohammed pretended to
have made his miraculous ascent to heaven; besides all this, the place was
surrounded by the tombs of the patriarchs. The temple at Jerusalem,
where Omar had prayed upon the steps, was converted into a mosque; and
it was enlarged so as to enclose these steps, and the stone called Jacob’s
stone on which the patriarch is said to have slumbered during his inspired
dream. This was kissed by Moslem pilgrims, as they had heretofore kissed
the Black Stone of the Kaaba. During the caliphate of Abdul-Malik there
was a fierce warrior, a son of Abu Obaidah, who was named Al-Mukhtar
(or the Avenger), because he undertook to avenge the death of Hosein.
With almost insuperable difficulties to contend against, he accomplished his
vow; being mortally wounded, and his small but sturdy band of seven hundred
followers cut down to a man. His death enabled Musa ben Zobair,
a brother of the caliph Abdallah, to govern Babylonia and Cufa. He was at
this period a comely man in the thirty-sixth year of his life, and in all
points well adapted to gain the esteem and love of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[689-692 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Abdul-Malik hearing of his success invaded Babylonia himself; heading
his army, and leaving his cousin Amru, who had been Merwan’s lieutenant
in Egypt, to govern Syria during his absence. The kinsmen deeply hated
each other; and the caliph had barely turned his back before Amru aspired
to the caliphate. Abdul-Malik hearing this, hastened back; and a deadly
conflict ensued between the two cousins and their adherents in the streets
of Damascus. The women are said to have rushed between the combatants,
holding up their children and imploring both sides to desist from so unnatural
a combat. Amru laid down his arms, and articles of reconciliation
were signed. The caliph broke his faith; and, getting his cousin into his
power, he struck off his head with his own scimitar; then, banishing his family,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
he put all who had sided with Amru to death. On the departure of the exiles
the caliph demanded the written contract of Amru’s widow, who replied
that she had folded it in his winding sheet, to be produced at the day of
judgment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p180.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Place of Worship, Mecca</span></p>
</div>

<p>Abdul-Malik now resumed his march to Babylonia, having sent trusty
messengers before him to tamper with the fealty of Abdallah’s subjects.
A battle took place near Tadmor (Palmyra), and the caliph possessed himself
of Babylonia and Persian Irak. Abdul-Malik appointed his brother
Besher ben Merwan governor of Babylonia; naming Musa ben Nosair,
who had long enjoyed his father’s confidence, as vizir to the youthful
governor. This man we shall find hereafter figuring as a noted character in
the pages of Islam conquest. The caliph intrusted Musa with the military
rolls of the province, holding him responsible; and the young governor confided
to him the seal of office, intrusting to him the entire direction of the
government. Having made all these arrangements, Abdul-Malik returned to
Damascus. He was now undisputed sovereign of all the eastern part of the
Moslem dominions, and further secured peace in other quarters by a shameful
augmentation of tribute to the Christian emperor; but he did all this to
enable him the better to carry out his scheme of attacking Abdallah, and
bearding him in his very den at Mecca.</p>

<h4>SIEGE OF MECCA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[692-698 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Hajjaj ben Yusuf, appointed to command the expedition to Mecca, was
joined by five thousand troops under Tarik ben Amru. The former general
is celebrated in Moslem history as the ablest and most eloquent man of his
day. Free pardon and protection were proclaimed to all who would join the
standard of these generals. Abdallah sent troops to check their progress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
but his precaution was unavailing. Hajjaj arrived at the city gates. Before
commencing the assault, arrows, whereto proclamations and letters for the
inhabitants were attached, were discharged over the walls, warning the inhabitants
to desert Abdallah, who was so obstinate as to resist to the last,
though their sacred city should crumble into ruins. The city was assailed
with battering-rams, whilst flaming balls of pitch and naphtha were thrown
over the walls and set fire to the houses.</p>

<p>Abdallah, though old and infirm, held out bravely against the besiegers.
It is said that his mother displayed wonderful energy and courage during
the siege, she being a granddaughter of Abu Bekr; ten thousand are said
to have deserted to the camp of Hajjaj, and many supporters of Abdallah
were slain. In this forlorn plight he was offered his own conditions of surrender;
but, consulting his mother as usual, she reminded him that his
father Zobair had died for the same cause, and advised him not to bend to the
yoke of the line of Omayyah; saying that it were better to die honourably
than live dishonoured for the few years that yet remained for him. Finally,
after prodigies of valour, the poor old man was struck down by a brick,
which hastened his death; and he sank exhausted, fighting to the last, dying,
after a disastrous nine years’ reign, in the seventy-second year of his age and
the seventieth year of the Hegira; so that in those climates, where girls are
frequently mothers at fourteen and fifteen, the aged mother of Abdallah, who
aided in the fight to the last, must have passed her eighty-sixth year. She
died in a few hours after hearing of her son’s gallant conduct and death.
Thus ended the rival caliphate.</p>

<p>The oath of fealty was administered to all the Arabs of those districts.
Hajjaj remained governor of Mecca and Medina, as notorious for his cruelty
as he was renowned for his valour.</p>

<p>In the year seventy-three of the Hegira peace was again restored throughout
the Moslem dominions, which were now united, under the caliphdom of
Abdul-Malik; and this caliph, being freed from the bonds of civil discord,
now turned his thoughts to foreign conquest, hoping to revive in his name
the early triumphs of Islam. First, he threw off the tribute to the Greek
emperor, which, originating in the reign of Moawiyah I at 3000 dinars of gold
annually, had now augmented to the yearly sum of 365,000. The Christian emperor
Leontius had made himself unpopular; and the caliph, availing himself of
the troubled state of his affairs, sent Ibn Walid on a depredatory expedition.
Ibn Walid returned with much booty; and Lazuca and Baruncium were taken
by the Moslems, through the treachery of Sergius, one of the Greek emperor’s
generals. During the civil wars in the Moslem empire the Christians had
retaken most of their African possessions, slaying Zohair, the commander of
Barca; so that it was only in the interior that the Moslems yet held any
strong positions. The caliph determined to recover all these. In the seventy-fourth
year of the Hegira, Hassan ben Nohman was sent, with forty thousand
picked men, to subjugate the northern coasts of Africa; and proceeded to
Carthage, of which he after a time made himself master. Most of the
inhabitants fell by the sword, but some escaped by sea to Sicily and Spain.
The walls were demolished, the city given up to plunder, and several beautiful
females were taken captives. But while rejoicing over their late
victories, a fleet suddenly appeared in the offing, bringing troops from Constantinople
and Sicily, reinforced by Goths from Spain; the expedition being
under the command of the prefect John, an experienced and valiant soldier.</p>

<p>The Arab commander, finding himself unable to contend against overwhelming
numbers, retired to Kairwan, where the Islams fortified themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
patiently awaiting the reinforcements, which in due time arrived.
With their combined forces the Moslems routed John and his adherents,
besieged Carthage, and razed that noble city to the ground, giving the place
up to flames. The imperial troops were rapidly expelled from the coast of
Africa. But the Moslems had a formidable enemy to contend with in
Kahina the sorceress, the mother of that Ibn Kahina who had so harassed
the troops of the noble and gallant Achbar. Under this pseudo-prophetess
and queen the Moors and Berbers made a valiant stand, and after several
engagements Hassan was compelled to fall back upon the frontiers of Egypt.
On this, Kahina is said to have addressed her troops, suggesting that they
should lay waste the cities and countries intervening between her own possessions
and the land of Egypt, saying that the wealth and the fruitfulness
of these parts were the inducements which led these Islams continually to
disturb their quiet and predicting that they would be sure, so long as these
existed, to return again in greater numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[698-699 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Her suggestion was immediately acted upon. Cities and towns were
razed to the ground; fruit trees cut down; fields desolated with fire;
and the whole aspect of the country, from Tangiers to Tripoli, converted,
from being one extensive garden, into a hideous waste, with not a tree standing
to shelter a wayfarer from the sun. But the inhabitants of the plains,
who were great sufferers by this extreme measure, hailed the return of the
Moslems. Kahina was again in the field. This time her ranks were thinned
by desertion, and she was taken prisoner and beheaded. Hassan returned,
laden with booty, to Damascus, where he was received with honour, and
made governor of Barca, still retaining the military command of the provinces
in Africa. Hassan, however, fell a victim to his honours; for the
caliph’s brother, then viceroy of Egypt, offended that his own lieutenant
should be superseded in Barca, waylaid Hassan and deprived him of his
appointment, keeping him so closely guarded that he died of a broken heart.
Abdul-Aziz ben Merwan, the caliph’s brother, named Musa ben Nosair to
the command in northern Africa. Musa was sixty years old, but still hale
and vigorous. He was accompanied by his three sons.</p>

<p>Musa joined the army in Africa, and told the soldiers that he was one of
themselves; if they found him act well, to thank God and endeavour to
imitate him; if wrong, to reprove, and show him his error; and if any
among them had to complain, let them speak out like men. “Finally,” said
he, “I have instructions from the caliph to pay you three times the amount
of arrears due”: and if anything made the cheers of the soldiers more
hearty, it was this winding up to his speech. A sparrow is said to have
fluttered into his bosom whilst he was speaking, which Musa interpreted into
a favourable omen, crying “Victory, by the master of the Kaaba; the victory
is ours;” at the same time scattering the feathers of the poor bird into
the air.</p>

<p>Musa was liberal, and quite divested of pride&mdash;points that endeared him
to the Moslem soldiers. On first arriving he had to contend with a Berber
chief, Warkastaf, who headed a mountain horde that committed depredations
between Zaghwar and Kairwan; him he eventually killed, and his sons,
Abdul-Aziz and Merwan, scattered the mountaineers and made them retreat
beyond the borders of the southern desert. Musa sent his patron a large
share of the spoils which had been taken in Africa; and these chanced to
arrive in Egypt at the very moment that Abdul-Aziz, the viceroy, was at his
wits’ end how to appease the wrath of his brother the caliph. The caliph,
who was an avaricious man, immediately decided in Musa’s favour; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
confirmed his brother’s appointment; making Musa emir of Africa. It was in
the seventy-fifth year of the Hegira that Musa was confirmed in his post; and
in the eightieth he fought the severest contest of his African campaign,
defeating strong hordes of the barbarians in their own fastnesses amongst the
defiles of Mount Atlas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[699-705 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At last the two armies came to a pitched battle, when a Berber chief challenged
any Moslem champion to single combat. There being some delay
in answering this challenge, Merwan, the son of Musa, was deputed to undertake
the conflict; when, though very inferior in size and strength, he slew
both horse and rider, thrusting his javelin through them both. Kasleyah
the king of the Berbers was slain, and the victory completed; and Merwan
espoused the daughter of the deceased king, having by her two sons.</p>

<p>But Musa, not satisfied with triumphs by land, longed to launch out upon
the seas. The caliph had ordered his predecessors to erect an arsenal at
Tunis; and Musa undertook to carry out this project, building dockyards and
a fleet to carry out his proposed enterprise. Many people opposed this scheme,
even as their descendants the modern Arabs set their face against any improvements,
as innovations which were not practised by their ancestors before
them. One old Berber advised him to persevere; and he followed the
advice to such purpose that, by the end of the year eighty-one of the Hegira,
701 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, the arsenal and dockyard were completed, and a strong fleet rode
at anchor in the port of Tunis. About this time, a fleet sent by Abdul-Aziz
took the island of Lampedusa, capturing immense booty; with which his ships
were returning heavily laden, when a mighty tempest arose; the fleet was
driven upon the rocky coast of Africa, and nearly all hands perished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[705-715 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Early in the eighty-second year of the Hegira, Musa embarked with
a thousand volunteers, chosen from the bravest amongst his followers, upon
his first naval expedition; but when the fleet was ready to set sail, much to
the disappointment of those whom he had enlisted, he disembarked and
handed over the command to his third and yet untried son, Abdallah. He
returned laden with spoil; so much so that each of his followers laid claim
to one thousand dinars of gold as his share in the booty. This expedition
was the terrible Algerine scourge in embryo, which in after years carried
death and devastation wherever the black flag waved triumphant. These
vessels returned to port about the same time when tidings reached Musa of
the death of the caliph Abdul-Malik, which occurred in the eighty-sixth year
of the Hegira, 705 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, in the sixtieth year of his age and twentieth of his
reign. His son Walid was immediately proclaimed twelfth caliph or successor
of the prophet at Damascus; and Musa, immediately transmitting the
caliph’s due of the immense booty brought home by the late marine expedition
from Tunis, at once obtained his own confirmation in his post as governor
or emir of northern Africa, while the interests of his sons were proportionately
advanced.</p>

<p>Walid was an idle and voluptuous man; he intrusted the government of
his vast dominions entirely to the emirs appointed by his father, while he
himself, hating to be troubled with the affairs of state, lived almost secluded
from the world within the precincts of his extensive harem, where he had no
less than sixty-three wives and yet died without leaving any issue. His
reign is only distinguishable for the vast improvements he introduced in
the architectural style of the East. His enervated life secluded him from the
well-won and well-worn laurels which had secured for his ancestors a home
and a name. One of his fourteen brothers, Maslama, invaded Asia Minor,
marching on Cappadocia, and besieging the city of Tyana strongly garrisoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
by Christians. Finally, Tyana was won; and while Maslama extended his
conquests, his son was spreading the faith of Islam in the East.</p>

<p>In the early part of Walid’s caliphate the fleets of Musa continued to be
the scourge of the western parts of the Mediterranean. Some vessels proceeded
to Sicily, some to Sardinia; Syracuse was plundered; and hundreds
of beautiful women were borne away by these corsairs and sold to adorn the
harems of the wealthier Moslems. Abdallah also made a successful descent
upon Majorca, whilst Musa and his eldest sons triumphed over Fez, Daguella,
Morocco, and Sus; the valiant tribes of the Zeuetes capitulated, till
finally the caliph Walid was acknowledged throughout Almagreb to Cape
Nov on the Atlantic; and there remained only Tingitania, the northern
extremity of Almagreb, to be subdued.</p>

<p>While the two vast continents of Europe and Africa were divided by the
Straits of Hercules, Ceuta and Tangiers were the rocky defences of this narrow
passage on the African side; there remained but the opposite stronghold
of Gibraltar to secure the key to the Mediterranean; and beyond this, in the
haze of distance, Musa shaded his eyes to gaze upon the purple mountains of
the fair Andalusia; perhaps the night breeze wafted across that narrow channel
the strange fragrance of a thousand orange groves, intermixed with the
wild herbs and flowers of the mountains of Spain, and woke the weary Arab
from his dream of the dreary reality of his hot African clime to the desired
conquest of that unknown country. Brightly were such dreams realised in the
siege and subsequent capture of Ceuta, and in the ultimate conquest of Spain.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_6b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_6b">b</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the story of the Arabian invasion of Europe to a later chapter,
we may continue with the destinies of the Omayyad dynasty.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h4>THE EASTERN CALIPHATE</h4>

<p>Immediately on his succession Walid had confirmed Hajjaj in the government
of Irak, and appointed as governor of Medina his cousin, Omar b. Abdul-Aziz,
who was received there with joy, his piety and gentle character being
well known. Under his government important works were undertaken at
Medina and Mecca by order of Walid, who, having no rivals to struggle
against, was able to give his attention to pacific occupations. The mosque
of Medina was enlarged, wells were sunk, the streets widened, and hospitals
established. At Mecca many improvements were introduced. The reputation
of Omar attracted to the two holy cities a great number of the inhabitants of
Irak, who were groaning under the iron hand of Hajjaj. The latter, who
was not a man to let his prey escape from his grasp, was so urgent with
Walid that he obtained the dismissal of Omar b. Abdul-Aziz in the year 93,
and the appointment of Othman b. Hayyan at Medina, and of Khalid b. Abdallah
at Mecca. These two prefects compelled the refugees at Mecca and
Medina to return to Irak, where many of them were cruelly treated and even
put to death by Hajjaj. It was probably his cruelty which drove so many
men of Irak to enlist in the armies of the East and the South; and this may
in some degree account for the unheard-of successes of Kotaiba b. Muslim in
Transoxiana, and of Muhammed b. Kasim in India. They may also be
explained by the ambition of Hajjaj, who, it is said, cherished the project of
creating a vast empire for himself to the east and south of the Moslem realm,
and had secretly promised the government of China to the first of his
generals who should reach that country. Be this as it may, in the course of
a very few years Kotaiba conquered the whole of Bokhara, Khwarizm, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
Transoxiana or Mawara-annahr, as far as the frontiers of China. Meanwhile
Muhammed b. Kasim invaded Mokram, Sind, and Multan, carried off
an immense booty, and reduced the women and children to slavery. In
Armenia and Asia Minor, Maslama, brother of the caliph Walid, and his
lieutenants, also obtained numerous successes against the Greeks. In
Armenia, Maslama even advanced as far as the Caucasus.</p>

<h4>SULEIMAN’S AMBITIONS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[715 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p185.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Costume of an Arabian Woman</span></p>
</div>

<p>Walid, in the very year of his death, which took place in 715, wished
to have his son Abdul-Aziz b. Walid chosen as his successor, and had offered
his brother Suleiman a great sum of money to induce him to surrender
his rights to the caliphate; but Suleiman obstinately refused to do so.
Walid went still farther, and sent letters to the governors of all the provinces,
calling on them to make the people take the oath of allegiance to his
son. None except Hajjaj and Kotaiba b. Muslim consented thus to set at
nought the order of succession established
by Abdul-Malik; and Suleiman succeeded
without difficulty at the death of his brother.
We can easily conceive the hatred felt by
Suleiman for Hajjaj, and for all that belonged
to him, far or near. Hajjaj himself
escaped by death; but Suleiman poured out
his wrath on his family, and strove to undo
all that he had done. First of all, Muhammed
b. Kasim, the conqueror of India, who
was cousin to Hajjaj, was dismissed from
his post and outlawed. Hajjaj had deprived
Yazid b. Muhallab of the government of
Khorasan; Suleiman conferred on him that
of Irak. Kotaiba b. Muslim, on learning
the accession of Suleiman, knew that his
own ruin was certain, and therefore anticipated
the caliph by a revolt. But Suleiman
induced Kotaiba’s troops to desert by
authorising them to return to their homes;
and when the illustrious general sought to
carry his army with him, a conspiracy was
formed against him which ended in his
murder. Yazid b. Muhallab, who preferred
Khorasan to Irak, obtained permission to
exchange. Immediately on his return to
Khorasan he set on foot a series of new
expeditions against Jorjan and Tabaristan.
But the inhabitants of Khorasan, which he
governed oppressively, made complaints
against him to the caliph, accusing him of practising extortions in order to
obtain such a sum of money as would enable him to rebel against his sovereign.
From that day Suleiman determined to get rid of Yazid. As, however,
he was then dreaming of the conquest of Constantinople, he thought it prudent
to dissemble his dissatisfaction for some time in order to concentrate his
attention on the object of his desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[715-724 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Byzantine Empire was disturbed by internal troubles during the years
715-717 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Suleiman resolved to take advantage of these in order to rid
himself forever of the hereditary enemy of Islam, and prepared a formidable
expedition. A fleet of eighteen hundred vessels, equipped at Alexandria,
sailed to the coasts of Asia Minor, took on board the Moslem army, commanded
by Maslama, and transported it to Europe. This army appeared
under the walls of Constantinople the 15th of August, 717, five months after
Leo III, the Isaurian, had ascended the throne. Once more the Greek fire
prevailed against the Moslems. Their fleet was destroyed by this terrible
engine of war; the army could obtain no fresh supply of provisions, and
suffered all the horrors of famine. Meanwhile the caliph, who desired to be
present in person at the taking of Constantinople, had set out to join the army.
He fell ill at Dabik, not far from Aleppo, and died there on the 22nd of
September in the same year, after having nominated as his own successor his
cousin, Omar b. Abdul-Aziz, and as successor to the latter, Yazid b. Abdul-Malik,
his own brother. In vain did the new caliph despatch from Egypt a
fleet of four hundred ships to carry arms and provisions to the army before
Constantinople; this fleet also was destroyed by the Greeks, and the Moslem
army was decimated by famine, and soon by the plague as well. A
hundred thousand men perished miserably under the walls of Constantinople,
and Maslama brought back to Asia Minor a mere handful of soldiers, and
that with great difficulty.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_6c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_6c">c</a></span></p>

<h4>THE LAST OMAYYADS (717-750 A.D.)</h4>

<p>The caliph appointed by Suleiman to be his successor was his cousin,
Omar II, the son of Abdul-Aziz, a sovereign in whom according to some
authors were united all the virtues of the great Omar without any of the
latter’s severity against unbelievers, while others accuse him of levying
intolerable imposts on the Christians. Yazid, Suleiman’s one time favourite,
the governor of Khorasan, was thrown into prison for defalcation, and
all other governors received strict orders not to resort to force and oppression
in spreading the doctrines of Islamism, but to proceed with all mildness and
humanity. Unfortunately for the realm the rule of the just and pious prince
whose soul turned from earthly greatness and pride of conquest to the joys
of paradise, was of but short duration. In the third year of his reign he
succumbed to a painful malady which caused grave suspicions of poisoning
to arise against certain of his ambitious kinsmen. Omar had not yet
attained his fortieth year when, deeply mourned by all his people, he was
laid in his grave at Deir Saman, in the neighbourhood of Hims (Emesa).</p>

<p>The four years’ reign of Yazid II, who had beforehand been appointed
Omar’s successor by his brother, Suleiman, ran its course in the midst of
civil and foreign strife. Scarcely had Yazid, Muhallab’s son, learned of the
death of the caliph when he escaped from prison and fleeing to Irak, where his
brothers and other kindred possessed a large following, raised the standard of
revolt. He was overcome, however, by the Syrian army under Maslama at
Akr, on the left bank of the Euphrates, and sought and found death on the
battle-field. His brothers were also overpowered by the hostile forces at
Kerman, their wives and children were sold as slaves and the rebellious
cities of Bassora and Wasit were heavily punished. At the same time wars,
desertions, and conspiracies were rife in the remaining provinces, especially
in northern Africa; while even in Spain and southern France the Moslem
arms no longer met with their former success. Meanwhile the caliph in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Damascus was giving himself up completely to the pleasures of love and song,
and in the arms of a favourite slave was seeking restoration from the
fatigues and hardships of a ruler’s life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[724-744 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Yazid’s brother and successor, Hisham, adopted an entirely different
course. Simple in taste, just and pious like both the Omars, he banished
from his court the luxury and extravagance in which most of his predecessors
had freely indulged. But the house of Omayyad had too many enemies
even among the believers themselves, and passions had been too deeply
stirred by the recent civil war to make it possible that the twenty years’
reign of a prince who in spite of many praiseworthy qualities had by his
avarice and suspicion incurred the enmity of all the city authorities, could
run its course without suffering violence from storms and accidents. The
abhorrence felt in Cufa toward the cruel and rapacious governor Khalid, had
moreover revived in the minds of the mercurial inhabitants of Irak, all
their former aversion to the Omayyads, and incited the Shiites to fresh
revolt. Khalid was indeed deposed from office and forced by torture to
disgorge his ill-got wealth, but the conspiracy was already too widespread
to be completely uprooted. Zaid, a grandson of Husein, headed a revolt in
the streets of Cufa, which resulted in a sharp struggle during which the
leader and most of his followers lost their lives. Zaid’s body was mutilated
and his head sent to the caliph at Damascus. But the new glory of martyrdom
served only to enhance the importance and sanctity of the Alids, and to
strengthen the hopes entertained by the Abbasids, their kinsmen, of entering
the succession and getting the sovereignty away from the Koreishites to
secure it to the house of Hisham to which alone, in the opinion of strict
believers, it rightfully belonged. They had a large following in Khorasan
and Transoxiana; and the Kharijites who, in consequence of the recent campaigns,
had spread over the entire realm, served them in India and in Africa
in the execution of their ambitious plans against the Omayyads.</p>

<p>The insurrections, conspiracies, and civil wars which under Hisham broke
out with ever increasing violence in the provinces, multiplying acts of
rapacity and revenge, and dealing death-blows to the welfare of country,
state, and people by the destruction of agriculture, industry, and trade, were
so many indubitable signs that the unity of the kingdom was about to be
dissolved, that the might of the Omayyad dynasty in Damascus was nearing
its end. The subjugated populations were beginning to recover from their
surprise and to bethink themselves of former times; and though the majority
still remained faithful to the new religion, the consciousness of their national
identity and remembrance of the past were not to be blotted from their
minds, and the bold leader who could best evoke these secret feelings could
count upon warm sympathy and a crowd of followers. The dissimilar
elements that religious zeal had served to bind together in the first enthusiasm
of the “Sacred War,” strove in the course of time, as other interests
came uppermost and smothered passions again broke loose, to separate
naturally and once more become distinct. These strivings on the part of
the people towards independence were effectually aided by the divisions and
hostilities that existed between the various commanders, by the machinations
of the Abbasids, and their co-religionists and by the avarice of the
caliph who, though observing the closest parsimony in his own mode of
living, loved to feast his eyes on full state coffers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[744-750 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Walid II, Hisham’s successor, scattered the hoarded treasures of his
predecessor, and delighted flatterers, courtiers, generals, and troops by
his boundless liberality. He disgraced himself, on the other hand, by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
licentiousness and excesses, and gave offence by running counter to all the
accepted Mohammedan customs and religious laws. However loudly smooth-tongued
poets, in whose company he squandered the wealth that was his by
oppression as well as by inheritance, might sing his praises, the people were
wroth with the unworthy ruler who spent his time in hunting and debauchery,
found all his pleasure in wine, song, and dance, indulged in unnatural
vices and flouted public decency by carrying with him dogs and wine on a
pilgrimage to Mecca. When, therefore, this godless caliph sent to the governors
a circular letter filled with pious maxims of the strictest orthodoxy,
calling upon all the people to acknowledge and swear allegiance to his two
minor sons, Hakam and Othman, as their future rulers, the unheard-of innovation
excited the liveliest dissatisfaction. Especially loud in their complaints
were the sovereign’s own kinsmen, who had each in secret cherished
the hope of succession; so that now another and more threatening danger
was added to those by which the royal house was already beset; disunion
within itself. The sons of Hisham and Walid I allied themselves with the
enemies of the Omayyads, and accused the caliph, whom they had also personally
affronted, of “unbelief, free-thought, and incest.” Even Khalid,
hitherto steadily devoted to the House of Omayyah, hesitated at swearing
allegiance to two children who “did not yet know how to pray, and could
not be accepted as lawful witnesses.” The caliph thereupon gave him into
the hands of his mortal enemy Yusuf, governor of Cufa, who caused his
members to be broken one after another until he died under the torture.
By this act Walid increased the number of his enemies. A widespread conspiracy
was formed in Damascus and its vicinity, under the leadership of
Yazid, son of the former caliph Walid I, as a result of which the commander
of the faithful was attacked by a troop of insurgents in his castle of Nadira,
and after a brave resistance was overpowered and killed. The following
day his head was carried on the end of a lance about the streets of Damascus,
and his own brother Suleiman refused to his remains the honour of
burial. The reign of Yazid III lasted but half a year. As a former rebel
against the rightful sovereign, as an adherent of the doctrines of free-will,
and as a parsimonious leader who curtailed the pay of his troops, he had
made many enemies; and would certainly have succumbed to the arms of
mighty Merwan, the Omayyad governor of Armenia and Aderbaijan, who
advanced upon him with a large army, had he not died just previous to the
encounter.</p>

<p>Merwan now entered Syria with his seasoned, experienced troops, captured
Himso, and in a desperate engagement that took place in a narrow
valley near Ain Diar defeated the Yemenite army that Hisham’s son, Suleiman,
had led into the field against him. In this battle Suleiman left seventeen
thousand men on the field of battle, and as many more fell into the
hands of Merwan, while the rest of his army scattered in disorder. When
the news of this battle reached Damascus, Ibrahim, whom Yazid III had
designated as his successor, fled with Suleiman from the capital, after having
put to death Walid’s sons and Yusuf, the earlier governor of Irak, who
were in prison, and seized the state treasures. Merwan, who had hitherto
acted only as Walid’s avenger and the protector of his sons, now found himself
in a position where he could stretch out his hand towards the crown of
caliph, and cause the oath of allegiance to be taken to himself. In order to
give his pretensions the appearance of legitimacy he made known the statement
of a fellow-prisoner of the murdered princes, who asserted that at his
death the eldest of them had made over his right of succession to the throne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
to him, Merwan. In spite of this sanction, whether true or false, and in
spite of the reconciliation which took place later with Ibrahim and Suleiman,
Merwan’s rule never met with full recognition. The battle of Ain Diar
had inflicted wounds too deep, had brought uppermost in too many minds
the sacred duty of revenge, to allow Merwan, the usurper, to ever come to
peaceful enjoyment of his power. The years of his reign were marked by
uninterrupted struggles with hostile factions, who had again united and all
over the realm were stirring up the people to revolt. Even the Syrians,
who had hitherto been the Omayyad’s strongest prop, went over in part to
the enemy, and Merwan, with all his military talent and the tireless activity
that had won for him the rather doubtful title of Himar (Donkey), could not
in the long run withstand such determined opposition. With insurrection,
tribal feuds, and civil strife in every province the whole realm was in a condition
of anarchy and lawlessness that destroyed all private peace, and
awoke in every breast an intense desire for a firm hand at the helm of state
that should guide it into less troubled waters. That such a ruler was no
longer to be looked for among the members of the house of Omayyah, divided
as it was, and having foot on no solid, religious ground, had lately become
the settled conviction in the minds of all.</p>

<p>In the East the active partisan, Abu Muslim, had raised the black flag of
the Abbasids and had appeared clad in black in company with his followers
at the most splendid feasts. “Under the embers,” said Nasr, governor of
Khorasan, to the caliph when he begged help against the house of Abbas
and its champion, Abu Muslim, “I see red coals that will soon burst into
flame and suffocate or consume the wisest, body and trunk. As wood nurses
fire to flame, so incendiary speeches precipitate war, and in astonishment I
ask, is the family of Omayyah awake or asleep?”</p>

<p>After Nasr had suffered numerous attacks from Abu Muslim he received
from the caliph reinforcements under the general Nabata. But when the
latter with ten thousand Syrians was defeated by Abu Muslim’s forces, under
Kahtaba Nasr fled with the rest of his troops to Hamadan. He did not
live to reach the ancient city, and his successor to the governorship surrendered
to Kahtaba who was just returning from a second victory near
Ispahan, on condition that himself and his Syrian followers should receive
full pardon. The black flag of Abbasids now waved in all the lands east of
the Tigris, and for the family of Omayyah the decisive hour had arrived.
Kahtaba perished on the blood-soaked battle-field of Kerbela; but his son
Hasan, who succeeded his father to the command, completely defeated the
Syrian army, which was led by the brave governor Hobaira. It was now
the turn of Cufa to display the black banner and in that city Abul-Abbas, the
head of the Abbasids, was proclaimed caliph.</p>

<p>When the news of these events reached the warlike Merwan, he gathered
together his entire military force and after causing Ibrahim, the eldest of
the Abbasid brothers, to be put to death in his prison at Haram, advanced
to meet the enemy. On the river Zab, not far from the ruins of Nineveh,
where once in the neighbourhood of Arbela and Gaugamela the fate of
the Persian kingdom and its reigning house had been decided, took place the
great battle which wrested from the Omayyads the sceptre of supremacy in
the East, and gave the first impulse toward the dissolution of the entire
kingdom (January 25th, 750). Fortune which had so long been favourable
to Merwan now deserted him; beset by treachery and ill-chance, he fled
from the battle-field to Hims and Damascus, whither but few of the soldiers
that made up his mighty forces could follow him, those who escaped the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
sword of the enemy finding death in the waters of the stream. Abdallah
then began a triumphal march through all the towns and countries that lay
between Mosul and Syria. Merwan, after having appointed his son-in-law
Walid governor, fled at his approach to Palestine. Here he learned that
the black flag was also flying in Damascus, where the terrible Abdallah,
nicknamed “As-Saffan, the Shedder of Blood,” had celebrated his entrance
by putting to death the newly appointed governor Walid, and he again
sought flight&mdash;into Egypt this time. But insurrection had reached even the
peaceful Nile valley, and in an unsuccessful engagement with the opposing
factionists Merwan II came to a violent end while seeking refuge in a church
at Busir, in Upper Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[661-750 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>With Merwan’s death the last support to the unity of the kingdom was
removed. Weak and unpopular as were many of the rulers of the Omayyad
dynasty, their sway nevertheless extended from the Indus and the Iaxartes
to the western coast of the Pyrenean peninsula, and from the Caucasus to
the Bay of Aden. Sole founders and perpetuators of the Islamite kingdom
in the three divisions of the ancient world, the early fame of the Omayyads
served to gloss over many a fault in their later representatives, lending a
lustre to their names which according to their contemporaries did not rightfully
belong to them. Now that Abul-Abbas had become established in
Damascus, the central point round which the whole political life of the
Moslems had revolved was lost; and Islamism was henceforth to break up
into ever widening smaller circles in which each unit was free to develop
individually, until the Mohammedan world should be again reduced to that
condition of dismemberment which had at first prevailed among the tribes of
the Arabian peninsula. There were indeed among the caliphs of Damascus
some to whom virtues and the ability to rule were not denied by later
writers. Omar II’s piety and love of justice, and the court life of Yazid II,
bright with all the lustre that benevolence, poetry, and brilliant feasts could
shed upon it, received full meed of praise from poets and true believers.
By borrowing from the Byzantines their methods of administration and their
Greek-Roman culture, by attracting to their court physicians, architects,
and mathematicians, and enriching the simple life of the inhabitants of the
desert with the arts and conveniences of civilisation, they showed future
rulers how to weld together native and foreign constituents so that great
results might be obtained, to unite many and diverse elements into one
specific whole. But a stain rested upon the name of the Omayyads that,
in the opinion of true believers, could never be wiped away. The blood of
Ali and his family still dyed their hands, they had driven the sacred line
of Mohammed from the seat of honour, and they had covered the head of
Hosein with ridicule and contempt. These sins could not be expiated by
any single act; they constituted a perpetual curse that must descend from
one generation to another of the race, dividing families by dissensions and
internal feuds until the whole dynasty should finally be overthrown.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_6d"><a href="#parthians_endnote_6d">d</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII. THE ARABS IN EUROPE</h3>

<div class="sidenote">[711-961 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the progress of conquest from the north and south, the Goths and the
Saracens encountered each other on the confines of Europe and Africa. In
the opinion of the latter, the difference of religion is a reasonable ground of
enmity and warfare. As early as the time of Othman, their piratical squadrons
had ravaged the coasts of Andalusia; nor had they forgotten the relief
of Carthage by the Gothic succours. In that age, as well as in the present, the
kings of Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta; one of the columns
of Hercules, which is divided by a narrow strait from the opposite pillar
or point of Europe. A small portion of Mauretania was still wanting to
the African conquest; but Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed from the
walls of Ceuta by the vigilance and courage of Count Julian, the general of
the Goths. From his disappointment and perplexity Musa was relieved by
an unexpected message from the Christian chief, who offered his place, his
person, and his sword, to the successors of Mohammed, and solicited the disgraceful
honour of introducing their arms into the heart of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[711 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>If we inquire into the cause of his treachery, the Spaniards will repeat the
popular story of his daughter La Cava, of a virgin who was seduced, or ravished,
by her sovereign; of a father who sacrificed his religion and country to
the thirst of revenge. The passions of princes have often been licentious and
destructive; but this well-known tale, romantic in itself, is indifferently supported
by external evidence; and the history of Spain will suggest some
motives of interest and policy more congenial to the breast of a veteran statesman.
After the decease or deposition of Witiza, his two sons were supplanted
by the ambition of Roderic, a noble Goth, whose father, the duke or governor
of a province, had fallen a victim to the preceding tyranny. The
monarchy was still elective; but the sons of Witiza, educated on the steps of
the throne, were impatient of a private station. Their resentment was more
dangerous, as it was varnished with the dissimulation of courts; their followers
were excited by the remembrance of favours and the promise of a revolution;
and their uncle Oppas, archbishop of Toledo and Seville, was the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
person in the church, and the second in the state. It is probable that Julian
was involved in the disgrace of the unsuccessful faction; that he had little to
hope and much to fear from the new reign; and that the imprudent king
could not forget or forgive the injuries which Roderic and his family had
sustained. Too feeble to meet his sovereign in arms, he sought the aid of a
foreign power; and his rash invitation to the Moors and Arabs produced
the calamities of eight hundred years. In his epistles, or in a personal interview,
he revealed the wealth and nakedness of his country; the weakness of
an unpopular prince; the degeneracy of an effeminate people.</p>

<p>The Goths were no longer the victorious barbarians who had humbled
the pride of Rome, despoiled the queen of nations, and penetrated from the
Danube to the Atlantic Ocean. Secluded from the world by the Pyrenean
Mountains, the successors of Alaric had slumbered in a long peace; the walls
of the cities were mouldered into dust; the youth had abandoned the exercise
of arms; and the presumption of their ancient renown would expose
them in a field of battle to the first assault of the invaders. The ambitious
Saracen was fired by the ease and importance of the attempt; but the execution
was delayed till he had consulted the commander of the faithful; and his
messenger returned with the permission of Walid to annex the unknown
kingdoms of the West to the religion and throne of the caliphs. In his
residence of Tangier, Musa, with secrecy and caution, continued his correspondence
and hastened his preparations. But the remorse of the conspirators
was soothed by the fallacious assurance that he should content himself with
the glory and spoil, without aspiring to establish the Moslems beyond the sea
that separates Africa from Europe.</p>

<p>Before Musa would trust an army of the faithful to the traitors and infidels
of a foreign land, he made a less dangerous trial of their strength and
veracity. One hundred Arabs, and four hundred Africans passed over in four
vessels from Tangier, or Ceuta; the place of their descent on the opposite
shore of the strait is marked by the name of Tarik their chief; and the date
of this memorable event is fixed to the month of Ramadhan, of the ninety-first
year of the Hegira. Their hospitable entertainment, the Christians who
joined their standard, their inroad into a fertile and unguarded province, the
richness of their spoil and the safety of their return, announced to their
brethren the most favourable omens of victory. In the ensuing spring,
five thousand veterans and volunteers were embarked under the command
of Tarik, a dauntless and skilful soldier, who surpassed the expectation of his
chief; and the necessary transports were provided by the industry of their too
faithful ally.</p>

<p>The Saracens landed at the pillar or point of Europe; the corrupt and
familiar appellation of Gibraltar (<i>Jebel at-Tarik</i>) describes the mountain
of Tarik; and the entrenchments of his camp were the first outline of those
fortifications, which, in the hands of the British, have resisted the art and
power of the house of Bourbon. The adjacent governors informed the court
of Toledo of the descent and progress of the Arabs; and the defeat of his
lieutenant Edeco, who had been commanded to seize and bind the presumptuous
strangers, admonished Roderic of the magnitude of the danger. At the royal
summons, the dukes, and counts, the bishops and nobles of the Gothic monarchy,
assembled at the head of their followers; and the title of king of the
Romans, which is employed by an Arabic historian, may be excused by the
close affinity of language, religion, and manners, between the nations of Spain.</p>

<p>His army consisted of ninety or a hundred thousand men; a formidable
power, if their fidelity and discipline had been adequate to their numbers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
The troops of Tarik had been augmented to twelve thousand Saracens; but
the Christian malcontents were attracted by the influence of Julian, and a
crowd of Africans most greedily tasted the temporal blessings of the <i>Koran</i>.
In the neighbourhood of Cadiz, the town of Xeres has been illustrated by
the encounter which determined the fate of the kingdom; the stream of the
Guadalete, which falls into the bay, divided the two camps, and marked
the advancing and retreating skirmishes of three successive and bloody days.
On the fourth day, the two armies joined a more serious and decisive issue;
but Alaric would have blushed at the sight of his unworthy successor, sustaining
on his head a diadem of pearls, encumbered with a flowing robe of
gold and silken embroidery, and reclining on a litter, or car of ivory, drawn
by two white mules. Notwithstanding the valour of the Saracens, they
fainted under the weight of multitudes, and the plain of Xeres was overspread
with sixteen thousand of their dead bodies. “My brethren,” said Tarik to
his surviving companions, “the enemy is before you, the sea is behind; whither
would ye fly? Follow your general; I am resolved either to lose my life, or
to trample on the prostrate king of the Romans.” Besides the resource of
despair, he confided in the secret correspondence and nocturnal interviews
of Count Julian with the sons and the brother of Witiza. The two princes
and the archbishop of Toledo occupied the most important post; their well-timed
defection broke the ranks of the Christians; each warrior was prompted
by fear or suspicion to consult his personal safety; and the remains of the
Gothic army were scattered or destroyed in the flight and pursuit of the three
following days. Amidst the general disorder, Roderick started from his car,
and mounted Orelia, the fleetest of his horses; but he escaped from a soldier’s
death to perish more ignobly in the waters of the Bætis or Guadalquivir.
His diadem, his robes, and his courser, were found on the bank; but as the
body of the Gothic prince was lost in the waves, the pride and ignorance
of the caliph must have been gratified with some meaner head, which was
exposed in triumph before the palace of Damascus.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> “And such,” continues
a valiant historian<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_7b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_7b">b</a></span> of the Arabs, “is the fate of those kings who withdraw
themselves from a field of battle.”</p>

<p>Count Julian had plunged so deep into guilt and infamy, that his only
hope was in the ruin of his country. After the battle of Xeres he recommended
the most effectual measures to the victorious Saracen. Tarik listened to
his advice. A Roman captive and proselyte, who had been enfranchised
by the caliph himself, assaulted Cordova with seven hundred horse; he swam
the river, surprised the town, and drove the Christians into the great church,
where they defended themselves above three months. Another detachment
reduced the seacoast of Bætica. The march of Tarik was directed through
the Sierra Morena, that separates Andalusia and Castile, till he appeared in
arms under the walls of Toledo. The most zealous of the Catholics had escaped
with the relics of their saints; and if the gates were shut it was only till the
victor had subscribed a fair and reasonable capitulation. But if the justice of
Tarik protected the Christians, his gratitude and policy rewarded the Jews, to
whose secret or open aid he was indebted for his most important acquisitions.
Persecuted by the kings and synods of Spain, who had often pressed the alternative
of banishment or baptism, that outcast nation embraced the moment of
revenge; the comparison of their past and present state was the pledge of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
fidelity; and the alliance between the disciples of Moses and of Mohammed
was maintained till the final era of their common expulsion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[711-713 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the royal seat of Toledo, the Arabian leader spread his conquests
to the north, over the modern realms of Castile and Leon; but it is needless to
enumerate the cities that yielded on his approach, or again to describe the table
of emerald, transported from the East by the Romans, acquired by the Goths
among the spoils of Rome, and presented by the Arabs to the throne of
Damascus. Beyond the Asturian mountains, the maritime town of Gijon was
the term of the lieutenant of Musa, who had performed, with the speed of a
traveller, his victorious march of seven hundred miles, from the rock of Gibraltar
to the Bay of Biscay. The failure of land
compelled him to retreat; and he was recalled
to Toledo to excuse his presumption of subduing
a kingdom in the absence of his general.</p>

<p>Spain, which, in a more savage and disorderly
state, had resisted two hundred years
the arms of the Romans, was overrun in a few
months by those of the Saracens; and such was
the eagerness of submission and treaty, that the
governor of Cordova is recorded as the only
chief who fell, without conditions, a prisoner
into their hands. The cause of the Goths had
been irrevocably judged in the field of Xeres;
and, in the national dismay, each part of the
monarchy declined a contest with the antagonist
who had vanquished the united strength of the
whole. Yet a spark of the vital flame was still
alive; some invincible fugitives preferred a life
of poverty and freedom in the Asturian valleys;
the hardy mountaineer repulsed the slaves of
the caliph; and the sword of Pelagius (Pelayo)
has been transformed into the sceptre of the
Catholic kings.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p194.jpg" width="150" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Saracen Chief</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the intelligence of his rapid success, the
applause of Musa degenerated into envy; and
he began, not to complain but to fear, that
Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue. At
the head of ten thousand Arabs and eight thousand
Africans, he passed over in person from
Mauretania to Spain; the first of his companions
were the noblest of the Koreish; his eldest son
was left in the command of Africa; the three younger brethren were of an age
and spirit to second the boldest enterprises of their father. Some enemies
yet remained for the sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths
had compared their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities from
which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as impregnable;
and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications of Seville and Merida.
They were successively besieged and reduced by the labour of Musa, who
transported his camp from the Bætis to the Anas, from the Guadalquivir
to the Guadiana. When he beheld the works of Roman magnificence, the
bridge, the aqueducts, the triumphal arches, and the theatre, of the ancient
metropolis of Lusitania, “I should imagine,” said he to his four companions,
“that the human race must have united their art and power in the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
of this city; happy is the man who shall become its master!” The defence of
Merida was obstinate and long; and the castle of the martyrs was a perpetual
testimony of the losses of the Moslems. The constancy of the besieged
was at length subdued by famine and despair; and the prudent victor disguised
his impatience under the names of clemency and esteem. The alternative
of exile or tribute was allowed; the churches were divided between
the two religions; and the wealth of those who had fallen in the siege, or
retired to Galicia, was confiscated as the reward of the faithful.</p>

<p>In the midway between Merida and Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa
saluted the vicegerent of the caliph, and conducted him to the palace of the
Gothic kings. Their first interview was cold and formal; a rigid account
was exacted of the treasures of Spain; the character of Tarik was exposed
to suspicion and obloquy; and the hero was imprisoned, reviled, and ignominiously
scourged by the hand, or the command, of Musa. Yet so strict
was the discipline, so pure the zeal, or so tame the spirit, of the primitive
Moslems, that after this public indignity, Tarik could serve and be trusted
in the reduction of the Tarragonese province. A mosque was erected at
Saragossa, by the liberality of the Koreish; the port of Barcelona was opened
to the vessels of Syria; and the Goths were pursued beyond the Pyrenean
Mountains into their Gallic province of Septimania or Languedoc. In the
church of St. Mary at Carcassonne, Musa found, but it is improbable that he
left, seven equestrian statues of massy silver; and from his <i>term</i> or column
of Narbonne, he returned on his footsteps to the Galician and Lusitanian
shores of the ocean. During the absence of the father, the son Abdul-Aziz
chastised the insurgents of Seville, and reduced, from Malaga to Valencia,
the seacoast of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Theodemir and his subjects were treated with uncommon lenity; but the
rate of tribute appears to have fluctuated from a tenth to a fifth, according
to the submission or obstinacy of the Christians. In this revolution, many
partial calamities were inflicted by the carnal or religious passions of the
enthusiasts; some churches were profaned by the new worship; some relics
or images were confounded with idols; the rebels were put to the sword;
and one town (an obscure place between Cordova and Seville) was razed to
its foundations. Yet if we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths,
or its recovery by the kings of Castile and Aragon, we must applaud the
moderation and discipline of the Arabian conquerors.</p>

<p>The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life, though he
affected to disguise his age by colouring with a red powder the whiteness of
his beard. But in the love of action and glory, his breast was still fired
with the ardour of youth; and the possession of Spain was considered only
as the first step to the monarchy of Europe. With a powerful armament by
sea and land, he was preparing to repass the Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul
and Italy the declining kingdoms of the Franks and Lombards, and to
preach the unity of God on the altar of the Vatican. From thence subduing
the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed to follow the course of the Danube
from its source to the Euxine Sea, to overthrow the Greek or Roman Empire
of Constantinople, and, returning from Europe to Asia, to unite his new
acquisitions with Antioch and the provinces of Syria. But his vast enterprise,
perhaps of easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar
minds; and the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependence
and servitude.</p>

<p>The friends of Tarik had effectually stated his services and wrongs; at
the court of Damascus, the proceedings of Musa were blamed, his intentions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
were suspected, and his delay in complying with the first invitation was
chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. An intrepid messenger
of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Galicia, and in the presence
of the Saracens and Christians arrested the bridle of his horse. His own
loyalty, or that of his troops, inculcated the duty of obedience; and his disgrace
was alleviated by the recall of his rival, and the permission of investing
with his two governments his two sons, Abdallah and Abdul-Aziz. His
long triumph, from Ceuta to Damascus, displayed the spoils of Africa and
the treasures of Spain; four hundred Gothic nobles, with gold coronets
and girdles, were distinguished in his train; and the number of male and
female captives, selected for their birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen,
or even at thirty, thousand persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[713-722 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Ten years after the conquest, a map of the province was presented to the
caliph&mdash;the seas, the rivers, and the harbours, the inhabitants and cities,
the climate, the soil, and the mineral productions of the earth. In the space
of two centuries the gifts of nature were improved by the agriculture, the
manufactures, and the commerce of an industrious people; and the effects
of their diligence have been magnified by the idleness of their fancy. The
first of the Omayyads who reigned in Spain solicited the support of the Christians;
and, in his edict of peace and protection, he contents himself with a
modest imposition of ten thousand ounces of gold, ten thousand pounds of
silver, ten thousand horses, as many mules, one thousand cuirasses, with an
equal number of helmets and lances. The most powerful of his successors
derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of twelve millions and
forty-five thousand dinars or pieces of gold, about six millions of sterling
money; a sum which, in the tenth century, most probably surpassed
the united revenues of the Christian monarchs. His royal seat of Cordova
contained six hundred mosques, nine hundred baths, and two hundred thousand
houses; he gave laws to eighty cities of the first, to three hundred of
the second and third order: and the fertile banks of the Guadalquivir were
adorned with twelve thousand villages and hamlets. The Arabs might
exaggerate the truth, but they created and they describe the most prosperous
era of the riches, the cultivation, and the populousness of Spain.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_7c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_7c">c</a></span></p>

<p>Musa did not reach Syria until the close of the year 714. Walid Abul-Abbas
was on the bed of death; and Suleiman, the brother and heir of the
caliph, wrote to the emir, commanding him not to approach the expiring
sovereign, but to delay his entrance into Damascus until the opening of
a new reign. Suleiman doubtless wished that the pomp of the spectacle
should grace his own accession, and that the treasures now brought should
not run the risk of dispersion by his brother. But Musa imprudently disregarded
the command; perhaps he dreaded the fate which would await him
for his delay should Walid recover; and he proceeded to the palace. That
prince, however, in a few days bade adieu to empire and to life, and Musa
remained exposed to the vengeance of Suleiman. He was cast into prison;
was beaten with rods, while made to stand a whole day before the gate of
the palace; and lastly was fined in so heavy a sum, that, unless his wealth
were exhaustless, he must have been impoverished.</p>

<p>While Musa was thus deservedly punished for his rapacity and injustice,
his son Abdul-Aziz was actively employed in finishing the subjugation of the
peninsula. But one step, which he doubtless expected would strengthen
his influence with both Arabs and natives, was the occasion of his downfall.
Smitten with the charms of Egilona, the widow of Roderic, he made her
first his concubine, next his wife; and it is probable that through the counsels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
of that ambitious and unprincipled woman, he aimed at an independent
sovereignty. Besides, Suleiman might well apprehend the open rebellion
of the son, on learning the story of the father’s harsh fate. To prevent the
consequences which he dreaded might arise from the indignation of this
powerful family, he despatched secret orders for the deposition and death of
the three brothers. And Abdul-Aziz, while assisting at morning prayers
in the mosque of Seville, fell beneath the poniards of the assassins. After
this bloody execution, so characteristic of Mussulman government, Habib
ben Obaid departed with the head of the emir to the court of Damascus.
It was shown to Musa by the caliph, who at the same time asked him
with a bitter smile, if he recognised it. The old man, who recognised it too
well, turned away his shuddering looks, and fearlessly exclaimed, “Cursed
be he who has destroyed a better man than himself!” He then left the
palace and betook himself to the deserts of Arabia, where the grief of having
thus lost his children soon brought him broken-hearted to the grave.</p>

<p>Severe as were the afflictions of Musa, and execrable as was the manner
in which those afflictions were brought upon him, it is impossible to feel
much pity for his fate. Of envy, rapacity, and injustice, he has been proved
abundantly guilty; and though little is said of his cruelty by Arabic writers
who lived long after his time, it is no less indisputable from the testimony
of contemporary Christian historians. The horrors which he perpetrated in
his career of conquest, or rather of extermination, have been compared to
those of Troy and of Jerusalem, and to the worst atrocities of the persecuting
heathen emperors. There may be exaggeration in the declamatory
statements of those historians, but the very exaggeration must be admitted
to prove the melancholy fact. The execution of Abdul-Aziz produced a
great consternation in the minds of the natives.</p>

<p>The Arab sheikhs assembled to invest one of their body with the high
dignity. The virtues and wisdom of Ayub ben Habib, the nephew of Musa,
commanded their unanimous suffrages. But Omar II, the successor of
Suleiman, disdaining to recognise a governor not appointed by the sovereign
authority of the caliph, deposed Ayub and nominated Al-Haur ben Abd ar-Rahman
to the viceregal dignity. Not even the rich booty which he collected
during an irruption into Gothic Gaul, could, it is said, satisfy his rapacity;
and he extorted heavy sums from the people. But what added most to the
discontent of the Arabs was the defeat of his general Al-Kama, who had
ventured to penetrate into the mountain fastnesses of the Asturias, to crush
the infant power of Pelayo. [See the later volume on Spain.]</p>

<p>Yazid, the successor of Omar, replaced Al-Haur by As-Sama ben Malik
[or Assan], 721 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> At the head of a considerable force, he passed the
Pyrenees, took Carcassonne, reduced Narbonne, and laid siege to Toulouse,
which made a noble resistance until Eudes, duke of Aquitaine, hastened to
its relief. A bloody battle was fought under the walls of that city, fatal
to the hopes of the Moslems. Their emir, their sheikhs, and many thousands
of their number, were left on the field; perhaps few would have escaped,
but for the courageous address of Abd ar-Rahman, the lieutenant of the deceased
chief, who rallied the remains of the troops, and safely effected
a retreat to Narbonne.</p>

<p>The grateful remnant immediately invested Abd ar-Rahman ben Abdallah
with the government of Spain; and the election was confirmed by the emir
of Africa. But Ambasa succeeded, by criminal intrigues, in procuring the
deposition of this favourite chief and his own nomination. Carcassonne and
Nîmes vainly attempted to resist him. In the midst of his success, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
death surprised him; and, at his own request, Odsra ben Abdallah was
permitted to succeed him, but was speedily replaced by Yahya ben Salma. So
loud, however, were the complaints that the African emir was obliged to
depose him, and to nominate in his room Othman ben Abi Neza, better
known to the readers both of history and romance as Manuza. But in a
very few months this emir was replaced by another; and the latter was as
summarily removed to make way for the Syrian Al-Haitam ben Obaid. At
the end of two months, Abd ar-Rahman, the predecessor of Ambasa, was again
invested with the viceregal dignity&mdash;an appointment which gave the highest

<div class="sidenote">[722-732 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This celebrated emir commenced his second administration by distributing
justice so impartially, that the professors of neither faith could find
reason to complain. But these cares could not long divert him from the
great design he had formed&mdash;that of invading the whole of Gaul. Though
the Arabic historians conceal the extent of the preparations, for the natural
purpose of palliating the disgrace of failure, there can be no doubt that those
preparations were on an immense scale; that the true believers flocked to
the white standard<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> from the farthest parts of the caliph’s dominions; and
that the whole Mohammedan world contemplated the expedition with intense
anxiety.</p>

<p>Just before the Mussulman army commenced its march, Othman, who
still continued at his station in Gothic Gaul, very near to the Pyrenees,
received orders to lay waste the province of Aquitaine. But Othman, or
Manuza, was in no disposition to execute the order; he had seen with envy
Abd ar-Rahman preferred to himself; and his marriage with one of the
daughters of Eudes, duke of Aquitaine, whom he passionately loved, rendered
him more eager to cultivate the friendship than to incur the hostility of the
Franks. In this perplexity, Othman acquainted Eudes with the meditated
assault, and thereby enabled that chief to meet it. Abd ar-Rahman instantly
despatched a select body of troops under one of his confidential generals, to
watch the movements, and, if necessary, to punish the treason, of Othman,
who, with his beautiful princess, sought for safety in flight. He was
overtaken in the Pyrenees, while resting during the heat of the day beside a
fountain. His head was sent to the emir, and his bride to end her days in
the harem of Damascus.</p>

<p>Abd ar-Rahman now commenced his momentous march, in the hope of
carrying the banner of the prophet to the very shores of the Baltic. His
progress spread dismay throughout Europe; and well it might, for so formidable
and destructive an armament Europe had not seen since the days of
Attila. Conflagrations, ruins, the shrieks of violated chastity, and the groans
of the dying, rendered this memorable invasion more like the work of a
demon than of a man. The flourishing towns of southern and central France,
from Gascony to Burgundy, and from the Garonne to the Loire, were soon
transformed into smoking heaps. In vain did Eudes strive to arrest the
overpowering torrent, by disputing the passage of the Dordogne; his army
was swept before it, and he himself was compelled to become a suppliant to
his enemy the mayor of the Franks. That celebrated hero, Charles Martel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
whose actions, administration, and numerous victories commanded the just
admiration of the times, was no less anxious to become the saviour of Christendom;
but he knew too well the magnitude of the danger to meet it by
premature efforts; and he silently collected in Belgium and in Germany the
elements of resistance to the dreaded inundation. When his measures were
taken, he boldly advanced at the head of his combined Franks, Belgians,
Germans, etc., towards the enemy, who had just reduced Tours, and who was
soon drawn up to receive him in the extended plain between that city and
Poitiers. After six days’ skirmishing, both advanced to the shock. The
contest was long and bloody; the utmost
valour was displayed by the two armies,
and the utmost ability by the two captains;
but in the end, the impenetrable ranks,
robust frames, and iron hands of the Germans
turned the fortune of the day. When
darkness arrived, an immense number of
Saracen bodies, among which was that of
Abd ar-Rahman himself, covered the plain.
Still the misbelievers were formidable alike
from their numbers and from their possible
despair; and the victors remained in their
tents, under arms, during the night. At
break of day they prepared to renew the
struggle; the white tents of the Arabs, extending
as far as the eye could reach,
appeared before them, but not a living
creature came out to meet them. It was
at length discovered that the enemy had
abandoned their camp, their own wealth,
and the immense plunder they had amassed;
and had silently, though precipitately, withdrawn
from the field. Christendom was
saved; pope and monk, prince and peasant,
in an ecstasy of grateful devotion, hastened
to the churches, to thank heaven for a
victory which, however dearly it had been
purchased by the true servants of God, had
inflicted so signal a blow on the misbelievers,
that their return was no longer dreaded.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A French Soldier of the Eighth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>This far-famed victory, which was
obtained in the year 732, spread consternation
throughout the whole Mohammedan world. Fortunately for
Christendom, the domestic quarrels of the Mussulmans themselves, the
fierce struggles of their chiefs for the seat of the prophet, prevented them
from universally arming to vindicate their faith and their martial reputation.
Abdul-Malik ben Khotan was nominated by the African emir to succeed
Abd ar-Rahman and to revenge the late disasters. The emir passed the Pyrenees;
but a complete panic seemed to have seized on his followers, who soon
retreated, but were pursued and destroyed. He was superseded by Okba
ben al-Hajjaj. Feeling his mind and body alike exhausted by his harassing
duties, he applied to the caliph for the restoration of Abdul-Malik.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[733-755 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The restored emir had little reason to congratulate himself on his good
fortune. The restless barbarians of Mauretania again revolted, and defeated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
and slew their governor who hastened to subdue them. The Syrians, under
Thalaba ben Salama, and the Egyptians under Balej ben Besher, were expelled
from the country, and induced to seek refuge in Spain. Their arrival
boded no good to the tranquillity of the peninsula. Abdul-Malik tried
negotiation in vain; the Africans invested him in his last hold, and the inhabitants
hoping to obtain favour by his destruction, tied him to a post on the
bridge of Cordova, and opened their gates to Balej. The unfortunate emir
was speedily beheaded, and the inhuman victor tumultuously proclaimed
the governor of the faithful.</p>

<p>Balej did not long enjoy his usurped honours. Offended at the preference
thus shown to another, Thalaba unexpectedly became the advocate of
subordination. At the same time the son of Okba rallied the dispersed
troops of the murdered Abdul-Malik, and marched against the usurper.
Balej fell, pierced by the scimitar of Abd ar-Rahman; the tyrant’s forces fled,
and the victor was hailed by the honourable surname of Al-Mansur. Thalaba
from his viceregal throne was removed to a dungeon in the fortress of Tangier.
Husam was not destined to be more fortunate than his predecessors.
He was deposed by Thueba.</p>

<p>During scenes of anarchy and of blood, there was a third party, which
took no part in them, and which groaned over the disasters of this fertile
land. It was agreed that the only means of ending the existing anarchy
was to appoint an emir with sovereign power over the whole peninsula.
After some deliberation the choice unanimously fell on Yusuf al-Fehri, of the
tribe of Koreish, which was also that of the prophet. Yusuf was now compelled
to enter on a ruinous civil war; and ruinous it was beyond example
in this ill-fated country. To describe the horrors which ensued is impossible;
it seemed as if one half of Spain had risen for no other purpose than that
of exterminating the other half, and of transforming the whole country into a
desert. Many cities, to say nothing of inferior towns and villages, disappeared
forever from the face of the peninsula; leaving, however, melancholy
mementos of their past existence in the ruins which remained.</p>

<p>Above forty years had now elapsed since the first descent of the Mohammedans;
and in the whole of that period there had been but few intervals
of tranquillity, or even of individual security. So mutable had been the government,
that twenty different emirs had been called, or had raised themselves,
to direct it. About eighty chiefs secretly assembled at Cordova;
when, laying aside all private ambition, they consulted as to the means of
ending the civil war. They were addressed by Hayut of Emessa, who
reminded them of the recent usurpation of the Abbasids; of the consequent
massacre of the Omayyads; and, what was still more melancholy, of
the fatal divisions among the partisans of those families throughout the Mohammedan
world, and of the anarchy which was the inevitable result of those
divisions. These chiefs agreed to establish a separate, independent monarchy,
but the main difficulty still remained. What individual could be
found in whose claims a whole nation could be likely to acquiesce, and who
possessed the requisites towards that nation’s prosperity? It was removed
by Wahib ben Zair, whose interesting relation is thus abridged:</p>

<div class="sidenote">[750-778 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After the tragic massacre of the Omayyads, two sons of Merwan, the last
caliph of that house, who had been so fortunate as to escape the destruction
of their brethren, were foolish enough to reside at the court of Abul-Abbas,
on his solemnly promising to spare their lives. Yielding at length to the
repeated insinuations of a base spy, Abul-Abbas ordered their execution.
Soliman, the eldest, was immediately taken and slain; but the other, Abd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
ar-Rahman, who was fortunately absent from Damascus, was seasonably informed
of this second tragedy. Hastily furnishing himself with horses and
money, he commenced his flight from Syria. He chose the most unfrequented
paths, and safely arrived among the Bedouin Arabs. From Arabia
he passed through Egypt into Africa, where new dangers awaited him.
After some days of a fatiguing journey through boundless plains of sand, he
reached Tahart in Mauretania, by the inhabitants of which he was received
with joy. “Abd ar-Rahman,” concluded Wahib, “still remains there; let him
be our sovereign!”</p>

<p>The proposal of the sheikh was received with unanimous applause. Accompanied
by Teman ben Al-Kama, he was instantly deputed by the assembly to
pass over into Mauretania, and offer the crown to the princely descendant of
Moawiyah. The prince immediately accepted the proposal. The youth of
the whole tribe were eager to accompany him, but he selected 750 well-armed
horsemen for this arduous expedition. Abd ar-Rahman landed on the coast
of Andalusia in the early part of the year 755. The inhabitants of that
province, sheikhs and people, received him with open arms, and made the air
ring with their acclamations. His appearance, his station, his majestic
mien, his open countenance, won upon the multitude even more perhaps
than the prospect of the blessings which he was believed to have in store for
them. His march to Seville was one continued triumph; twenty thousand
voices cheered his progress; twenty thousand scimitars, wielded by vigorous
hands, were at his disposal. The surrounding towns immediately sent
deputies with their submission and the offer of their services. After a series
of unsuccessful manœuvres, Yusuf fell in a battle near Lorca, and his head
was sent by the victorious general to the king. According to the barbarous
custom of the times, it was suspended from an iron hook over one of the public
gates of Cordova. The very same year Narbonne fell into the power of the
Christians, after a siege of six years. Gothic Gaul was now lost to the Moslems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[756-796 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The peace which the monarch enjoyed was destined to prove of short
duration. While he continued at Seville, indulging alike in poetry and
friendship, he received intelligence of an insurrection at Toledo, by Hisham
ben Adri al-Fehri, a relative of Yusuf. Hisham with some other generals
fell into the hands of Bedra, who, in the fear of their being saved by the
clemency of Abd ar-Rahman, immediately struck off their heads. But he
was now menaced by an enemy more powerful than any which had yet
assailed him; and one of the last perhaps he would ever have dreamed of
opposing. This was no other than Charlemagne, who poured his legions
over the Pyrenees into the valleys of Catalonia. He himself headed the
division which passed into Navarre through Gascony, and his first conquest
was the Christian city of Pamplona. The walls he levelled with the ground;
and thence proceeded to Saragossa. That city quickly owned his supremacy;
and so also, we are told, did Gerona, Huesca, and Barcelona, the government
of which he confided to the sheikhs who had invited him into the
peninsula, and had aided him with their influence. The whole country, from
the Ebro to the Pyrenees, in like manner owned his authority. How far
he might have carried his arms, had not the revolt of the Saxons summoned
him to a more urgent scene, it would be useless to conjecture.</p>

<p>While in the defiles of the Pyrenees, between Roncesvalles and Valcarlos,
his rear was furiously assailed by some thousands of Navarrese in ambush,
who were justly indignant at the wanton destruction of their capital. That
the injury inflicted on the emperor was serious, is apparent from the words
of his own secretary, who tells us that the whole rearguard was cut to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
pieces, including many of his generals and chief nobles; and that not only
the riches amassed in the expedition, but the whole baggage of the army,
fell into the hands of the victors. Scarcely had Charlemagne passed the
Pyrenees, when Abd ar-Rahman recovered Saragossa and the other places, of
which that monarch had received the submission, and which he had, probably,
been sanguine enough to hope would continue to acknowledge his
supremacy. But if Abd ar-Rahman was thus freed from so formidable an
invader, he was still subject to the curse of domestic sedition.</p>

<p>During his long reign, Abd ar-Rahman had several transactions with the
Christians of the Asturias. Under the viceroys his predecessors, the Mussulman
arms had failed against both Pelayo and Alfonso I; but he was more
successful. By Froila or Fruela I, indeed, one if not two of his generals
were successively and signally defeated (760 and 761); but from the tenor
of a treaty between the two kings, a treaty on which the early Christian
writers preserve a deep silence, we may infer either that the Asturian ruler
had sustained some reverse, or that he turned aside the storm of threatening
vengeance by concessions.</p>

<p>Abd ar-Rahman died in 787. The chief features of his character were
honour, generosity, and intrepidity, with a deeply rooted regard for the
interests of justice and religion. His views, for a Mussulman, were enlightened,
and his sentiments liberal. Misfortune had been his schoolmaster, and
he profited by its lessons. He was an encourager of literature, as appears
from the number of schools he founded and endowed; of poetry in particular
he must have been fond, or he would not have cultivated it himself. In
short, his highest praise is to be found in the fact that Mohammedan Spain
wanted a hero and legislator to lay the first stone of her prosperity, and that
she found both in him.</p>

<p>Hisham ben Abd ar-Rahman, surnamed Alhadi Radhi, the Just and the
Good, was immediately proclaimed at Merida, whither he had accompanied his
dying father; and his elevation was hailed by the acclamations of all Spain.
The success with which Hisham crushed formidable insurrections of his
two brothers roused within him the latent sparks of ambition. He now
aspired to conquests not only in the Asturias, but in Gothic Gaul. He proclaimed
the <i>al-jihed</i>, or holy war, which every Mussulman was bound to
aid, if young, by personal service, if rich and advanced in years, by the contribution
of horses, arms, or money. Two formidable armies were immediately
put in motion; one thirty-nine thousand strong, which was headed by
the hajib or prime minister, marched into the Asturias; the other, which
was still more numerous, advanced towards the Pyrenees. The hajib laid
waste all Galicia as far as Lugo, and obtained immense plunder; but
Alfonso, surnamed the Chaste, had the glory of freeing the infant kingdom
from the invaders. A second expedition, under the hajib’s son, was still
more unfortunate. From this time may be dated the real independence of
the Christians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[796-815 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The success of the other army was not very signal; it made no conquests,
but shortly returned across the Pyrenees laden with immense plunder. In
the seventh year of his reign Hisham caused his son Al-Hakem to be recognised
as his successor, and died a few months afterwards, in 796, universally
lamented by his subjects. The reign of Al-Hakem was one of extreme
agitation. Barcelona, and many other fortresses of Catalonia, acknowledged
the supremacy of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Whilst these transactions were passing in Catalonia, Alfonso the Chaste
was naturally eager to profit by the division in his favour. To punish his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
revolt in 801, Al-Hakem ravaged his eastern territories. But on the return
of the Mohammedan king, who left Yusuf ben Amru to prosecute the war,
the Asturian entirely routed the forces of that general, whom he took
prisoner, and for whose ransom he exacted a heavy sum. This very fact
proves that the two kings were now placed on an equal footing&mdash;that the
ties of vassalage had been burst asunder by the Christian hero. In 808,
Alfonso crossed the Duero, invaded Lusitania, and took Lisbon. Al-Hakem
hastened to the theatre of war, and obtained some successes. Abd ar-Rahman,
Al-Hakem’s son, defeated Alfonso on the banks of the Duero, took Zamora,
and compelled that king to sue for peace. However, hostilities soon recommenced,
but with little advantage to either party.</p>

<p>Internally the reign of Al-Hakem was no less troubled. Scarcely was
the rebellion of his uncles repressed, when the tyranny of Yusuf ben Amru
occasioned great disorders in Toledo. In 805, the inhabitants openly rose
against the governor, whom they confined in prison. Al-Hakem invited
the principal inhabitants&mdash;chiefly Mohammedans&mdash;to wait on the heir of the
monarchy; but as they entered the palace, they were seized by his soldiers,
were carried into a subterraneous apartment, and massacred. [More than
seven hundred are said to have perished on this “day of the fosse” (807).]
About the same time a conspiracy was formed in Cordova itself, the object
of which was to assassinate Al-Hakem, and to raise a grandson of the first
Abd ar-Rahman to the vacant throne. The fatal secret was revealed to the
monarch’s ear. The very day on which this tragedy was to be perpetrated,
three hundred gory heads were exhibited in the most public part of Cordova.
Had his own been there, instead of them, no public sorrow would have been
manifested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[815-835 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This incident was not likely to assuage his appetite for blood&mdash;an appetite
which is believed to have been innate in his temperament, though education
and circumstances had hitherto suspended its cravings. Commensurate
with its increasing intensity was his passion for luxury. He no longer
delighted in reaping “the iron harvests of the field.” Shut up in his palace
with his female slaves, amidst the sweetest sounds of vocal and instrumental
music, or witnessing the lascivious dance, he passed the whole of his time.
If, however, his person was thus hidden from the eyes of his people, his
existence was but too evident from the execution of his sanguinary mandates.
That he might enjoy the pleasures without the cares of royalty, in
the year 815 he caused his son Abd ar-Rahman to receive the homage of his
chiefs as the wali alhadi, or successor to the throne, and on the shoulders of
that prince he thenceforth laid the whole weight of government. But
tyrants often tremble, as well as their oppressed subjects. To escape assassination,
or the consequences of an open insurrection, he filled or surrounded
his palace with a chosen guard of five thousand men, whose fidelity he
secured by permanent liberal pay. To meet this extraordinary increase of
expenditure, he laid an entrance duty on the merchandise which arrived in
the capital. This measure excited indignation, not so much because it was
oppressive as because it was novel; murmurs arose on every side, and even
an open insurrection appeared certain. To crush it by terror, he ordered
ten men who had refused to pay the duty to be publicly executed.</p>

<p>A trivial accident, however, acting like a spark on the present inflammable
spirit of the people, produced a general explosion; the guards of the ten
prisoners were massacred; a few who wisely fled were pursued to the very gates
of the palace, the multitude uttering terrific menaces against the author and
advisers of so odious a novelty. The desire of vengeance roused the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
from his unworthy lethargy. Seizing his arms, and followed by the cavalry
of his guard, he charged the mob, which, as mobs always will do, endeavoured
to escape when real danger approached. In a few minutes the streets of
Cordova were strewn with dead bodies; such as could reach their habitations
were safe; about three hundred were overtaken on the banks of the river,
and were instantly impaled. But the effects did not end here; the numerous
streets outside the walls of the city were levelled with the ground, and the
surviving inhabitants were pardoned only on the condition of leaving Cordova
forever. With loud lamentations, the unhappy exiles departed from
the scene of their former happiness; a
considerable number settled in Toledo;
eight thousand accepted the asylum offered
them by Edris ben Edris in his new city
of Fez, and the quarter where they settled
is at this day called the Andalusian quarter.
The fate of the far greater portion
was more singular; fifteen thousand proceeded
to Egypt, seized on Alexandria,
and there maintained themselves in spite
of all opposition, until the wali, by the
caliph’s permission, purchased their departure
by a large sum of money, and by
allowing them to reside on one of the isles
of Greece. They chose Crete, and founded
an independent government [which lasted
till 961 when the Greeks recaptured it].
From this moment Al-Hakem, who acquired
the surname of the Cruel, was
torn by incessant remorse. In 821 he
breathed his last.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p204.jpg" width="200" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Saracen Chief</span></p>
</div>

<p>Abd ar-Rahman II had long made himself
beloved, both in a private capacity
and as the deputy of his father; happiness
was as much hoped from his reign, and as
much was it alloyed by many misfortunes.
The first was the hostile arrival of his
great uncle, Abdallah, son of Abd ar-Rahman
I, who, though on the verge of the
tomb, resolved to strike another blow for empire. He was speedily defeated.
A salutary law was now passed, defining the right of succession to be inherent
in the children of the natural monarch, according to their primogeniture;
and, where the direct heirs subsisted, excluding the other branches of the
family.</p>

<p>In his transactions with the Christians of the Asturias and Catalonia, Abd
ar-Rahman was more fortunate than his two predecessors. He did not allow
either Alfonso or Ramiro to gain much advantage over him. Three armies
of Franks successively appeared in Spain, but effected nothing; while a
Mohammedan fleet burned the suburbs of Marseilles. Nor was the kingdom
of Abd ar-Rahman free from internal troubles. Merida twice revolted;
Toledo followed the example, and sustained a blockade of nine years against
the royal forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[835-886 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Scarcely were these domestic wounds closed, when a new and unexpected
enemy appeared on the coast of Lusitania. The Scandinavian vikings, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
fifty-four vessels, had spread terror along the maritime districts of France
and the peninsula. These savage northmen landed wherever there was a
prospect of booty; plundered towns and churches; consumed with fire
everything which they could not remove; and put to the sword all, of
every age and of either sex, who had the misfortune to fall in their way.
In short, from the terrific descriptions given of them both in the Icelandic
sagas and the Christian writers of the south, we should suppose them to
have been demons rather than men. Thirteen days they assailed Lisbon,
and that place would have fallen but for the seasonable march of the neighbouring
walis to relieve it. The pirates re-embarked with their booty;
landed on the coasts of Lusitania and Algarve, which they ravaged; and
ultimately destroyed a great part of Seville. Such was their reputation for
valour, that their retreat was seldom molested. To rebuild the ruined walls
was the immediate work of the king, and to be prepared for resistance, in
the event of future piratical descents, he established a line of forts from the
principal seaports to his capital, with facilities for communicating rapidly
with one another. To add to these internal calamities, a drought of two
years withered the productions of the earth; or if anything was spared by
the heat, it was devoured by clouds of locusts.</p>

<p>These sufferings of his people must sensibly have afflicted the heart of
Abd ar-Rahman; and he endeavoured to relieve them by importing corn from
Africa, and by furnishing the unemployed with occupation. The works
which he constructed in that city were of equal magnificence and utility.
Mosques were erected; the streets paved; marble baths made for the convenience
of the men; and, the most important of all his enterprises, water
in abundance was brought from the mountains to the city by means of
leaden pipes. Abd ar-Rahman was a man of letters as well as a man of science.
In 850 he caused his son Muhammed to be acknowledged wali alhadi. In
852 he died, universally lamented by his people.</p>

<p>The reign of Muhammed I contains little to strike the attention. He
was always at war, either with the Asturians or his own subjects. Ramiro,
Ordoño, and Alfonso III successively defeated his best troops, and gradually
enlarged their dominions. He was ultimately more successful in his contests
with his subjects than with his natural enemies. Of the difficulty, however,
with which this success was obtained, Musa ben Zeyad, the wali of Saragossa,
and Omar, a bandit chief, afford us abundant proof. Omar escaped
into the Pyrenees, and offered his services to the Navarrese; gained them
many fortresses, and received from them the title of king. He conquered
the whole country as far as the Ebro. The king in person, with his son
Al-Mundhir, and his best officers, hastened to the field. Omar was defeated
and slain. But the rebels were not yet annihilated. Kalib ben Omar, who
with the title inherited the warlike spirit of his father, was destined to
greater things, and laid waste or rendered tributary the country on the
banks of the Ebro. Al-Mundhir advanced to measure arms with the son of
his old enemy; but a whole year elapsed before he could gain any advantage
over Kalib. If to these agitating scenes we add a drought of a year’s
duration, the third which had visited Spain within the short period of twenty
years; an earthquake which swallowed several towns, and another invasion
of the Normans, some idea may be formed of the disasters of this reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[886-939 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The death of Muhammed was sudden. No sooner did Kalib ben Omar
hear of Muhammed’s death than he descended from his mountains, was
joined by thousands of partisans, and was successful beyond his most sanguine
hopes. Huesca, Saragossa, and Toledo opened their gates to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
The whole kingdom was in consternation or in joy, according to the loyalty
or disaffection of the people. It is certain that the new king, Al-Mundhir,
had not many friends, and those few he soon lost. In the second year of his
reign he fell in battle with the formidable Kalib.</p>

<p>The reign of Abdallah, the brother and successor of Al-Mundhir, was destined
to be as troubled as any of his predecessors. One of the first revolts
was headed by his eldest son Muhammed. He was joined by his brother
Al-Kasim; but he was defeated by his younger brother Abd ar-Rahman, was
severely wounded in battle, and was consigned to a dungeon by the victor,
until the king’s pleasure could be known. There he died, whether in consequence
of his wounds, or by violence, is uncertain. But the greatest affliction
of the king was the continued triumph of the rebel Kalib.</p>

<p>On the death of Abdallah, the throne of Mohammedan Spain was filled by
Abd ar-Rahman III, son of the rebel prince Muhammed, who had so mysteriously
died in prison, and, therefore, grandson of Abdallah. Why the deceased
king did not procure the elevation of his own son Abd ar-Rahman, surnamed
Al-Mudafar, or the Victorious, surprised many, but grieved none. By universal
acclamation the new king was hailed as Emir al-muminin, or prince of
the believers, and An-Nasir lidini-l-lahi, defender of the faith of God. It is
difficult to account for the yielding of this spiritual homage to the young
prince; but the fact is certain that he was the first of his family to assume
the title and honours of caliph.</p>

<p>After labouring with success to pacify the partisans of the Abbasids, who
at first regarded his assumption of the spiritual character as little less than
blasphemous, Abd ar-Rahman resolved to exterminate the audacious rebels
who had so long distracted the kingdom. The son of Omar ben Hafs still
reigned at Toledo over nearly one-half of Mohammedan Spain. To contend
with this formidable adventurer, Abd ar-Rahman assembled a select military
force of forty thousand men, and took the field. In the end victory declared
for the king; seven thousand of the rebel and three thousand of the royal
forces were left on the field. The consequences of this success were important;
the whole of eastern Spain submitted to Abd ar-Rahman. Kalib himself
long held out against the power of Abd ar-Rahman.</p>

<p>The pacification of his kingdom allowed Abd ar-Rahman leisure to dream
of ambition, which opportunity seasonably aided. He came into conflict
with the ruler of Egypt, over Fez, which he finally cleared of the Egyptians.
But the most memorable of the warlike exploits of this king were against the
Christians of Leon and the Asturias. Soon after the accession of Abd ar-Rahman,
Ordoño II invaded the Mohammedan possessions, and, if any faith is
to be had in the chroniclers of his nation, he obtained many advantages&mdash;advantages,
however, of which not the slightest mention is made by the
Mohammedan writers. In short, from the accession of Ordoño to some time
after that of Ramiro II, not one of the successes derived by the Christians
is acknowledged by the Moors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[939-961 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the conflicting statements of the two hostile writers, it appears
certain that in 934 Ramiro II made an irruption into the states of Abd ar-Rahman,
and ruined Madrid, and that the king of Cordova, in revenge, sent
Almudafar to invade Galicia. That hero, say the historians of his nation,
made terrible reprisals on the subjects of Ramiro, thousands of whom he
brought away captive, with an immense booty, and defeated Ramiro himself
on the banks of the Duero. The Christians, on the other hand, tell us that
their hero triumphed over the misbelievers on the plains of Osma (which is on
the banks of that river), of whom he slew a great number, and made many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
thousands of captives. Abd ar-Rahman advanced to meet him with eighty
thousand men. The combat [of Alhandega] which ensued was the most
obstinate, and beyond comparison the most bloody, that had been fought
between Christians and Moors since the days of Roderic. There can be no
doubt that victory shone on the banners of the Christians, notwithstanding
the assertion of the Mohammedan writers, who say that Ramiro was driven
from the field. But that the success was so splendid as the Christians pretend,
that eighty thousand of the Moors fell on this memorable day, is too
monstrous to be believed. According to the Arabian writers, that number
only&mdash;yet it is surely large enough&mdash;left Zamora, twenty thousand out of
the original one hundred thousand remaining to invest that fortress. And
if their account is to be credited&mdash;and the minute circumstances attending
it give it all the air of truth&mdash;Abd ar-Rahman took the fortress on his
return to Cordova.</p>

<p>During the rest of don Ramiro’s reign one battle only is said by the
Christians to have been fought between the Moors and him, in which he was
of course victorious. But if the Mohammedans are to be believed, that hero
was defeated in 941 by Abdallah, wali of the frontier; and again in 949 by
Abd ar-Rahman in person.</p>

<p>In his internal administration Abd ar-Rahman was distinguished for great
capacity of mind, for unbounded liberality, for unrivalled magnificence, and
for inflexible justice. The foundation of the palace and town of Medina-Azhara,
about two leagues from Cordova&mdash;the former distinguished for all
the splendour of art and wealth, the latter for a mosque which rivalled that
of Cordova&mdash;attested his taste and luxury. The roof of the palace is said
to have been supported by above four thousand pillars of variegated marble,
the floors and walls to have been of the same costly material, the chief apartments
to have been adorned with exquisite fountains and baths; and the
whole to have been surrounded by the most magnificent gardens, in the midst
of which arose a pavilion resting on pillars of white marble ornamented
with gold, and commanding an extensive prospect. In the centre of the
pavilion, a fountain of quicksilver, we are told, constantly played, reflecting
in a new and wondrous manner the rays of the sun. The whole description
reminds us rather of the creations of genii than of the labours of man. Of
the justice of this great king the Mohammedan world had a fearful example
in the fate of his son Abdallah. Many years before his death he caused his
second son, Al-Hakem, to be recognised as wali alhadi. The choice gave
umbrage to Abdallah, who at length entered into a conspiracy, the object of
which seems to have been the assassination or perpetual imprisonment of Al-Hakem.
The secret was betrayed by one of the number; Abdallah was
suddenly arrested, confessed his meditated crime, and was suffocated, notwithstanding
the entreaties of his intended victim Al-Hakem. “Thy humane
request,” replied the king, “becomes thee well, and if I were a private
individual it should be granted; but as a king, I owe both to my people and
my successors an example of justice; I deeply lament the fate of my son;
I shall lament it through life; but neither thy tears nor my grief shall save
him!” The king seems ever afterwards to have blamed his excessive rigour.
Though at the very summit of human prosperity, he was thenceforth unhappy.
Accordingly, we need not be surprised to hear his own confession that
during near fifty years of empire, his days of happiness amounted to no more
than fourteen.</p>

<p>The reign of Abd ar-Rahman III has been termed the most brilliant period
in the history of the Spanish Arabs.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_7d"><a href="#parthians_endnote_7d">d</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[912-961 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Among the Omayyad princes of Spain Abd ar-Rahman III incontestably
holds the first place. His achievements bordered on the fabulous. He had
found the empire in a state of anarchy and civil war, divided amongst a
crowd of chiefs of different race, exposed to constant raids from the Christians
of the north, and on the verge of being absorbed either by Leon or by
the Fatimites. In spite of innumerable obstacles he had saved Andalusia
both from itself and from foreign rule. He had given to it internal order
and prosperity and the consideration and respect of foreigners. He found
the treasury in disorder; he left it in the most flourishing condition. A
third of the annual revenues, which amounted to 6,245,000 pieces of gold,
sufficed for the ordinary expenditure; another third was kept as a reserve;
the rest was devoted to buildings. The condition of the country was equally
prosperous. Agriculture, industry, commerce, the arts and sciences, flourished
together. The foreigner was lost in wonder at the scientific system of irrigation,
which gave fertility to lands that appeared most unpromising. He
was struck by the perfect order which, thanks to a vigilant police, reigned
in the most inaccessible districts. Commerce had developed to such an
extent that, according to the report of the superintendent of the customs, the
duties on imports and exports constituted the most considerable part of
the revenue. A superb navy enabled Abd ar-Rahman to dispute with the
Fatimites the empire of the Mediterranean, and secured him in the possession
of Ceuta, the key of Mauretania. A numerous and well-disciplined army,
perhaps the best in the world, gave him a preponderance over the Christian
of the north. The most haughty sovereigns were eager for his alliance.
Ambassadors were sent to him by the emperor of Constantinople and by the
sovereigns of Germany, Italy, and France.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_7e"><a href="#parthians_endnote_7e">e</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving for a while the Spanish Arabs, now at the height of their power,
we return to the Mohammedans in the East.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII. THE ABBASIDS</h3>

<div class="sidenote">[750-1258 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The revolution which had raised the Abbasids to the caliphate may be
regarded as an uprising of eastern against western Asia; it was the populations
of Khorasan and Irak who had brought it about, and it was they whom
it chiefly benefited. Abul Abbas, who reigned but four years (750-754)
transferred the royal residence from Syria to Babylonia and took up his
abode at Anbar. His brother and successor Al-Mansur, desiring a more
imposing dwelling-place, at first chose Cufa, but finding that popular feeling
ran high there against his own family, and in favour of the Fatimites, he
decided to build for himself a new city which should owe entire allegiance
to him.</p>

<h4>FOUNDING OF BAGHDAD (762 A.D.)</h4>

<p>Thus he founded Baghdad (762), which was destined to eclipse all
other cities of the Orient. A brick wall strengthened by about 160 towers
defended it from attack, and immense sums were spent in its embellishment.
The people of the East regarded with satisfaction this change of capital
which brought the seat of government nearer to themselves; but the inhabitants
of Spain and Maghreb, already discontented with their isolated situation
which made them in a way mere tributary provinces, were only awaiting a
favourable opportunity to declare their independence.</p>

<p>Upon learning of the downfall of the Omayyads and the ascension of the
Abbasids, Spain immediately cut herself loose from the mother-country and
proclaimed as caliph a member of the Omayyad family, who chanced to be in
Maghreb. Africa, without going so far, appeared to approve the course of
its governor, Abd ar-Rahman, who hesitated to recognise the sovereignty
of Al-Mansur; and the people, equally unwilling to acknowledge the caliphate
of Cordova, gradually broke up into distinct groups each having its own
chief, until the fragile ties which still bound them to the Abbasid dynasty
were completely severed (755-756 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>The period of the first Abbasid caliphs was also that of the greatest
splendour in the history of the oriental Arabs; it marked the passing of the
age of conquest and the dawning of the new glories of civilisation. Al-Mansur,
brother of Abul Abbas, whose reign was short, in reality opens the series
of those remarkable caliphs whose names, still popular in Arabia, have been
made equally so in other lands by <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>. He had
fought when young under the chiefs of his family and merited the name
“Victorious” which had been bestowed upon him; but his principal claim
to glory lies in having created a system of government which attests the
depth and soundness of his views. Throughout his vast empire the finance
and military forces of the provinces were under the control of the different
governors, who devoted the products of taxation to supplying the needs of
their localities and sent to the caliphs only what was left over. Not daring
to disturb a condition of things so favourable to the people, Al-Mansur instituted
the method of frequently changing the representatives of the royal
power in the provinces, and of debarring all members of distinguished
families from taking part in the transaction of public affairs. His greatest
error was an insufficient regard for the sanctity of his word, and a relentless
abasement of any servant whose rising greatness seemed to involve a menace.
Thus Abdallah, the overthrower of the Omayyads, Abu Muslim, and later the
Barmecides, all fell victims to a policy as pitiless as it was suspicious.</p>

<p>Al-Mansur devoted a portion of his life to amassing wealth which some
historians estimate to have reached a sum equivalent to £30,000,000, or
$150,000,000, but this avidity did not prevent his displaying great liberality
towards men of learning, and he himself gave the example of an enlightened
interest in the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>During his reign the people, accustomed to rendering him the profound
respect he demanded, grew to look upon the caliph as the representative of
God on earth, and his successors had no difficulty in enforcing obedience.
Nay, they were rather concerned to avoid the despotism made easy by their
unlimited authority. The first caliphs after Abul Abbas were just princes,
who exerted their power for the general and intellectual welfare of the
Arabs. Other cities arose beside Baghdad; roads were laid, caravansaries,
market-places, canals, and fountains were constructed, learned and charitable
institutions were erected, and the study of letters, commerce, and all the
arts of peace were directly fostered by the government.</p>

<h4>HARUN AR-RASHID (786-809 A.D.)</h4>

<p>The magnificence of all previous reigns paled before that of Harun ar-Rashid,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Harun the Just (786-809). This famous potentate, in whom the
peculiar genius of the Arab race seems to have reached its highest development,
merits particular mention among the vicegerents of Mohammed.
Brave, generous, and magnanimous, he resisted all temptations to use despotically
his supreme power over a people who never murmured at his will,
and governed with a sole view to assuring the happiness of his subjects. He
loved virtue, was always ready to recognise his own faults, and neglected no
occasion of doing good. That he so far belied his character as to decree the
murder of the Barmecides shows him to have been deceived by false statements
concerning that family, which had furnished him with his ablest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
statesmen, Fadl and the grand vizier Jafar. Of Persian origin, the Barmecides
had figured prominently at court for nearly a century, and it was chiefly
at the instigation of their later representatives that Harun ar-Rashid was so
active in protecting commerce, industry, and the arts. Singularly enough
Emin, Harun’s eldest son, possessed none of the virtues of his father; but his
brother, Al-Mamun, showed profound wisdom in governing the affairs of
Khorasan and by popular choice he was placed upon the throne in 813, Emin
being made to resign his authority.</p>

<h4>AL-MAMUN AND HIS SUCCESSORS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[809-847 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Al-Mamun surpassed all hopes that had been formed of him. Less brilliant
than Harun, he was superior to him in the range of his knowledge and
the practical force of his genius. The single political mistake with which he
can be reproached was an act of gratitude and kindness. In recompense for
services received, he gave to Tahir the hereditary governorship of Khorasan,
and this was the first step towards the dismemberment of the eastern caliphate;
not because the Tahirites were disposed to abuse their power, but
because an unfortunate example had been set, which led the governors of
provinces to seek gradually to cut themselves free from the control of their
rightful sovereign.</p>

<p>Holding education to be the highest blessing of the people, Al-Mamun
opened schools in all parts of his realm, and insured the pursuit of letters by
permanent endowments. He gathered about him learned men of all nationalities,
and would admit no distinctions in religion. He even decreed that
any ten heads of families, whether Christians, Jews, or magi, who assembled
for the purpose, could constitute a church, and that all were eligible to
appointment for public offices. But, liberal as he was, Al-Mamun was not
always safe from hostile attack. The theologians of Baghdad had already
been active in putting down zendism, a religion compounded of the beliefs
of Islam and the magi; and on Al-Mamun’s making use of some of the writings
of this faith to render odious the memory of Abu Muslim, they brought
violent accusations against him. To silence his adversaries Al-Mamun increased
the penalties against separatism, but true to his principles of tolerance
forbore to inflict them.</p>

<p>Al-Mamun’s immediate successors, Mutasim and Wathik, were worthy of
the throne. The first-named made the single mistake of forming his body-guard
of young Turks, whose later successors were to renew the excesses
committed by the prætorians in the time of the Roman emperors; while the
reign of Wathik was disturbed solely by doctrinal disputes. Great indeed
must have been the diversity of opinion in religious matters, since there are
to be counted no less than sixty-three principal sects among the Arabs.
Wathik having brought the light of his reason to bear on the dogma of the
eternity of the <i>Koran</i>, sustained with great heat by Akhmed ben Nasr, was at
one time on the point of being dethroned and supplanted by his rude antagonist.
Although treated with severity by prejudiced historians, Wathik
was an excellent prince, who governed his realm with such wisdom and
benevolence that it soon came to contain no beggars, and he died with the
resignation of a firm, enlightened character.</p>

<p>The reigns of the earlier Abbasids are marked by a complete absence of
expeditions undertaken with a view to aggrandisement, the wars with neighbouring
populations being carried on without any thought of invasion. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Greeks offered the Arabs of the Orient more frequent pretexts for dispute
than other nations, and the frontier line which separated them became the
scene of many sanguinary conflicts. The vanity of the degenerate Greeks
who constituted the population there, was inordinately flattered by success
even in border-warfare, and they continued their aggressions through the
reigns of most of Abul Abbas’ successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[754-833 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>During the reign of Al-Mansur the Byzantine emperors had been
afflicted by the loss of Melitene, an important city of Cappadocia, the devastation
of Cilicia, and the defeat of an army on the shores of the Melas, in
Pamphylia, and were destined to suffer further reverses at the hands of the
caliph himself. Irritated by successive defeats, the Arabs got together all
their forces and entered Asia Minor, where they vanquished all the troops
that Irene, guardian of Constantine Copronymus, sent against them, and
finally appeared before the walls of Constantinople.
Preferring capitulation to the horrors of a siege,
the empress surrendered the cities of Cilicia and
agreed to pay an annual tribute of sixty thousand
dinars. Harun ar-Rashid, whom Al-Mahdi had
placed in command of this expedition, returned
to Syria with considerable booty and with six
thousand prisoners in his train.</p>

<p>In 792 Irene believed herself strong enough
to break the treaty, and preparations for hostilities
were begun on both sides. Harun, now become
caliph, had vessels equipped which ravaged the
islands of the Mediterranean and destroyed the
Greek fleet in the Gulf of Adalia, making Irene
pay dearly for her attempt at rebellion. She again
agreed to pay tribute, stipulating merely an exchange
of captives; which exchange took place on
the bank of a little river in Cilicia, and was ever
afterward a custom when a truce occurred between
belligerents. Nicephorus, Irene’s successor, confident
in his courage, hesitated not to tempt fortune
again.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p212.jpg" width="150" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Saracen Swords</span></p>
<p class="caption">(From a panel in the Alhambra)</p>
</div>

<p>He addressed a haughty letter to the caliph,
which elicited this brief reply: “In the name
of the all-merciful God, Harun ar-Rashid, commander
of the faithful, to Nicephorus, dog of a
Roman. I have received your letter, son of an
infidel, and you shall not hear my reply, you shall
see it.” Harun indeed wrote his reply in letters of fire all over the plains
of Asia Minor. He was constantly victorious; but, though the wars in
which he was engaged proved that the Arabs had not yet lost their military
skill, they showed that they had greatly deteriorated from the standard of
the generals of Omar, who would not have paused till they reached Constantinople
itself.</p>

<p>In 829 the war was resumed under a singular pretext. Al-Mamun, who
was a passionate lover of mathematics, learned that Leon, an adept in that
science, resided at Constantinople, and made known his desire to consult
him at Baghdad. The emperor refused to allow Leon to leave Constantinople,
and Al-Mamun again took up arms, but did not push the war with
great vigour. In 833, after Mutasim had come to the throne, the emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
encouraged by some slight Greek successes, in his turn took the offensive, and
for a long time the issues were about even between the two rulers. At
last after the taking of Zapetra, the caliph’s native town (836), by the
emperor, Mutasim swore to be revenged; and marching on Amorium took
the city (840) and subjected it to the same treatment as had been inflicted
on Zapetra. Wathik, Mutasim’s successor, was less bent on war; but the
Greeks continued hostilities until, under the emperor Basil, they regained
all the domains in Cilicia that Harun had taken from them.</p>

<p>In their western provinces the Abbasids displayed no great eagerness
or concern; they scarcely sought to hold Spain under their sway, and left
Africa almost entirely to itself, even serving by their own direct acts to
elevate the family of the Aghlabites, and free it from all allegiance to themselves
except the formal recognition of sovereignty. Ibrahim ben Aghlab
thus assumed governorship over all Maghreb; but his successors were
not able to prevent a member of the Alid family from severing from the
Baghdad caliphate the whole of western Mauretania.</p>

<h4>BAGHDAD UNDER THE CALIPHS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[801-908 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Abbasids hoped, perhaps, that the divisions which could not fail to
arise in Spain would bring the peninsula again under their dominion; and
this anticipation will serve to explain their negotiations with the Frankish
kings, the embassies and presents that passed back and forth between Harun
ar-Rashid and Charlemagne. The Baghdad caliphate, meanwhile, did not
once take up arms against that of Cordova, though Arabs from the peninsula
had made incursions into their domains, and a fleet, manned by Andalusian
pirates, had taken and burned Alexandria, putting the inhabitants to the
sword. In thus abstaining from reprisals and warlike enterprises the Abbasids
yielded to the spirit of the times. The Arabs of the East were beginning
to appreciate the benefits of civilisation; and the Baghdad rulers
responded to the wishes of their subjects by giving them an orderly system
of administration, by establishing strict justice, by distributing far and wide
the advantages of education, and by cementing the union between the different
provinces of the empire by means of closer commercial and industrial
relations.</p>

<p>A chamber of finance and a state chancery had originally been instituted,
and for a time these had been deemed sufficient; but later the chamber of
finance had been replaced by four diwans, one of which was charged specially
with the payment of troops, another with the imposition of taxes, a third
with the appointment of subordinate officials, and the fourth with the keeping
of accounts. The Abbasids had added to this organisation the office of
<i>hajid</i>, a sort of chamberlain whose mission was to introduce ambassadors,
and that of a superior judge, who was to relieve them of the care of deciding
important cases that were appealed from the judgment of the kadi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[750-1258 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Upon their accession to power the Abbasids had resolved to give more
unity and force to the administration; and as the burden of affairs was
really too heavy for one man to carry, they had attached to their persons a
vizir (bearer of burdens) whose duty it was to perform all preliminary
labours, and to fix the sum each province was to pay in taxes, so that the
amount of the state revenues could be approximately estimated in advance.
In imposing taxes the caliphs were guided by a verse in the <i>Koran</i> which
ordained that every unbeliever residing in Moslem territory should be subject
to dues; the rate <i>per capita</i> for the entire population was graded according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
to the fortune of the individual, the rich paying more than the poor.
There were also certain ground-taxes and tithes, in the assessment of which
great opportunities for extortion were open to provincial governors, and the
need that the whole should be under the oversight of some vigilant head
became plainly apparent.</p>

<p>The flourishing state of finances under their rule enabled the Abbasids
to undertake many and important works. Al-Mahdi built caravansaries and
had cisterns dug along the weary road from Baghdad to Mecca, cut a new
route from Mecca to Medina, and established posting stations between Hedjaz
and Yemen that communication might be easy between the two important
provinces. From a period as early as that of Moawiyah, a courier service
had existed between the various Arab capitals.</p>

<p>The Abbasids also permanently endowed a number of mosques and
schools, which were thus enabled to subsist through all political revolutions.
They collected the archives of the caliphate in Baghdad, and organised in
that city an excellent police, which not only protected individuals but
watched over property night and day. The merchants themselves were
formed into syndicate bodies with the charge of guarding against commercial
frauds, and a supervisor of market-places was appointed to verify the
weights and measures used, and his soldiers dealt summary justice to all
found guilty of trickery. In the desert districts, too, pillage and depredation
had been again begun by the Bedouins, now that warlike expeditions
had ceased, and <i>miraje</i> were appointed whose special office it was to protect
pilgrims and caravans on their way to Mecca.</p>

<p>In this manner the Abbasid caliphs strove to insure the prosperity of
their realm, and under them the Arabs rose to a high degree of civilisation.
With the same ardour that had characterised them in their military undertakings,
they now endeavoured to outstrip the Greeks in commerce, industry,
and the arts, excelling in those very branches of letters and sciences in
which the inhabitants of Constantinople, even in that city’s decadence,
believed themselves to be supreme.</p>

<p>Agriculture was widely practised; by a skilful system of cultivation the
merit and reputation of the fruits and flowers of Persia were greatly
enhanced, and the wines of Shiraz, Yed, and Ispahan became staples of commerce
throughout Asia. Mines of iron, lead, and other minerals were
carefully exploited, beautiful fabrics were manufactured in the cities of Irak
and Syria, and remarkable progress was made in every branch of mechanical
art. The sciences, letters, and decorative art were actively cultivated, as
were architecture and music; while, though a check was placed upon sculpture
and painting in their highest form by the <i>Koran</i>, which forbade the
reproduction of the human figure or that of the Godhead, a number of
magnificent monuments were erected in the cities of Mesopotamia and
Mawarannahar. The passion for letters displayed by Europeans during the
Renaissance scarcely equalled that of the Arabs at this period. The best
Greek writings brought from Constantinople were immediately translated,
a school of interpreters was opened at Baghdad, and fifteen thousand dinars
were devoted yearly to educational institutions. Libraries were founded,
and enlarged from century to century by the ruling princes, and the Arab
tongue became the universal language of Asia, gradually supplanting the
more ancient idioms. There were hospitals, wherein physicians were
obliged to submit to several examinations before being allowed to practise
their profession, and laboratories for experiment with medicinal plants, of
which several had been recently discovered. The Arabs were, in fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
creators of modern chemistry, and though they erred in leaning too much
toward alchemy and astrology, their very errors indirectly contributed to
the progress of the science.</p>

<p>Great as was the contrast between the literary culture of the Arabs and
the profound ignorance of Europe during the Middle Ages, the luxury and
magnificence displayed by the Abbasid dynasty forms a no less curious
spectacle. Sole depositaries of the natural wealth of many and vast provinces,
and without a permanent army to support, they disposed freely of
enormous revenues, which were expended in a truly fabulous manner. Gold
and precious stones were fairly strewn through palaces, mosques, and
gardens, and the gifts lavished on friends and favourites reached a stupendous
amount. It is said that Al-Mahdi expended six millions of dinars
during a single pilgrimage to Mecca, and that Zobaida, the wife of Harun,
made use of no utensils save golden ones set with gems, and wore no stuffs
save those woven with silver threads. In Al-Mamun’s palace were sixty
thousand rugs and pieces of tapestry, many of which were embroidered in
gold; and on the occasion of the reception of a Greek ambassador, he
caused to be erected in the audience chamber a tree of solid gold bearing
pearls to represent fruit. Mutasim’s stables in Samara were said to contain
accommodation for a hundred thousand horses; and when he founded that
city, he had the entire site artificially constructed without regard to the cost
of so gigantic an undertaking.</p>

<h4>GRADUAL DECLINE OF ARABIAN DOMINION IN THE EAST</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[786-892 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Charlemagne, having heard much of the power of the Baghdad sovereigns,
determined to enter into relations with them, and despatched one Jewish
deputy and two Franks to Irak with presents for the commander of the
faithful. Harun, who feared an alliance between the Frankish king and
the Omayyads of Spain, responded with alacrity to this advance, and sent
ambassadors with splendid presents to Charlemagne in return. Not only in
Europe, but in China and among the Hindus and the Tatars, the Arab potentates
were looked upon as the richest princes in the world, and exaggerated
ideas prevailed as to their power.</p>

<p>Indeed at a casual glance it might seem that centralisation had drawn
into unity all their various provinces, and that a long and prosperous future
lay before the nation; but to an observant eye the signs of approaching decadence
were already apparent. In the material order of things, that a
sovereign should have supreme rights over the property of his subjects
necessarily destroys all impulse towards emulation and progress among the
latter. A people so governed is bound to die out in discouragement and
decay. Under the earlier caliphs no injustice or spoliation was to be feared;
but when the brutal and astute Turks took the reins of power, the law of
the <i>Koran</i>, by which supreme authority centred in one individual, the representative
of God on earth, was certain to work irreparable harm. In the
moral and religious order the same unfortunate conditions prevailed. Gifted
minds, irresistibly drawn towards science while still bound by the letter of
Mohammed’s books, had need of a deliverer who should free them from the
yoke of principles too rigid for the times. Al-Mamun, and after him Mutasim
and Wathik, attempted some modification of doctrines formed for primitive
times, but their efforts were set at naught by the blind obstinacy of the
doctors of the Moslem faith. The <i>Koran</i> now being established as the direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
word of God, its laws were held to be beyond appeal, and all the prerogatives
of absolute despotism were still accorded to monarchy even against
the judgment of those in whom it was vested. If the later Abbasid princes
had been men of high attainments and solid virtue, they would doubtless
have wielded their unrestricted power entirely for the good of the people,
and the golden age might again have been ushered in; but unfortunately
during the second half of the ninth century we see on the throne only
crowned and sceptred slaves. The contempt they inspired broke the
springs of government; anarchy reached its height, and numerous factions,
long suppressed, took up arms once more and spread abroad disorder and
dread.</p>

<p>The Alids had several times renewed their pretensions to the throne.
Once Al-Mamun was on the point of abdicating in their favour, thus recognising
the justice of their claims; but a revolt was immediately raised in
Baghdad by the house of Abbas and its partisans, which forced Al-Mamun to
relinquish the idea of dispossessing his whole family. Though their ambition
was not yet fulfilled, the Alids were emboldened by the caliph’s attitude
toward them, and henceforth lost no chance of profiting by the divisions that
necessarily arose in a state possessing no definite law of succession.</p>

<p>Under Harun and Al-Mamun the Arabian empire in the East attained
its greatest degree of splendour; we shall now observe its gradual
dissolution.</p>

<p>From the reign of Wathik (846) onwards, we see the caliphate becoming
the sport and prey of anarchy, and Baghdad fell under the yoke of a series of
cruel or implacable despots. Mutawakkil, whose reign ushered in the new
order of things, was guilty of atrocities that surpass those of Nero. He took
vengeance on a vizir who had offended him by causing him to be thrown
into a furnace lined with points of steel; and fearing that a plot was being
formed against him, he invited to a festival all the important officers of
his court and had them massacred by his soldiery. The horror which his
cruelties inspired armed against him the hand of his own son, Muntasir, who
himself died of sorrow and remorse within a year of his accession to the
throne (862).</p>

<p>Mustain, grandson of Mutasim, was chosen to succeed him, to the exclusion
of four brothers, two of whom, Mutazz and Mutamid, subsequently came
to the throne. Mustain reigned little longer than three years, and was
replaced by Mutazz, whom a faction raised to the caliphate in 866. A
second faction deposed him in 869 and a son of Wathik, Muhtadi Billah by
name, was proclaimed caliph. This prince’s projects of reform aroused
hatred in many quarters, and he was murdered in his own palace. After
him Mutamid enjoyed the exceptionally long reign of twenty-two years
(870-892), thanks to the ability and devotion of his brother, Muwaffak, who
frustrated all attempts at revolt. Most of the perpetual disorders from
which the country suffered were caused by the Turks whom Mutasim had
raised to the position of body-guard. In permanent garrison at Baghdad, and
in close proximity to the person of the sovereign, these slaves had from the
first been guilty of such excesses that Mutasim was obliged to leave the capital
and retire to the little village of Samara. Their number and influence
had constantly increased during the reign of Wathik, and at the time of his
death they had become such a power in the state that they had no difficulty
in placing Mutawakkil on the throne.</p>

<p>The danger that can arise from the establishment of alien bodies, organised
to be the instrument of the will of a sovereign who is himself the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
victim, is plainly apparent. With interests distinct from those of the
native Arabs, and subject to no control save that of the caliph himself,
these unruly Turks made brute force the agent by which they obtained their
desires. They became accomplices of the parricide Muntasir out of revenge
for some slight suffered at his father’s hands, and forced him to exclude his
brothers and appoint Mustain to the throne. A delay in the distribution
of their pay was sufficient to excite a revolt, and oblige the caliph to sign
his abdication. Muhtadi met with a still sorrier fate for having desired to
subject his redoubtable body-guard to some sort of discipline; and Muwaffak’s
only means of diverting them from
dangerous enterprises at home was to employ
them on distant missions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[819-879 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The troubles which surrounded the caliphate
in Baghdad wrought the most serious
consequences throughout the empire. The
governors of provinces, sole depositaries
of power during the intervals of government,
aspired to complete independence
and sold their submission to each successive
sovereign. The provinces themselves,
regretting the riches that went from them
to swell the disorders of the capital, encouraged
the pretensions of their governors,
until these latter finally succeeded in reducing
the caliph to a purely nominal
supremacy.</p>

<p>The dismemberment of Spain and Africa
had been the first blow struck at the
unity of the Moslem states; when the Abbasid
caliphs had invested the Aghlabites with
the government, they had not regarded it
as an act of final abdication on their own
part. In Asia the work of disintegration
had gone on more slowly. The Tahirites,
whom Al-Mamun had established in Khorasan
by giving full control of that province
to his general Tahir, maintained amicable
relations with the caliphs until their realm
in turn became torn by dissensions, and
they were finally overthrown by the power
of the Saffarids. Yakub, the leader of this
family of Saffarids, wished to push his victories further, and advanced to the
attack of Baghdad (874). Muwaffak, who was in command of the city, met
and defeated him at Wasit, but did not feel sufficiently strong to follow up
his advantage by pursuit. Yakub retired to his own dominions, and having
by the following year regained all his losses, would shortly have visited
the caliph with complete destruction, had not his life been suddenly cut
short (879).</p>

<div class="sidenote">[819-913 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The establishment of the dynasty of the Saffarids in Khorasan, Sistan,
and Tabaristan cut off all communication between the centre of the empire,
Khwarizm, and the Mawarannahar, and Ismail, the governor of those provinces,
declared his independence in full assurance of impunity. In 819 the sons of
Asad ben Saman had obtained from Al-Mamun the command of Samarcand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Ferghana, and Balkh respectively; one of them, Akhmed, transmitted his
power to his eldest son Nasr, who, by taking possession of Bokhara, became
later sovereign over all Transoxiana. Suspecting his brother Ismail of complicity
with the Turks and Saffarids, against whom he was obliged vigorously
to defend his province, Nasr pursued him with an armed force (888), but was
himself taken prisoner. On this occasion, Ismail revealed the magnanimity
of his character; he caused all the deference due his rank to be paid to his
brother, and up to the time of the latter’s death in 892 saw that his authority
was respected. When he was at last free to act as sovereign, Ismail forced
the Turks to retreat beyond the Jaxartes, and laid a solid foundation for the
Samanid dynasty.</p>

<p>Other principalities were springing into power in the remaining parts of
western Asia. The city of Bassora was seized by an adventurer who successfully
resisted all attacks during the reigns of Mutazz and Mutamid, and
nearly the whole of Arabian Irak was under the dominion of the Zengians.
To Muwaffak is due the glory of retaking these provinces&mdash;and Bassora
likewise in 882. He was not so successful in his enterprise against the
Tulunids, who detached Egypt and Syria from the Arabian empire.
Akhmed ben Tulun, one of the Turks educated at the court of the caliph,
had distinguished himself by ability and courage, and was considered
worthy of the post of governor of Egypt and Syria. Once established in
these provinces he had no difficulty in maintaining his authority, supported
as he was by the whole force of the Turkish militia; and he resolved to
declare himself independent. In 877 he claimed the right of collecting
taxes, thus openly cutting himself off from the caliphs, who, knowing their
own weakness, incited the emirs of Syria to revolt against the Tulunids.
Akhmed overcame all these difficulties, and when he died, in 884, left behind
him a consolidated power. His son Khumaraweih succeeded him, and quelled
the opposition of the few hostile parties that remained.</p>

<p>The rule of the Tulunids was on the whole advantageous to Egypt and
Syria. Akhmed loved science and was withal liberal-minded, generous, and
charitable. At Fostat, the capital of Egypt, he caused a superb mosque to be
erected, which is known to-day as the mosque of Tulun, and also built palaces
and laid out market-places for the accommodation of the traders of different
nations who flocked to Egypt at that time. Khumaraweih was distinguished
for his luxury and magnificence; he was said to have built an immense
menagerie, in which the animals were lodged in splendid cages, having
water brought to them in bronze canals. The bed in which he slept was
said to be gently rocked and supported by a tiny lake of quicksilver, on
which it rested. His death was by assassination, and with him perished the
splendour of the Tulunids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[908-946 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>No new dismemberments occurring during the reigns of Mutadid (892-902),
Muktafi (902-908), and the first part of the reign of Muktadir (908-913),
it might have been thought that the caliphs would retain the extensive
empire that remained to them. Indeed, many circumstances arose which
materially increased their power. Shortly after his accession to the throne
Mutadid received tribute from Khumaraweih, and subsequently repulsed the
tribes of Arabs and Kurds who had swarmed out of the Syrian deserts with
the intention of overpowering Mosul. Muktafi was even more successful;
he attacked Harun by sea and land and immediately received the submission
of all the emirs. In Egypt the descendants of Tulun were deserted by the very
supporters whom they had formerly laden with benefits. About this time the
Saffarids likewise disappeared, overthrown by the Samanids, against whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
they had been pitted by the artful policy of the caliphs. In addition to
their newly-gained province of Khorasan the Samanids were given the investiture
of Tabaristan and Sidjistan, Muktafi thus replacing two rival princes
in his immediate neighbourhood by a single ruler whom the Turks did not
allow to become dangerous. Muktafi’s successor, Muktadir Billah (908-932),
did not succeed, as Muktafi had done, in keeping his dominions intact.
Powerless in his own capital, he was little respected outside, and on all sides
arose disturbances that his predecessors had temporarily kept down. After
Muktadir, Kahir (932-934), Radhi (934-940), Muttaki (940-944), and Mustakfi
(944-946) lost their few remaining provinces, and the temporal power
of the caliphs in Baghdad was forever at an end.</p>

<p>In 930 a descendant of the emir, Hamdan, who had asserted his independence,
took several strongholds in the province of Jezira, and pushing
on as far as the northwest of Syria, founded there an important principality
of which the capital was Mosul. The establishment of the Hamdanites in
Jezira facilitated the rebellion of Egypt. Since the fall of the Tulunids
the caliphs had committed the blunder of allowing Egypt and Syria to remain
united, thinking that a frequent change of governors was all that was necessary
to maintain peace. But one of these governors, Ikhshid the Turk, won
over a large party of supporters, and when the order came for him to relinquish
his rule to another, he refused to obey. Thus Egypt and Syria were
finally lost to the Abbasids in 936.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Baghdad the Raikites and the Baridians disputed
the possession of Bassora, Wasit, and the province of Ahwaz, and sought to
play an important part in the politics of the capital. The lords of Armenia
and Georgia ceased to pay a tribute that was no longer demanded, and the
two provinces commenced at that epoch to separate into distinct realms. In
the provinces bordering on the Caspian Sea the same tendency was to be
observed. During the reign of Muktadir a chief named Merdawij had
conquered the province of Gilhan, wrested Tabaristan away from the Samanids,
and subdued the greater part of Aderbaijan. The glory of founding a
new dynasty, however, fell not to him but to three brothers who fought in his
army and who claimed descent from the old Sassanid kings, although their
father, Buya, was only a simple fisherman. Struck by their courage and
ability, the people flocked to their standard, and to the provinces already
gained by Merdawij they added Kerman, Mekran, Laristan, and many
others (933-940).</p>

<p>Baghdad being now surrounded by independent principalities, the dominion
of the caliphs was limited to that city itself, and even in that small realm
their authority was purely nominal. Owing to court intrigues and the rebellions
that were constantly breaking out in the city, the history of the later
Abbasids is nothing but a panorama of executions of generals, vizirs, sovereigns,
and pretenders. Out of fifty-nine commanders of the faithful thirty-eight
came to violent ends, and suffered calamities worse than death. That
the blood of the family of Mohammed might not be shed, many were made
to die of starvation; others were walled up or cast into glaciers. Kahir
emerged from his imprisonment with blinded eyes, and for the rest of his life
begged alms at the doors of mosques. His successor, Radhi, to escape the
tyranny of the Turks who were now in charge of every branch of the government,
created the post of emir of the emirs. This dignitary, to whom
was given command over the army and control over the public finances, soon
came to be the real sovereign, Radhi, who withdrew to strict seclusion, reserving
not a vestige of authority to himself. But instead of setting, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
thought, a master over the turbulent Turkish guard, Radhi’s act had simply
augmented the power of its chiefs. One of these, Bajkam, irritated at the rise
of Ibn Raik, got possession of the person of Radhi and forced him to appoint
him, Bajkam, emir of the emirs. The death of this ambitious politician in
the second year of Muttaki’s reign was the signal for fresh disturbances.
Claimants, whose pretensions the Turks were obliged to combat, sprang up
on every side, and the post of emir of the emirs came to be as hotly contested
as that of caliph had formerly been. Muttaki, having no alternative but to
sanction the acts of the stronger side, thought for a moment of placing himself
in the hands of the Ikhshidites; but Turun ordered him to be put to
death and proclaimed Mustakfi caliph. Exasperated by this terrible abuse
of power, the inhabitants of Baghdad called to their aid the Buyid princes,
who had recently established themselves in the provinces of the former Persian
Empire, and in 945 the Turks were finally driven from the city. Muiz
ad-Daula set upon the throne a caliph who was a mere tool to his desires, and
reserving the post of emir of the emirs for himself, became the first of that
series of Buyid emirs which continued for more than a century.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in singular contrast with the sanguinary turbulence of those
who had usurped their power, the Arabs, weary of wars and civil strife, gave
themselves up to the study of science and letters; the last of the Abbasids,
in the closest seclusion their palaces would afford, sought consolation for
the hardships of their lot in the society of scholars and literary men. The
Buyid princes also followed the example set by Al-Mamun, and gave a great
impetus to the study of astronomy and mathematics. They levied in their
tributary provinces forces sufficient to enable them to maintain their
supremacy against all rival factions, while the caliphs Muti, Tai, Kadir, and
Kaim, deprived of their revenues and shorn of all authority and kingly
state, played exactly the same part as was enacted by the Merovingian <i>rois
fainéants</i> under the tutelage of their mayors of the palace. Nevertheless,
it was only from the hands of the caliphs that the greater part of the ruling
families of Asia would receive their investitures, the Abbasids being still
the legitimate sovereigns in the eyes of devout Moslems.</p>

<h4>THE VARIOUS RELIGIOUS SECTS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[750-945 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In all times the Moslem empire had been disturbed by a variety of
religious sects. Under the Abbasids the Mutazilites had promulgated a
lofty faith which had exerted great influence over noble minds. There were
others which had confined themselves to protesting against the license of the
times and demanding social reformation, while many had been made merely
the instrument of personal ambition. Among the most prominent were the
Rawandis, a fanatical sect who believed that to caliphs should be accorded
the worship due to divinities, and who so importuned Al-Mansur with
their adoration that he caused them to be cut to pieces by his guards.
More formidable were the Zendians, who boldly maintained that the holding
of property was a crime, and that man should not eat the flesh of animals.
They were mercilessly pursued and exterminated. In 781 Mokanna incited
the population of Khorasan to revolt, and in 834 Babik founded in Aderbaijan
the sect of the Ismailians, who professed, according to Arab historians,
the most pronounced materialism, and for four years resisted all
Mutasim’s efforts to put them down. Of all the sects, however, none
promulgated its beliefs with such rapidity and success as that of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Karmathians, who, in the tenth century, infested Arabia and wrested from
the caliphs their spiritual and temporal power over the whole eastern part
of the peninsula.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p221.jpg" width="150" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Arab Cavalier</span></p>
<p class="caption">(Based on decorations in the Alhambra)</p>
</div>

<p>Karmat retained most of the doctrines of the <i>Koran</i>, recognising Ali and
the seven imams as direct descendants of Mohammed, and rejecting only the
theory of revelation. He had devised a system of successive degrees into
which his followers were to be initiated, and
the last of these, according to Nowairi and
Makrizi, was atheism. It is not likely that a
belief of this nature would have found many
adherents had not Karmat preached at the
same time abolition of slavery. Fighting in
the name of liberty, his partisans overcame
all opponents; but having enriched themselves
by pillage they fell into the most grievous
excesses and incurred general contumely.
The series of their victories commenced under
the reign of Mutadid, when after defeating one
of his generals they advanced on Cufa, and
reduced and pillaged it. During the reign of
Muktafi they carried their arms as far as Palestine,
and even threatened Damascus. Their
ablest chief, Abu Tahir, conducted them on
another expedition against Cufa, as a result
of which the city was totally destroyed; then
drawing near to Baghdad he repulsed the attack
of an army of thirty thousand men.
“Are your master’s soldiers as devoted as
mine?” asked Abu Tahir of one of the Moslem
generals. He then commanded one of his
men to plunge a sword into his own breast,
another to leap into the Tigris, and a third to
precipitate himself from the top of a high
cliff; all of which commands were immediately
obeyed. Some years previously (930)
the Karmathians had besieged Mecca and massacred
two thousand persons; they also destroyed
the temple of the Kaaba, carried off
the famous Black Stone, and choked up the well of Zemzem. In the Hamdanites
and Ikhshidites they finally met adversaries who were their match;
and after suffering defeat in several encounters they retired permanently
to the deserts of Syria and Bahrain.</p>

<p>In addition to the powerful reformers who aimed at nothing less than
the destruction of both the temporal and spiritual authority of the caliphs,
there were numerous philosophers and ascetics who created schisms in the
very heart of Islam. The most important of these minor sects was that of
the Sufis, whose aim was to hold the soul in constant communication with
God by destroying all natural sentiment and affection. Though frequently
persecuted by the caliphs, the apostles of Sufism succeeded in spreading their
doctrines through all Persia, thus hastening the extinction of Islam, which
was every day losing more ground. The existence of the Shiites and the
Sunnites was a further check on the growth of the Moslem faith; and the
first Abbasids having failed to establish religious unity, the troubles resulting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
from such a confusion of creeds were constantly on the increase. Born
enemies of the Omayyads though they were, the Abbasids, fearing to let the
Alids or Shiites gain too much power, were avowedly on the side of the
Sunnites and persecuted all who opposed their views.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[900-1020 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After many vain attempts to gain the throne the Alids sought to found
a dominion for themselves in some of the dismembered provinces. One of
their number was for a short time ruler of Tabaristan, but was unable to
maintain his supremacy. In Africa they were more fortunate, the Edrisites
succeeding in establishing themselves in Mauretania, while in 908 Obaid
Allah, who assumed the title of imam, rallied the whole Maghreb to his cause
and overthrew the dynasty of the Aghlabites. Gradually extending his
dominion further along the coast, he laid the foundations of the Fatimite
rule in Kairwan and Mahdiya, and was already stretching out his hand
toward Egypt when death cut short his plans. His immediate successors,
Abul-Kasim (936-945) and Al-Mansur (945-953), were unable to shake the
position of the adroit and valiant Ikhshid; but they placed themselves in
communication with the Arabian Shiites in Hedjaz and Yemen, and gained
many friends by means of largess wisely distributed. At Ikhshid’s death
disputes arose as to the succession, and Muiz-lidinillah, who replaced Al-Mansur
(953), penetrated into the interior of the country, received the submission
of the emirs, and became the first Fatimite caliph in Egypt. From
this period the Fatimites had the advantage in the spiritual struggle with
the Abbasids. After founding Great Cairo (972) they conquered Syria and
a part of Jezira, and their supremacy was acknowledged by nearly all the
populations of Arabia, who hoped to find in them a defence against the Karmathians
in future.</p>

<p>Thus three realms, which were governed respectively by the Fatimites,
the Buyids, and the Samanids, formed the whole of the Arabian empire
at the close of the tenth century; and the history of that period is most
interesting, since it shows how centres of civilisation may shift; not at
Baghdad but at Cairo were Arabian luxury and culture henceforth to shine
with their brightest lustre.</p>

<p>Under the Fatimites commerce, industry, agriculture, the arts and sciences
flourished in Egypt as they had flourished in Asia under the early Abbasids.
Magnificent works were constructed to connect the little town of Fostat with
Mesra, and splendid mosques were added to those erected by Tulun. It
seemed to be the wish of the caliphs to efface from every mind the remembrance
of the glories of Baghdad; and they were also most zealous in
administering the government of their realm, giving their personal attention
to the assessment and collection of taxes. Thanks to the remarkable fertility
of the land, they were soon in receipt of a revenue nearly as large as those
of Harun ar-Rashid. Muiz and Aziz were wise and moderate in their expenditures
and just in their rule; but Hakim who succeeded them (996-1020)
was like an evil genius on the throne. He reduced his subjects to a state
of the most abject submission, and maintained a wonderfully organised
system of police which kept him informed of the slightest occurrences, thus
giving rise to the belief that he was omniscient. He was in fact worshipped
as a divinity, and his sudden disappearance but confirmed the universal faith,
inasmuch as it was publicly stated that he had ascended to heaven whence
he would again descend to earth at a later day. One or two facts will
serve to give an idea of the blind despotism of Hakim. He set fire to Cairo
that he might enjoy the sight of the city in flames, and he tortured Jews and
Christians to make them renounce their religion, then gave them permission to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
return to it again. Terror reigned wherever he appeared; yet he respected
and encouraged learned men and caused the astronomical tables of Ibn Junis
to be dedicated to him. He is supposed to have been assassinated by one
of his sisters, who then assumed the regency in the name of his son Dhahir,
who was still a child (1020-1036). On the death of Dhahir, Abu Temim
Mustansir ascended the throne and held it for fifty-eight years. Being
acknowledged ruler of Africa and Arabia and proclaimed their spiritual
sovereign by the inhabitants of Baghdad, who were weary of the rule of
Kaim-biamrillah, Mustansir was at one time on the point of re-establishing
the universal caliphate; but he was shortly afterward punished for his
ambitious schemes by the loss of the best part of Syria, and it was with
difficulty that he could maintain his supremacy even in Palestine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[933-1094 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Buyids, who had taken possession of Persia in 933, and were all-powerful
in Irak-Arabia and Baghdad, did not continue to shine for so long
a period as the Fatimites, but their era was ushered in a little earlier. During
the last half of the tenth century, after the Turkish militia had been
destroyed and the Hamdamites driven from Jezira and Mosul, the Buyids
were without rivals in Asia, and the continuance of peace permitted them
to carry on the work begun by Al-Mamun. Two of their princes, Adhud
ad-Daula and Sharaf ad-Daula, revived the taste for literature by themselves
becoming authors, and to them is due the credit of restoring upon a sound
basis the school of Baghdad, which during their reign was to produce so
many learned men. Adhud ad-Daula did not rest content with showering
benefits on poets and scholars; he caused engineers of the highest merit to
sink the bed of the river Bendemir in Persia, thus preventing the inundations
which were so frequent and disastrous near Shiraz, and furnishing an
improved water-way for commerce. A magnificent hospital was erected at
Baghdad, and at its inauguration a festival was given which is still famous
in the annals of the East. Unfortunately the Buyids succeeded no better
than the caliphs in transmitting their power to their descendants by means
of fixed laws; they actually paved the way for the dismemberment of the
empire they had founded, and laid it open to revolution and disaster by the
impolitic manner in which they distributed its provinces and dependencies
among their children.</p>

<p>The dominion of the Samanids, after lasting for more than a century,
came to an end at about the same time. Alp Tegin, a Turkish slave who
had risen to a position of dignity under Abdul-Malik, failed in his attempt
to get the reins of power into his own hands at the death of that monarch,
and fled to Ghazni, where he gradually assumed control of public affairs,
and for sixteen years successfully resisted all efforts of the Samanids to
overthrow him.</p>

<p>Subuktigin, the wise general and councillor who succeeded him in 995,
carried the Moslem faith and arms into India, ravaging the Punjab, founding
the cities of Bast and Kasdar and defending the Samanids against the
Turks who were invading the Mawarannahar. He designated his youngest
son, Ismail, to succeed him; but the eldest, Mahmud, at the head of
an armed force, proclaimed himself an independent sovereign and became
rich with the plunder of India. He defeated the Samanids without difficulty
and became master of Khorasan in 1000, thus extending as far as the
Caspian Sea an empire that began at the Indus and Ganges and embraced
the territories known to-day as Afghanistan, Herat, and Baluchistan. Mahmud
was the first of the oriental princes to assume the title of sultan. Ghazni
was his capital, hence the name “Ghaznevid” given him by historians, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
the cities of Kanaiy, Lahore, and Delhi in India, where the greatest renown
was gained, paid him tribute. He further devastated the kingdom of Guzerat
and destroyed the pagoda of Somnath, the magnificence of which defies description.
Two thousand Brahmans were employed in the service of this temple,
and its idol was formed of a single stone fifty cubits high. Immense sums
were offered to Mahmud as a ransom for this idol, which was the most revered
in Hindustan, but he inexorably refused them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[852-1055 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>While Mahmud’s troops were swarming over India, Mawarannahar fell
into the power of the tribes of Turkestan. The sultan committed the error
of allowing these enemies to remain, and himself introduced into his dominions
the Seljuk Turks, who had recently been converted to Islam, and demanded
grants of land in Khorasan. Masud, who succeeded his father in
1028, tried to rid himself of these formidable neighbours, but was defeated
and could do no more thereafter than remain on the defensive. Toghril
Beg, grandson of Seljuk, soon gained a second victory more decisive than
the first over the Ghaznevids and drove them back towards India. Turning
westward he invaded Khawarizm, Jorjan, Irak-Djeni, and then invaded
the dominions of the Buyid princes.</p>

<p>The greatest disorder reigned at Baghdad. To escape the troubles by
which he was beset, the caliph Kaim had placed himself under the protection
of Toghril Beg, and relinquished the temporal power over all the states
of Islam to that prince, who had made great display of piety by erecting
temples to Mohammed in all the conquered cities. The ceremony of the
investiture took place in Baghdad. After kissing the dust before the caliph,
who was clothed in the black garments of the Abbasids, Toghril Beg
ascended the throne that had been especially prepared for him and received
upon his head the two crowns which signified his sovereignty over
the double realm of Persia and Arabia. To further cement this union of
the East with the West, the sister of Toghril Beg was given to the caliph in
marriage, and the title of sultan was introduced in the <i>khotba</i>, or official
prayer.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Turks withdrawn, however, than a general uprising
took place at Baghdad, and Abu Temim Mustansir, the Fatimite ruler of
Egypt, was proclaimed caliph in place of Kaim. True to his conciliatory
policy the sultan came to the rescue of the imprisoned Abbasid prince and
replaced him on the throne.</p>

<p>While the Arab predominance was being destroyed little by little, the
Greeks were making renewed efforts to regain some of the colonies they had
lost. As early as 852 their fleets had carried destruction to the town of
Damietta, and a century later they had penetrated as far as Aleppo and had
pillaged the treasures of Saif ad-Daula, the Hamdanite prince. Two of
their emperors, Nicephorus and Zimisces (963-976), had crossed the Euphrates
and made Jezireh swarm with their troops, while a great many strongholds
had been reconquered as well as the country Cilicia and the island of
Cyprus.</p>

<p>Incapable as they were of resisting the incursions of the Greeks, how were
the Baghdad caliphs to check the advance of the warrior hordes of Turkestan,
whom the Seljuks had gathered under their banner by the promise of
spoils to be gained in the lands they were to conquer? The scattered tribes
which the Samanids had easily repulsed in 893 were now united under one
chief and formed a mighty force that, sweeping down all obstacles, was to
subjugate the whole of western Asia and maintain its supremacy there for
centuries to come.</p>

<h4>THE SELJUK TURKS</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Turkish Priest</span></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">[1055-1092 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The name of Seljuks, applied to the Turks who shared in the conquests
of Toghril Beg, must not deceive as to their number; no particular horde
was meant by those thus designated, since in the Turkestan as in the Arabian
deserts any tribe which
succeeded in imposing its sovereignty
upon others gave to
these the name of its chief.
The Turks were of the Scythian
race, to which also belonged
those ferocious Huns, presented
to us under so terrifying an aspect
by Greek historians; but
a distinction must be made, inasmuch
as at the extremity of
Asia the Tatars and Mongols
lived still in a state of primitive
savagery, acknowledging
no god but a sword stuck upright
in the ground; while the
tribes called Turks had learned
agriculture and commerce from
the Arabs, and were possessed
moreover of an overweening
vanity and love of power,
which made them willing even
to be slaves that they might
gradually work upon the spirit
of their master for his final
overthrow and destruction.
Moslems themselves and Sunnites,
the Seljuks found everywhere
brothers in the enemies’
ranks, and took their investiture
from the hands of the
Abbasids. After they had
vanquished the Greeks, from
whom they wrested Asia Minor,
they extended their dominion
from the Indus to the
Bosporus. But they had no
idea of a strong organisation;
their independent chieftains, at
rivalry among themselves, disputed
with each other the fragments
of sovereign power, and
these divisions made them fall an easy prey to the Mongols, when, in the
beginning of the thirteenth century, Jenghiz Khan swept into the western
world.</p>

<p>The most brilliant epoch in the history of the Seljuks was the period
between 1055 and 1092, when they were united under one single head, and
that head was the dispenser of booty. Numerous were the gifts which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
was in the power of Toghril Beg to bestow on relatives and followers.
Recognised as sultan or supreme ruler by the caliphs, he extended his
sovereignty over Jezireh and Armenia, and it was in the midst of further
exploits that death surprised him in 1063. His nephew, Alp Arslan, succeeded
him and enjoyed a brilliant reign. He vanquished the Roman
emperor, Diogenes, destroyed the independence of the Georgians, and had
just carried his arms into Turkestan, when he died by the hand of a citizen
of Khwarizm. The greater part of Asia had come under his sway, twelve
hundred chiefs paid homage to him, and two hundred thousand soldiers
marched under his banner; and yet he was not the most brilliant among
the princes of his family; that glory was reserved for his son, Malik Shah
(1072-1092).</p>

<p>Malik Shah was a ruler endowed with the highest qualities, and his noble
projects were ably seconded by his grand vizier, Nizam al-Mulk. Mosques
and colleges were erected at Baghdad, and new roads and canals facilitated
communication between the most distant points of the empire. While
Nizam al-Mulk occupied himself with the details of the administration, the
sultan travelled from one of his states to another seeking to make their
boundaries recede ever further and further. His name was uttered in prayers
from Mecca to Baghdad, from Ispahan to Kashgar; and he ultimately became
master of all Asia Minor. By his orders Suleiman, one of his kinsmen,
entered the territory of the Greeks and advanced to the Bosporus, after having
conquered all the countries situated between Great Armenia, Georgia,
the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, Albania, and Lesser Armenia (1081).
This was the origin of the sultanate of Iconium and Rum, afterwards Asiatic
Turkey, which played so important a rôle in the time of the Crusades. The
Greeks were driven out of Asia by the victories of Suleiman; and in spite
of their Christian population, Antioch and the cities of Mesopotamia were
obliged to submit to the Turkish yoke. In one of these expeditions Malik
Shah was taken prisoner, and Nizam al-Mulk freed him in a manner as prudent
as it was adroit; but the sultan afterwards turned upon and disgraced
this eminent minister, who was to fall at length by the sword of the Ismailians
at the age of ninety-three.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1092-1218 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At the death of Malik Shah (1092) the Seljuk empire, losing its unity,
broke up into several independent principalities. In vain the sultan in
Persia strove to exercise a sort of supremacy over the other princes of his
family; the four sons of Malik Shah, Mahmud, Barkiyarok, Sinjar, and
Muhammed, divided the land among themselves at the close of protracted
wars that exhausted the resources of the Seljuks without procuring any
beneficial results either to Islam or the Turkish race. From this point the
various countries and provinces that had once formed one realm drifted
further and further asunder. In 1096 the emir Ortok established himself
in Jerusalem with the intention of founding there a hereditary sovereignty
and a governor of Khwarizm; profiting by the intestine troubles of the Seljuks,
he declared his independence, and his successors, commencing a series
of conquests which were to include Mawarannahar, Khorasan, Irak, and
Kerman, renewed the empire of the Ghaznevids. Certain princes of that
race had retained the provinces contiguous to the two banks of the Indus up
to the time when the Ghurids, first at Lahore (1183-1205) and then at Delhi,
undertook the siege of India, ravaging Benares, subjugating Bengal, and
giving birth to the Afghan dynasty in the ancient Paropamisus.</p>

<p>The Ghurids had already been established twenty-five years in the
dominion left by the last of the Ghaznevids when Muhammed, sultan of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Khwarizm, took from them their western provinces, and became nearly as
powerful as Malik Shah had been. At the moment of his greatest splendour
this prince fell a victim to the Mongol invasion (1208-1218).</p>

<p>We have witnessed the development of the antagonism between the
Turkish and Arab races, whereby barbarism threatened to submerge the
Moslem states, as it had menaced Europe in the time of the Germanic invasion.
But by the law of compensation the Turks, while making felt about
them the authority of the sword, imbibed the influence of Arab civilisation,
and adopted with their religion and language their respect for science and the
arts. A comparison of the decadence of the Arabian and Roman empires
offers points of the most striking similarity; in the East the sultans renewed
the glories of the reigns of Theodoric and of Charlemagne, and the school
of Baghdad continued to shed effulgence over all Asia up to the end of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Still without influence, though restored to independence by the weakening
of the Seljuks, the Abbasid caliphs remained in the capital, to which their
authority was mostly confined. No successors of Kaim had revolted against
the tyranny of the Seljuks except Mustarshid (1118-1135) and Rashid
(1135-1136), who both committed acts of resistance, the latter even losing
his life in defending Baghdad against the sultan Massud, whose supremacy
he obstinately refused to recognise.</p>

<p>Massud, grandson of Malik Shah, was still strong enough to command
respect, and during his life-time Muktafi, Rashid’s successor, ventured on no
open rebellion. But at his death, there being disputes as to the rights of
succession, the caliph publicly presented himself as the lawful sovereign, and
after repelling all attacks directed against Baghdad, got himself acknowledged
throughout Irak-Arabia. Affairs remained in this condition for a
century, during which Mustanjid, Mustadi, Nasir, Dhahir, Mustansir, and
Mutasim had not to endure the shame of seeing the government in the
hands of others. They were at liberty to protect commerce and industry,
letters and sciences, without incurring anyone’s censure; and Baghdad, in the
midst of the disturbances which broke forth on all sides, was as an inaccessible
fortress, into which even the rumour of certain bloody engagements
between hot-headed Sunnites and intractable Shiites could penetrate but
feebly.</p>

<h4>ARABS AND TURKS UNITE AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS</h4>

<p>While the power of the Seljuks was gradually declining in the eastern
provinces, what was taking place in the western provinces of the Arabian
empire? At the death of Malik Shah (1092) three sultanates were formed,
those respectively of Aleppo, Iconium, and Damascus, having no connection
with each other, nor with the sultanates of Persia or of Kerman. The
first of these distinct realms extended over Asia Minor, the other two included
the large cities of Jezireh and Syria. A favourable opportunity
now presented itself to the Fatimite caliphs to reconquer some of their
former possessions in those countries; but so fallen were they from their
early greatness that they permitted the names of the Seljuk sultans to be
mentioned in the public prayers at Hedjaz. Far from seeking to arm the
Arabs against the Turks, Mustali, successor to Mustansir, had had but one
aim, that of obtaining certain barren concessions from the Seljuk princes
by intervening in their private quarrels; and moreover an unforeseen incident
had arisen which diverted all minds from internecine troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1097-1171 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The arrival of several armies of Christians, sent to Palestine with the
mission of delivering the Holy City, aroused in the Moslems all their religious
fanaticism. Arabs and Turks suspended their mutual animosity to make
one cause against the common enemy; the danger once past, however,
divisions again broke forth that greatly facilitated the progress of the
Christians. Before the arrival of Godfrey de Bouillon (1097) the army of
Peter the Hermit had perished in the domains of the sultan of Iconium, and
the Moslems, thinking they had nothing more to fear from without, recommenced
their civil wars; thus the disciplined troops of the first true crusaders
found no power to combat stronger than that of the Seljuks divided
among themselves, and after having crossed the mountains of Cilicia they
took the city of Antioch and made an easy entrance into Palestine.</p>

<p>The Moslems everywhere remained divided and without a common head.
To the Fatimite caliphs, Mustali, Emir, Hafidh, Dhafir, Faïz, and Adid,
or rather to their grand viziers, it never occurred to unite with the independent
princes of Syria for the purpose of repulsing the enemy of their
common faith; the main objects of their policy seemed to be to carry on
negotiations with the Turkish emirs, the war against the Franks occupying
a subordinate place in their concern. At the death of Barkiyarok, however,
there suddenly arose a new and powerful defender of Islam.</p>

<p>Imad ad-Din (called “the bloody” by our chroniclers) had distinguished
himself at the court of the Seljuks in Aleppo and Mosul. Organising for
himself under the name of Atabekm a small independent state, he spread
terror among the emirs all about him, and finally attacked the Seljuk sultan
at Aleppo and became master of that town (1127). He next proceeded to
awake in the Moslems their ancient hatred for the name of “Christian”
and commenced against the Franks a sort of guerilla warfare which terminated
in the taking of Edessa, after which he forced the kings of Jerusalem
to make appeal to Europe.</p>

<p>Zenki was succeeded by his sons Saif ad-Din and Nur ad-Din, the latter
of whom proved himself a worthy successor of his father. He harassed the
Franks by repeated attacks, and allowed the two monarchs to exhaust their
forces by vain efforts to take Damascus, which was still under the power
of the Seljuks. When they finally retired, defeated, Nur ad-Din himself
assailed the sultan, who was enfeebled by this long, heroic resistance, took
from him Damascus, and entered Palestine, which he ravaged in every direction.
By a fortunate circumstance he was soon permitted to mingle in the
affairs of Egypt, by offering troops to a vizier for the purpose of suppressing
the caliph Adid. Not receiving the reward promised for this service, he
opened hostilities at once, and several times defeated the kings of Jerusalem,
while his lieutenant, Shirkuh, became master of Egypt and forced the caliph
to bestow upon him the charge of grand vizier. This was the sentence of
death for the Fatimites. Shirkuh’s nephew, Saladin, sharer in his uncle’s
secret designs, carried the revolution to a head, and in less than a month
prayers were said in the mosque in the name of the Baghdad caliph, Nostadi,
and Adid was deposed without a voice being raised in his favour (1171).</p>

<h4>SALADIN AND HIS SUCCESSORS AGAINST THE CRUSADERS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1171-1229 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Scarcely did Saladin get into his hands the resources of the wealthy land
of Egypt than he commenced against the Franks that series of assaults
which has made his name famous. He was later elevated to the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
rank by the universal choice of the Moslems at the death of Nur ad-Din, the
latter’s son having been put aside.</p>

<p>The reign of Saladin, who was the most interesting figure in the history
of the Crusades, represents for us the highest point of Arab civilisation.
Being by birth a Kurd, he cannot be said to belong to the Turkish race,
though he possessed the warlike instincts of a Turk, joined to a superior
intelligence. In Godfrey de Bouillon and Richard the Lion-hearted are
personified the piety, generosity, and valour of Christian chivalry; Saladin
is no less the hero of the Moslem world. Unfaltering
courage, magnanimity, a spirit of strict
justice, and unshakable fidelity to his plighted
word were among his principal virtues. Passing
his life as he did in the midst of wars, he
had little opportunity to foster the arts of peace;
yet he was no stranger to letters and the sciences,
and he neglected no opportunity to elevate
himself in the esteem of his people. Saladin
was the first to unite under one control the forces
of Syria and Egypt, and therein lies the secret of
his success against the crusaders.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p229.jpg" width="150" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Crusader of the Third Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>At his entrance into Palestine, Jerusalem was
a prey to the worst disorders, owing to the chiefs
of the Crusade not being content to guard the
sacred places that had been entrusted to them,
but aspiring to govern all the cities and strongholds.
The Holy City fell immediately into his
power. The Moslems took possession of the temples
as mosques, and besieged all the maritime
towns; but a check inflicted upon them at Tyre
revived the courage of the Franks and enabled
them to await the arrival of Richard and Philip
Augustus. The Third Crusade followed in 1187-1192,
but Jerusalem could not be conquered by
the Christians in spite of the bravery of the English
king. The magnanimity shown by the sultan
of Egypt in the treatment of his prisoners is well known; he set all the
foreign knights at liberty, merely stipulating that each should bestow his
name upon some newborn child.</p>

<p>Several months after the departure of Richard, Saladin died at Damascus,
admired by his enemies and regretted by Moslems, who foresaw that new
divisions would arise. Indeed three Eyyubid states at once came into being;
one in Egypt, another in Damascus, Jerusalem, and Lower Syria, and the
third in Aleppo and Upper Syria. Three sons of Saladin had divided the
states left by their father, two of them being despoiled by their uncle Adil
Saif ad-Din, who remained master of Egypt and Damascus. Malik Adil,
called Saphedin in our chronicles, was the sworn enemy of the Franks;
he took from them the city of Tripolis, and was the determining cause
of the Fifth Crusade.</p>

<p>Malik al-Kamil, his son, became sultan of Egypt in 1218, and graciously
received presents from Frederick II, when that prince entered Palestine at
the head of the Sixth Crusade, and received from him the city of Jerusalem
that had cost the Moslems so many lives. The Eyyubid sultans that
succeeded Malik looked upon the Franks as enemies who must be driven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
from Asia at any cost; and so Jerusalem fell again into infidel hands and
became in turn the possession of the sultans of Egypt and of Damascus.</p>

<p>Thus we find, at the commencement of the thirteenth century, the posterity
of Saladin wielding power over almost the whole of the western part of
the Arabian empire. A descendant of Nur ad-Din, it is true, possessed
a part of Jezireh, and certain Eyyub princes reigned over provinces of the
peninsula; while the name of the Abbasids, last representatives of the former
Arab supremacy, was still proclaimed in public prayers. The Alids and
Fatimites formed a single sect, without unity or political influence. Armenia
and Georgia had reverted to Christianity, and a considerable faction
known in history as the Ismailians, Bathenians, or Assassins had still retained
a certain prominence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1090-1250 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This sect was founded toward the close of the eleventh century by
Hassan Sabba, who succeeded in gaining an absolute ascendency over the
minds of his followers. An enemy alike to Christianity and Islam, he promulgated
a doctrine which was similar to that of the Karmathians, and
among his possessions were several fortresses, in one of which he resided.
The name “assassins” is a corruption of the word <i>hashish</i>, a sort of intoxicating
drink by means of which Hassan Sabba persuaded his followers that
he could initiate them in all the joys of paradise. Hassan assumed the
character of a lesser providence charged with redressing wrongs and punishing
untruth; and as he at the same time permitted all sorts of brigandage
on the part of his sectarians, the dynasty he established terrorised all western
Asia for more than two centuries. They carried their arms into Syria,
where they erected fortifications and pillaged all the caravans that passed
through. As late as the thirteenth century they possessed stations in Irak
and Syria, not far from Damascus and Aleppo.</p>

<h4>THE MONGOLS UNDER JENGHIZ KHAN INVADE WESTERN ASIA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1220-1258 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Such was the situation of the oriental world when a new race of conquerors,
the Mongols, descended upon western Asia. Like the Turks the
Mongols formed one particular branch of the Scythian race, but had preserved,
in the depths of Tatary, their primitive customs and religion. Their life
was nomadic, their organisation tribal, and obedience to their chiefs, together
with love of war and pillage, were their distinguishing characteristics.</p>

<p>Jenghiz Khan was already ruler of Tatary and Northern China when he
directed his movements westward and menaced Mawarannahar (1219). This
province belonged at the time to Muhammed, sultan of Khwarizm, who was at
war with Nasir, caliph of Baghdad, for a very serious cause. Nasir, alarmed
at the growing power of Muhammed, had armed the Ghurid princes against
him; whereat Muhammed had summoned to a grand council in his palace a
number of doctors and jurists whose decision could not be doubtful, and had
declared the reign of the Abbasids, usurpers of the caliphate, to be at an end.
A descendant of Ali, Ala ad-Din, was proclaimed caliph in place of Nasir,
and a mighty expedition was prepared against Baghdad. Nasir was saved
by the arrival of the Mongols at that juncture, the sultan being obliged to
direct his entire force toward Mawarannahar, where it was cut to pieces.
Muhammed himself fled to an island in the Caspian Sea, leaving his son Jelal
ad-Din to meet and resist the invaders as best he might (1220). Courageous
to foolhardiness, this prince would actually have opposed a successful resistance
to the terrible enemy had he been supported by a people determined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
defend their homes at any cost; but betrayed and abandoned by those upon
whom he should have been able to rely, he experienced the sorrow of seeing
the hordes of Jenghiz Khan sweep devastatingly through Mawarannahar,
Khwarizm, Gilan, and Aderbaijan. When the conqueror, master of 1,700
square leagues, retired to his own capital, Karakorum (1220-1227), Jelal
ad-Din, who had taken refuge in India, returned, and all the populations who
had escaped subjugation flocked to his banners. Out of the remains of his
father’s possessions he formed a new empire which extended from the source
of the Ganges to Mosul, and for yet a little while Baghdad was secure against
attack by the Mongols. But Ogdai became khan by the consent of his father,
Jenghiz, and all the greatest chiefs immediately set out to invade the domains
of Jelal ad-Din, so that the latter was again reduced to flight, and later found
death at the hands of an assassin.</p>

<p>Ogdai was less fortunate in his attempts against the sultan of Iconium and
against Baghdad, which was ably defended by the caliph Mustansir (1235-1241).
Kuyuk his successor (1241-1251) also made but little progress and
had to be content with driving from his court the ambassadors of the caliph
and of the sultan. Mangu Khan, who reigned next, was seized with a desire
for conquest, and sent his brothers Kublai and Hulagu on missions of
aggrandisement. While Kublai was occupied in completing the submission
of China, Hulagu left Karakorum at the head of a numerous army and
besieged Baghdad, with which he had already held secret communication.
The caliph Mustasim, informed of his approach, made no attempt at resistance,
and for seven days his capital was at the mercy of the Mongols, who pillaged
and destroyed on all sides, burning many priceless manuscripts that they
found in the libraries and colleges. Mustasim was strangled and his corpse
dragged around the walls of Baghdad, which had been witnesses of all the
different phases of the Abbasids’ rise and fall&mdash;their grandeur, their decadence,
and their closing ignominy.</p>

<p>The Mongols had now only a step to take to seek the conquest of Egypt
and Syria; but they encountered the mamelukes, whom they were unable to
vanquish. As their name indicates, the mamelukes were Circassian slaves
whom Saladin’s successors had imported to their palaces, and who renewed at
Cairo the insubordination and excesses of which the Turkish soldiery had been
guilty at Baghdad.</p>

<p>When the Khwarizmians fled to Syria before Jenghiz Khan, the sultan of
Damascus gave to the Franks Tiberius, Jerusalem, and Ascalon in return
for their aid. Now the sultan of Egypt and his mamelukes joined forces
with the Khwarizmians, and during a series of combats in which Jerusalem
was taken and retaken several times, they concluded by turning upon their
own allies and almost destroying them (1240-1245). Three years later
they repulsed at Massur the attack of St. Louis, who had begun an invasion
of Egypt. In 1250 a revolution occurred which changed the whole face of
the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1258-1517 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The mamelukes, dissatisfied with the treaty they had concluded with the
king of France, their prisoner, rose in revolt and proclaimed one of their
chiefs, Muiz ad-Din, sultan. St. Louis, who had retired to Palestine, sought
in vain to raise up enemies against the mamelukes by entering into relations
with the khan of the Mongols, and the leader of the Ismailians. Syria, after
having been briefly occupied by Hulagu, who put an end to the sultanates of
Aleppo and Damascus (1258), remained permanently, together with Jezireh,
in the hands of the mamelukes. The Franks lost successively their remaining
possessions and a new dynasty of Abbasid caliphs arose, who for over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
two centuries exercised no higher function than that of bestowing a sort of
religious consecration upon the sovereigns of Egypt. In 1517 the Ottoman
Turks, already masters of Constantinople and Asia Minor, exterminated the
mamelukes, and extended their authority over all the countries known to-day
under the name of Asiatic Turkey.</p>

<p>Situated as they were in the midst of incessant revolutions, and suffering
from the onslaught of barbarian races from the north, the Arabs began
gradually to disappear; but the great movement they imparted to civilisation
has never been lost in Asia, and traces of their beneficent influence are
still everywhere apparent. We have seen the Seljuk, Malik Shah, borrow
from the school of Baghdad the reforms he introduced into the Persian calendar;
before him Mahmud, the Ghaznevid, had called to his councils a
universal genius&mdash;Albiruni, who exercised a remarkable influence upon the
century in which he lived; the Mongul, Hulagu, who could not save from
the flames the precious instruments and records that had been the result
of years of enlightened research, permitted the celebrated mathematician,
Nasir ad-Din Thusi, to build a magnificent observatory at Meraga; and
lastly his brother Kublai, when he became emperor of China, carried with
him into the celestial empire all the lore and wisdom of the Occident.</p>

<p>Under the first Ottoman emperors we shall note the use by eminent
writers of the old dialect of the Abbasids; but this is the last faint effulgence
of a protracted period of glory. The tyranny of the sword is to usurp
power over all the Asiatic continent&mdash;among the Manchurian Tatars in the
east, the Usbegs in the north, the Sophia in Persia, and the Ottoman Turks
in the west. From an intellectual point of view the Orient is to fall again
into immobility and torpor, until the nations of the west, carrying out on a
grander scale the work begun by the Arabs, shall so develop all the forces of
science and of human industry as to react on Asia, and infuse into the
swarming populations of those vast spaces the spirit of a new life.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_8b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_8b">b</a></span></p>

<p>We have now seen the sceptre of Mohammed pass from his own race.
It remains to resume the story of the Arabs in Spain.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#parthians_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX. THE DECLINE OF THE MOSLEMS IN SPAIN</h3>

<div class="sidenote">[961-1492 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Al-Hakam II, the son and successor of Abd ar-Rahman, inherited all the
great qualities of his father. He was, however, averse to war, fond of tranquillity,
and immoderately attached to literature. His agents were constantly
employed in the East in purchasing scarce and curious books; he himself
wrote to every author of reputation for a copy of that author’s works, for
which he paid royally; and wherever he could not purchase a book, he caused
it to be transcribed. By this means he collected an extensive library, the
unfinished catalogue of which, in the time of Ibn Hayan, reached forty-four
volumes. On his accession, that he might devote his chief time to the public
administration yet not neglect interests so dear to him, he confided to one
of his brothers the care of his library, and to another the duty of protecting
literary institutions and of rewarding the learned. His reign is the golden
age of Arabian literature in Spain.</p>

<p>He appears never to have been engaged in war with the Christians; for
though the Arabian writers mention the siege and reduction of an Estefano
de Gormas by the king in person, no mention is made of such a fact by the
contemporary bishop of Astorga. In Africa, his general, Khalib, successfully
repressed an insurrection of two local governors, and rendered the walis of
Fez again dependent on the throne of Cordova.</p>

<p>As Hisham II, the son and successor of Al-Hakam, was but eleven years
old when he ascended the throne, the regency was conferred by the queen-mother
on her secretary, Muhammed ben Abdallah, a man of great genius,
valour, and activity. Muhammed, better known as Almansor, may, in fact,
be regarded as the king; for he alone throughout life governed the realm.
Hisham was too feeble, too despicable, too much addicted to slothful pleasures,
to command even the passing notice of the people.</p>

<h4>ALMANSOR</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[977-998 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The wars of Almansor with the Christians, which proved so fatal to them,
occupy the most prominent part of his administration. Without acquainting
them with his intention to disturb a peace which had continued during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the reign of Al-Hakam, in 977 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> he penetrated into Galicia, where booty
and captives in abundance rewarded the avarice of his followers. In the two
years succeeding, he frequently renewed his incursions, both into Galicia and
Tarragona, without encountering much opposition. Under an infant king,
the Christians were too much occupied with their internal dissensions to
unite even in defence of their country. In short, his destructive inroads are
said to have occurred twice every year during a great part of his life.</p>

<p>In 981 Almansor not only reduced Zamora, but took possession of many
other fortresses in the neighbourhood. The ensuing campaigns were no less
successful; they are, however, too numerous to be particularised. It will be
sufficient to state that in 983 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> he took Gormaz; in 984, Simancas; in
986, Sepulveda; in 987, he destroyed Coimbra, which, however, the Moors
themselves soon rebuilt; in 989, he reduced Artienza, Osma, and Alcova;
in 992, Montemayor; in 994, San Estevan and Corunna; in 995, Aguilar; in
996, the important cities of Leon and Astorga, with a great number of inferior
places; and in the same year he laid waste the whole of Galicia, not sparing
even the holy precincts of Compostella. His restless barbarity, and still
more his innumerable acts of sacrilege, are dwelt upon with indignant wonder
by the old chroniclers. But many precious things escaped his fury; and
many more, such as the bodies of saints and kings, were removed by the terrified
Christians from Leon to Oviedo&mdash;for the mountains of the Asturias
again became the inaccessible asylum of the native monarchy. The bells of
Compostella were sent to Cordova, to be melted into lamps for the famous
mosque of that city. But the indignant saint sought for revenge; for, on
their return to Cordova, the misbelievers were seized with a violent dysentery,
which carried off the greater portion of them; comparatively few (if the
bishop of Astorga<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_9b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_9b">b</a></span> is to be believed, not one) returned to the Mohammedan
capital. Later writers than Sampiro assign&mdash;perhaps with truth&mdash;much of
the honour to the Christians, who, on learning the extent of the disease, pursued
the misbelievers, and cut off such as Santiago would have spared. However
this be, on the departure of the invaders, the Christians issued from their
mountains, rebuilt their towns, and restored the church of Compostella.</p>

<p>During these successful operations against the kings of Leon, Almansor
had time to signalise his administration in other parts. In 985 he seized on
Barcelona; and would have carried his victorious banners to the Pyrenees,
had not his march been arrested by intelligence from Africa. Al-Hasam, an
emir of Almaghreb, who during the late reign had usurped the government of
the whole province, and been expelled by Khalib, had fled to Egypt. By
Nazar, the sultan of that country, he had been favourably received; and on
his return he bore an order to the governor of Tunis to provide him with
three thousand horse, and some Berber infantry. His little army was
speedily reinforced; for in that country, more perhaps than any other on
the face of the earth, he who endeavoured to disturb existing institutions
was sure to receive some degree of co-operation. The general of Almansor&mdash;for
Hisham was nobody&mdash;was defeated and compelled to seek refuge in
Ceuta. But Abdul-Malik, the son of Almansor, hastened to the scene of
strife, and in two battles annihilated the forces of his enemy, whom he made
prisoner; and who, though relying on the faith of treaties, was sent to Spain
and executed. With Al-Hasam ended the dynasty of the Edris, which had
ruled in Fez about two hundred years. In 987, however, the flames of war
were rekindled by Balkin ben Zeiri, and nourished by his son and successor.
After various alternations of fortune the country was pacified by the victories
of Abdul-Malik, who was rewarded by the dignity of emir of Almaghreb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<h4>DECAY OF POWER</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[998-1009 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But the chief attention of the hajib was always turned to the natural
enemy of his nation. From his elevation he had meditated the destruction
of the Christian power. Now that Africa was pacified, and his son able to
send him a supply of Berber troops, he resolved to execute his project, and as
usual to commence with Leon. His preparations which he had been long
making were immense; but this circumstance saved Spain. Terrified at the
approaching danger, Sancho king of Navarre, and another of the same name,
the count of Castile, entered into a confederacy with the regency of Leon
(Alfonso V, who then reigned, was only in his eighth year), to repel the common
foe. This was the first time during the administration of Almansor that
the three powers thus united; they were, in fact, generally at war with one
another; a circumstance which, coupled with the frequent minority of the
kings of Leon, will fully account for the unparalleled triumphs of that hero.</p>

<p>In 1001 the Mohammedan army, in two formidable bodies, ascended the
Duero, and encountered the Christians in the vicinity of Calatanazar, a
place between Soria and Medina Cœli. When Almansor perceived the
widespread tents of the Christians, he was struck with surprise. The battle
commenced with break of day, and was maintained with unexampled obstinacy
until darkness separated the combatants.</p>

<p>That the loss on both sides was immense, may well be conceived from the
desperate valour of the two armies. If Almansor by his frequent and impetuous
assaults broke the adverse line, it was soon reformed, and the next moment
saw the Christian knights in the very heart of the infidels. Overcome
with fatigue, with anxiety, and still more with the mortification of having
been so unexpectedly repelled, he slowly retired to his tent, to await the
customary visits of his generals. The extent of his disaster was unknown to
him, until he learned, from the few who arrived, the fate of their brother
chiefs. To hazard a second field, he well saw, would be destruction; and
burning with shame he ordered a retreat. Whether the Mohammedans were
disturbed or not in their retreat is uncertain, but Almansor himself proceeded
no further than the frontiers of Castile, before he sank under the weight of
his despair. Obstinately refusing all consolation&mdash;some accounts say all
support&mdash;he died in the arms of his son Abdul-Malik, who had hastened
from Africa to see him, the third day of the moon Shaffal (1002).</p>

<p>Almansor was formed for a great sovereign. He was not only the most
able of generals, and the most valiant of soldiers, but he was an enlightened
statesman, an active governor, an encourager of science and the arts, and a
magnificent rewarder of merit. His loss was fatal to Cordova. The national
sorrow was mitigated for a moment by the appointment of Abdul-Malik to
the vacant post of hajib. This minister promised to tread in the steps of his
illustrious father; his administration both in Africa and Spain was signalised
by great spirit and valour; but, unlike Almansor, he found the Christians
too well prepared to be taken by surprise. He was suddenly seized with
excruciating pains&mdash;the effect, probably, of poison; and he died in 1008, in
the seventh year of his administration. With him ended the prosperity of
Mohammedan Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1009-1012 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Abd ar-Rahman, the brother of Abdul-Malik, was next advanced to the
post of hajib. He prevailed on the childless monarch to designate him as
successor to the throne. This rash act occasioned his ruin, and was one of
those which accelerated with fearful rapidity the decline of the state. The
race of the Omayyads was not extinct; and Muhammed, a prince of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
house, resolved to chastise the presumption of the hajib. He rapidly
marched on the city, forcibly seized on the palace and king, and proclaimed
the deposition of the hajib, who later was wounded, taken, and crucified by
the barbarous victor.</p>

<p>Muhammed first caused himself to be appointed hajib; but the modest
title soon displeased, and he aspired to that of king. He who had successfully
rebelled against his sovereign, and who held that sovereign a prisoner
in the palace, was not likely to hesitate at greater crimes. By his orders
Hisham was secretly conveyed to an obscure fortress, and there confined.
At the same time the death of the king was publicly announced; a person
resembling him in stature and countenance was, we are told, substituted for
him, and laid in the royal sepulchre; and Muhammed, in conformity with
the pretended will of his predecessor, was hailed as prince of the believers.</p>

<p>But the usurper was far from secure in his seat of power. The dangerous
example which he himself had set of successful rebellion, was too attractive
not to be followed; and his own acts hastened the invitation. Incensed
against the African guard which had supported the factions of Abd ar-Rahman,
he dissolved that formidable body, and ordered them to be expelled
the city. They naturally resisted; but with the aid of the populace he at
length forced them beyond the walls, and threw after them the head of their
chief. The exasperated Africans swore to be revenged, and proclaimed
Suleiman, of the royal blood of the Omayyads, the successor of Hisham.
As the forces of Suleiman were too few to make an open attack on Cordova,
he traversed the country in search of partisans, and added greatly to the
number of his followers. He even procured many Christian auxiliaries from
Sancho, count of Castile. In an obstinately contended battle he overthrew the
usurper; twenty thousand troops of the latter being left on the field. The
victor hastened to Cordova, and assumed the reins of sovereignty. There,
however, he did not long remain; he felt he was unpopular; and to avoid
assassination, he shut himself up in the palace of Azhara.</p>

<p>The African domination&mdash;for such his was&mdash;became odious to the native
Moslems; nor was the feeling lessened by the presence of the Christian auxiliaries.
The latter were honourably dismissed; but still there was no solid
security for Suleiman, against whom plots were frequent. To add to his
vexations, Muhammed, aided by Count Raymond of Barcelona and several
walis, advanced against Cordova. The African party was defeated, its
chief forced to flee, and Muhammed again recognised as king. But throughout
these contentions, the vicissitudes of success and failure followed each
other with amazing celerity. Though pursued by a superior force headed
in person by his bitter rival, Suleiman turned round and inflicted a terrible
defeat on Muhammed, who precipitately fled, almost alone, to the capital.
The victor followed him, seized on the heights in the vicinity of Cordova,
and laid siege to the place. Muhammed was weakened by the desertion of
his Christian allies, and still more by the disaffection of the mob, which bears
about the same feeling to unfortunate princes as the kindred cur towards the
meanly clad visitant. The hajib Uhada, a man who had contrived to keep
his post in every recent change of government, took advantage of this alienation
of popular feeling; he did not declare for Suleiman, as little of a
favourite as the present ruler; but he suddenly drew Hisham from confinement,
and showed him to the astonished populace. Astonishment gave way
to transport; and transport, as usual, to excesses. Muhammed was beheaded,
his corpse torn in pieces by the new converts to legitimacy (1012 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), and
the head thrown into the camp of Suleiman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1012-1023 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But Suleiman refused to recognise the grandson of the great Abd ar-Rahman.
Having formed an alliance with Obaid Allah, the son of Muhammed
and wali of Toledo, he aimed at nothing less than the deposition of the king.
At first his efforts were unpromising; his ally was defeated, made prisoner,
and beheaded. Fortune favoured him in other respects. Suleiman marched
on Cordova. In vain did the hajib Khairan, the successor of Uhada, whom
Hisham in a fit of suspicion had put to death, attempt to defend the city.
The inhabitants opened one of the gates; the Africans entered, fought, and
conquered; their chief was a second time saluted as king, and Hisham forever
disappeared from the stage of royalty&mdash;probably at the same moment
from that of life.</p>

<p>Suleiman began his reign&mdash;for so long as Hisham lived he cannot be
properly ranked among the kings of Cordova&mdash;by rewarding his adherents
in the most lavish manner. He confirmed them, as he had promised, in the
hereditary possession of their fiefs; thus engrafting on a strangely foreign
stock the feudal institution of more northern nations. This was the signal
for the creation of numerous independent sovereignties, and consequently
for the ruin of Mohammedan Spain. The strength of the misbelievers had
consisted in their unity under the religious sway of their caliphs; when this
strong bulwark was dissolved the scattered fragments of their empire might
for a moment resist the eager assaults of the Christians; but these must
inevitably be swept away in the end by the overwhelming flood.</p>

<p>The hajib Khairan, who had escaped to his government of Almeria, swore
to be revenged on this new usurper. As, however, no forces which he could
bring into the field could contend for a moment with those of Suleiman, he
passed over to Ceuta to interest the governor, Ali ben Hammud, in his project.
Suleiman was forsaken by most of the walis, his allies&mdash;they can no longer
be called subjects; his troops deserted to swell the ranks of his enemy; and
in a battle near Seville, his Andalusian adherents turned against him, and
thereby decided his fate.</p>

<p>Ali was proclaimed king of Mohammedan Spain, but not until search
had been vainly made for Hisham. The crown was not destined to sit
more lightly on his head than on that of his immediate predecessor. He
found an enemy where he least expected one; he was stifled in the bath
by his Slavonic attendants, and the report circulated that his death was
natural.</p>

<p>Al-Kasim ben Hammud, brother of the deceased king, seized on the throne.
A powerful conspiracy was formed to dethrone him. His palace was assailed;
and though, by the valour of his guards, it held out fifty days, at the end of
that time most of them fell in an attempt to effect their escape. Some of the
more humane of the assailants secretly conveyed Kasim beyond the walls
and provided him with a small escort of cavalry, which conveyed him to
Xeres. When this intelligence was known at Cordova, the Alameris, or
party of the family of the great Almansor, which acted a conspicuous part
in all these commotions and which adhered to the fortunes of the Omayyads,
proclaimed as king Abd ar-Rahman ben Hisham, brother of the usurper
Muhammed.</p>

<p>Muhammed ben Abd ar-Rahman, cousin of the king, a man of boundless
wealth, succeeded in corrupting the chief nobles of the city. In the silence
of night he armed a resolute band of his creatures, who hastened to the
palace, and massacred the soldiers on duty. After a reign of only forty-seven
days, the king’s bedchamber was entered and he was pierced with a
thousand wounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<h4>END OF THE OMAYYADS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1023-1238 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Muhammed II reaped the reward of his crime. His successor was Yahya,
who perished in an ambuscade (1025). The next prince on whom the
choice of the Cordovans fell, Hisham III, brother of Abd ar-Rahman al-Mortada,
was naturally loth to accept a crown which had destroyed so many
of its wearers. In the end, however, being rather forced than persuaded to
relinquish his scruples, he left his retirement. Unhappily, he had but too
much reason to find
that neither private
virtues nor public services
have much influence
over the bulk of
mankind; and that
the absolute king who
has not the power to
make himself feared
will not long be suffered
to reign. In
1031 a licentious mob
paraded the streets of
Cordova, and loudly
demanded his deposition.
He did not wait
the effects of their violence;
with unfeigned
satisfaction he retired
to private life, in which
he passed unmolested
the remainder of his
days. The remembrance
of his virtues
long survived him;
and by all the Arabic
writers of his country
he is represented as
too good for his age.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/p238.jpg" width="350" height="475" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Alhambra</span></p>
</div>

<p>With Hisham III
ended the caliphate of
the West, and the noble
race of the Omayyads.
If the succession
was interrupted by Ali, and Al-Kasim, and Yahya, who though descended
from a kindred stock were not of the same family, that interruption was but
momentary; especially as Abd ar-Rahman IV reigned at Jaen, while the last
two princes were acknowledged at Cordova. From this period 1031 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> to
the establishment of the kingdom of Grenada in 1238 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, there was no
supreme chief of Mohammedan Spain, if we except the fleeting conquerors
who arrived from Africa, the fabric of whose dominion was as suddenly
destroyed as it was erected.</p>

<p>Vicious as is the constitution of all Mohammedan governments, and
destructible as are the bases on which they are founded, the reader cannot
fail to have been struck with the fate of this great kingdom. It can scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
be said to have declined; it fell at once. Not thirty years have elapsed
since the great Almansor wielded the resources of Africa and Spain, and
threatened the entire destruction of the Christians, whom he had driven
into an obscure corner of this vast peninsula. Now Africa is lost; the
Christians hold two-thirds of the country; the petty but independent governors,
the boldest of whom trembled at the name of Almansor, openly
insult the ruler of Cordova, whose authority extends little further than the
walls of his capital. Assuredly, so astounding a catastrophe has no parallel
in all history. Other kingdoms, indeed, as powerful as Cordova, have been
perhaps as speedily deprived of their independence; but if they have been subdued
by invading enemies, their resources, their vigour, to a certain extent
their greatness have long survived their loss of that blessing. Cordova,
in the very fullness of her strength, was torn to pieces by her turbulent
children.</p>

<h4>INDEPENDENT KINGDOMS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1031-1094 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The decline and dissolution of the Mohammedan monarchy, or western
caliphate afforded the ambitious local governors throughout the peninsula
the opportunity for which they had long sighed&mdash;that of openly asserting
their independence of Cordova and of assuming the title of kings.</p>

<p>But Cordova, however weakened, was not willing thus suddenly to lose
her hold on her ancient subjects; she resolved to elect a sovereign who
should endeavour to subdue these audacious rebels, and restore her ancient
splendour. The disasters which had accompanied the last reigns of the
Omayyad princes had strongly indisposed the people to the claims of that
illustrious house. Jehwar ben Muhammed surrounded himself by a council
which comprised some of the most distinguished citizens, and without the
advice of which he undertook no one thing, not even the nomination to
public offices. Of that council he was but the president, possessing but one
vote like the remaining members; so that Cordova presented the appearance
rather of a republic than of a monarchy. He introduced a degree of tranquillity
and commercial activity unknown since the death of the great
Almansor. But the same success did not attend him in his efforts to restore
the supremacy of Cordova. Whatever might be the internal dissensions
of the petty kings, the success of some, the failure of others, none
thought of recognising his superiority. To recount the perpetually recurring
struggles of these reguli for the increase of their states, their alliances,
their transient successes or hopeless failures, or even their existence, would
afford neither interest nor instruction to the reader. Such events only can be
noticed as are either signal in themselves, or exercised more than a passing
influence on the condition of the Mohammedan portion of the peninsula.</p>

<p>After triumphing over some neighbouring kings, who dreaded his increasing
power, the sovereign of Seville prepared to invade the possessions of
Jehwar; but death surprised him before those preparations were completed.
His son, Muhammed Al-Mucteded, who succeeded him, was as ambitious as
himself, but more luxurious. All southern Andalusia came into the power
of Al-Mucteded, yet his ambition was far from satisfied. For some time he
remained in alliance with Muhammed, the son and successor of Jehwar, in
the throne of Cordova; but he gained possession of that ancient capital
by stratagem. After many years of continued warfare, the king of Seville
and Cordova became, not merely the most powerful, but almost the only
independent sovereign of Mohammedan Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>Yahya al-Kadi, the son and successor of Ibn Dylnun on the throne of
Toledo, inherited neither the courage nor the abilities of that prince. Sunk
in the lowest sensuality, he regarded with indifference the growing success
of Muhammed. He became at length so contemptible that his very subjects
rose and expelled him. He applied for aid to the ally of his father, Alfonso
VI king of Leon; but that prince, though under the greatest obligations to
the memory of the father, was persuaded by the king of Seville to adopt a
hostile policy towards the son. It seems, indeed, as if Muhammed and
Alfonso, in the treaty which they concluded at the instance of the former,
had tacitly agreed not to interrupt each other in the execution of the designs
each had long formed. The victorious Alfonso triumphed over all opposition,
and prosecuted the siege with a vigour which might have shown the misbelievers
how formidable an enemy awaited them all, and how necessary were
their combined efforts to resist him. But Muhammed, the only enemy whom
the Christian hero had to dread, was no less occupied in deriving his share
of the advantages secured by the treaty&mdash;in reducing the strong towns of
Murcia and Granada. After a siege of three years, Toledo was reduced to
the last extremity, and was compelled to capitulate. On the 25th of May,
1085 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, Alfonso triumphantly entered this ancient capital of the Goths,
which had remained in the power of the misbelievers about 374 years.</p>

<p>The conquest of Toledo was far from satisfying the ambition of Alfonso;
he rapidly seized on the fortresses of Madrid, Maqueda, Guadalajara, and
established his dominion on both banks of the Tagus. Muhammed now began
seriously to repent his treaty with the Christian, and to tremble even for his
own possessions. He vainly endeavoured to divert his ally from the projects
of aggrandisement which that ally had evidently formed. Muhammed saw
that unless he leagued himself with those whose subjugation had hitherto
been his constant object,&mdash;the princes of his faith,&mdash;his and their destruction
was inevitable. The magnitude of the danger compelled him to solicit their
alliance. Such resistance as Mohammedan Spain alone could offer seemed
hopeless. With this conviction in their hearts two of the most influential cadis
proposed an appeal to the celebrated African conqueror, Yusuf ben Tashufin,
whose arm alone seemed able to preserve the faith of Islam in the peninsula.
The proposal was received with general applause by all present; they did not
make the very obvious reflection that when a nation admits into its bosom an
ally more powerful than itself, it admits at the same time a conqueror. The
wali of Malaga alone, Abdallah ben Zagut, had courage to oppose the dangerous
embassy under consideration. “You mean to call in the aid of the Almoravids!
Are you ignorant that these fierce inhabitants of the deserts resemble their
own native tigers? Suffer them not, I beseech you, to enter the fertile plains
of Andalusia and Granada! Doubtless they would break the iron sceptre
which Alfonso intends for us; but you would still be doomed to wear the
chains of slavery. Do you not know that Yusuf has taken all the cities of
Almaghreb, that he has subdued the powerful tribes of the East and West,
that he has everywhere substituted despotism for liberty and independence?”
The aged Zagut spoke in vain.</p>

<h4>THE ALMORAVIDS</h4>

<p>Beyond the chain of Mount Atlas, in the deserts of ancient Gætulia,
dwelt two tribes of Arabian descent. At what time they had been expelled,
or had voluntarily exiled themselves from their native Yemen, they knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
not; but tradition taught them that they had been located in the African
deserts from ages immemorial. Yahya ben Ibrahim, belonging to one of
these tribes (that of Gudala), made the pilgrimage of Mecca. Being questioned
by his new friend as to the religion and manners of his countrymen,
he replied that they were sunk in ignorance, both from their isolated situation
in the desert and from their want of teachers. He entreated the
alfaqui to allow some one of his disciples to accompany him into his native
country. With considerable difficulty Abdallah ben Yassim, the disciple of
another alfaqui, was persuaded to accompany the patriotic Yahya. Abdallah
was one of those ruling minds which, fortunately for the peace of society,
nature so seldom produces. Seeing his enthusiastic reception by the tribe
of Gudala, and the influence he was sure of maintaining over it, he formed
the design of founding a sovereignty in the heart of these vast regions. He
prevailed on his obedient disciples to make war on the kindred tribe of
Lamtuna. His ambition naturally increased with his success; in a short
time he had reduced, in a similar manner, the isolated tribes around him.</p>

<p>To his valiant followers of Lamtuna, he now gave the name of Al-Morabethun,
or Almoravids, which signifies men consecrated to the service of
God. The whole country of Darah was gradually subdued by this new
apostle, and his authority was acknowledged over a region extensive enough
to form a respectable kingdom. But though he exercised all the rights of
sovereignty, he prudently abstained from assuming the title. He left to
the emir of Lamtuna the ostensible exercise of temporal power; and when,
in 1058 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, that emir fell in battle, he nominated Abu Bekr ben Omar to
the vacant dignity. His own death, which was that of a warrior, left Abu
Bekr in possession of an undivided sovereignty. The power, and consequently
the reputation of the emir, spread far and wide. Abu Bekr looked
around for a site on which he might lay the foundations of a great city, the
destined metropolis of a great empire; and the city of Morocco began to
rear its head from the valley of Eylana. Before, however, his great work
was half completed, he received intelligence that the tribe of Gudala had
declared a deadly war against that of Lamtuna. As he belonged to the
latter, he naturally trembled for the fate of his kindred; and at the head of
his cavalry he departed for his native deserts, leaving the command of the
army, during his absence, to his cousin, Yusuf ben Tashufin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1070-1103 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Whatever were Yusuf’s other virtues, it will be seen that gratitude, honour,
and good faith were not among the number. Scarcely had his kinsman left
the city than, in pursuance of the design he had formed of usurping the
supreme authority, he began to win the affections of the troops, partly by
his gifts and partly by affability. Nor was his success in war less agreeable
to so fierce and martial a people as the Almoravids. The Berbers were
quickly subdued by him. He had long aspired to the hope of marrying
the beautiful Zainab, sister of Abu Bekr; but the fear of a repulse from the
proud chief of his family had caused him to smother his inclination. He
now disdained to supplicate for that chief’s consent; he married the lady.
Having put the finishing touch to his magnificent city of Morocco, he transferred
thither the seat of his empire. The augmentation of his army was
his next great object; and so well did he succeed in it that he found his
troops exceeded one hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Yusuf had just completed the subjugation of Fez when Abu Bekr returned
from the desert, and encamped in the vicinity of Agmat. With a
force so far inferior to his rival’s, so far from demanding the restitution of
his rights, he durst not even utter one word of complaint; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
he pretended that he had long renounced empire, and that his only wish was
to pass the remainder of his days in the retirement of the desert. With
equal hypocrisy Yusuf humbly thanked him for his abdication; the sheikhs
and walis were summoned to witness the renewed declaration of the emir,
after which the two princes separated. The following day, however, Abu
Bekr received a magnificent present from Yusuf, who, indeed, continued to
send him one every year to the period of his death.</p>

<p>Yusuf had just exchanged his humble title of emir for that of <i>al-muslimin</i>,
or prince of the believers, and of <i>nazir ed-din</i>, or defender of the faith,
when letters from Muhammed reached him. Before he returned a final
answer to the king of Seville, he insisted that the fortress of Algeciras
should be placed in his hands, on the pretence that if fortune were unpropitious
he should have some place to which he might retreat. That Muhammed
should have been so blind as not to perceive the designs involved in the
insidious proposal is almost enough to make one agree with the Arabic historians,
that destiny had decreed he should fall by his own measures.</p>

<p>Alfonso was besieging Saragossa, which he had every expectation of
reducing, when intelligence reached him of Yusuf’s disembarkation. He
resolved to meet the approaching storm. At the head of all the forces he
could muster he advanced towards Andalusia, and encountered Yusuf on
the plains of Zallaka (1086). Alfonso was severely wounded and compelled
to retreat, but not until nightfall, nor until he had displayed a valour worthy
of the greatest heroes. Yusuf now proclaimed the Al-hijed, or holy war, and
invited all the Andalusian princes to join him. But this demonstration of
force proved as useless as the preceding; it ended in nothing; owing partly
to the dissensions of the Mohammedans and partly to the activity of the
Christians, who not only rendered abortive the measures of the enemy but
gained some signal advantages over them. Yusuf was forced to retreat on
Almeida. Whether through the distrust of the Mohammedan princes, who
appear to have penetrated his intention of subjecting them to his empire, or
through his apprehension of Alfonso, he again returned to Africa, to procure
new and more considerable levies. He landed a third time at Algeciras, not
so much with the view of humbling the Christian king as of executing the
perfidious design he had so long formed. For form’s sake, indeed, he
invested Toledo, but he could have entertained no expectation of reducing
it; and when he perceived that the Andalusian princes refused to join him, he
eagerly left that city, and proceeded to secure far dearer and easier interests.
He openly threw off the mask, and commenced his career of spoliation.
After the fall of Muhammed, Yusuf had little difficulty in subduing the
remaining princes of Andalusia.</p>

<p>Thus ended the petty kingdoms of Andalusia, after a stormy existence
of about sixty years, and thus commenced the dynasty of the Almoravids.
For some years after the usurpation of Yusuf, peace appears to have subsisted
in Spain between the Mohammedans and the Christians. Fearing a new
irruption of Africans, Alfonso contented himself with fortifying Toledo;
and Yusuf felt little inclination to renew the war with one whose prowess he
had so fatally experienced. But Christian Spain was, at one moment, near
the brink of ruin. The passion for the Crusades was no less ardently felt
by the Spaniards than by other nations of Europe. Fortunately, Pope
Paschal II, in answer to the representations of Alfonso, declared that the
proper post of every Spaniard was at home, and there were his true enemies.
Yusuf returned to Morocco in 1103, where he died in 1106, after living one
hundred Arabian or about ninety-seven Christian years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1103-1130 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Ali was only in his twenty-third year when he succeeded his father, whose
military talents he inherited, and whom he surpassed in generosity. On
the death of Alfonso, in 1109 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, Ali entered Spain at the head of one
hundred thousand men, to prosecute in person the war against the Christians.
But though he laid waste the territory of Toledo, and invested that city, he
soon abandoned the siege. A second army sent by Ali had no better success.
In 1118 Saragossa, after a siege of some months, fell into the power
of the Christians, and the north of Spain was forever freed from the domination
of the Mohammedans. The following year the Aragonian hero destroyed
twenty thousand of the Africans, who had advanced as far as the
environs of Daroca; while another division of the Almoravids, under Ali in
person, was compelled to retreat before the army of Leon and Castile.</p>

<p>At this very time the empire of the Almoravids was tottering to its fall.
It had never been agreeable to the Mohammedans of Spain, whose manners,
from their intercourse with a civilised people, were comparatively refined.
The sheikhs of Lamtuna were so many insupportable tyrants; the Jews, the
universal agents for the collection of the revenues, were here, as in Poland,
the most pitiless extortioners; every savage from the desert looked with
contempt on the milder inhabitant of the peninsula. The domination of
those strangers was indeed so odious that, except for the divisions between
Alfonso and his ambitious queen, Donna Urraca, who was sovereign in her
own right, all Andalusia might speedily have been subjected to the Christian
yoke. Even while Ali remained in Spain, there was an open revolt of the
inhabitants, who could not longer support the excesses of the barbarian
guard.</p>

<p>But the cause which most menaced the existence of Ali’s throne, and
which was destined to change the whole face of western Africa and southern
Spain, originated, like the power of Yusuf ben Tashufin, in the deserts bordering
on Mount Atlas. Muhammed ben Abdallah, the son of a lamp-lighter in
the mosque of Cordova, was distinguished for great curiosity and an insatiable
thirst for knowledge. Whether Muhammed was a fanatic or a knave,
or composed of a large mixture of both, is not easy to be determined. He
wandered from place to place, zealously preaching doctrines dangerous to
the faith of Islam. His reception, however, was long cool; and from one
town, where he had held forth in the mosque, he was compelled to flee to
Tlemcen. On his way he fell in with a youth, Abdul-Mumin by name,
whom he persuaded to share his fortunes. The two friends subsequently
travelled to Fez, and thence to Morocco.</p>

<p>The artful rebel was permitted to follow his vocation till the excitement
produced by his fanatic appeals to the ignorant populace was too great to be
overlooked, and he was ordered to leave Morocco. At a short distance from
the city, however, probably in its public cemetery, he built a hut among the
graves, as a residence for himself and his faithful Abdul-Mumin. As he
had anticipated, he was soon followed by crowds who venerated his prophetic
character, and who listened with pleasure to vehement denunciations which
fell with terrific effect on their superiors. He inveighed against the impiety
of the Almoravids, who appear not to have been more popular in Mauretania
than in Spain. Ali ordered the rebel to be secured. Muhammed, who had
timely notice of the fate intended him, fled to Agmat, accompanied by a host
of proselytes; but finding that his liberty was still in danger, he hastily
retreated to Tinmal in the province of Sus. His success in this region was
so great that he had soon an army of disciples, all devoted to his will, because
all believed in his divine mission. For some time he preached to them the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
coming of the great mahdi, who should teach all men the right way and
cause virtue and happiness to reign over the whole earth; but he carefully
refrained from acknowledging himself to be the mighty prophet, doubtless
because he was fearful of shocking the credulity even of his own followers.
One day, in conformity with a preconcerted plan, as he was expatiating on
the change to be effected by the long-promised teacher and ruler, Abdul-Mumin
and nine other men arose, saying: “Thou announcest a mahdi; the
description applies only to thyself. Be our mahdi and imam; we swear to
obey thee!” The Berbers, influenced by the example, in the same manner
arose and vowed fidelity even unto death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1130-1143 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From this moment he assumed the high title of mahdi, and proclaimed
himself as the founder of a new people. He instituted a regular government,
confiding the administration to Abdul-Mumin, his minister, with nine
associates, but reserving the control to himself. Seventy Berbers or Alarabs
formed the council of the new government. An army of ten thousand horse
and a far greater number of foot was speedily organised, with which he took
the road to Agmat just as Ali returned to Morocco from Spain. The Almohads
[<i>Unitarians</i>], for such was the name assumed by the followers of
Muhammed, defeated the troops of Ali four times.</p>

<p>At length Muhammed resolved to reduce the capital of Morocco. At
his voice forty thousand men took the field. The preparations of Ali were
immense; one hundred thousand men were ranged round his standard.
They were again defeated, were pursued to the very walls of Morocco, and
that capital was invested with a vigour which showed that the Almohads
were intent on its reduction. But Ali led his troops against the rebels,
whom he completely routed. Abdul-Mumin rallied the fugitives, and effected
an orderly retreat. But time was necessary to repair the misfortune, especially
as some of the savage tribes of the desert withdrew from Muhammed’s
banner, on finding that his power was that of a mere mortal.</p>

<p>In 1130 the mahdi commanded all to assemble the following day near the
great mosque, to bid adieu to their chief. All wondered at the command,
except such as were acquainted with his long hidden disease. He exhorted
them to persevere in the doctrine he had taught them; announced his
approaching death; and when he saw them dissolved in tears, inculcated
the duty of resignation to the divine will. He then retired with his beloved
disciple, to whom he presented the book containing the tenets of his faith&mdash;a
book which he had received from the hands of Al-Gazali. The fourth
day he expired. The chiefs of the state were soon afterwards assembled to
deliberate on the form of government; a monarchy was chosen; and by their
unanimous suffrages Abdul-Mumin was proclaimed imam and almumenin.</p>

<p>For the next three years the new caliph was diligently employed in extending
his conquests. The whole country, from the mountains of Darah to
Salee, all Fez and Tasa, received his spiritual and temporal yoke. The empire
of the Almoravids was now bounded within a narrow sphere. Ali became
dejected and unhappy; his troops were everywhere defeated; his towns were
rapidly delivered into the power of a savage enemy, who had vowed his
destruction; and though, in compliance with the advice of his counsellors,
he associated with him in the empire his son Tashufin, whose exploits in
Spain had obtained him much celebrity, that prince was too busily occupied
with the Christians and his discontented subjects of Andalusia to prop
the declining empire in Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1143-1145 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Tashufin ben Ali succeeded in 1143 to his father, who died at Morocco&mdash;more
from grief at the declining state of affairs than from any other cause.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
His first object was to assemble an army to strike another blow for the defence
of his empire. At first he was successful. Abdul-Mumin was compelled to
fall back on his mountain; but in a second action Tashufin was defeated; in
a third he was also compelled to retreat. Ali saw that his only hope of safety
lay in an escape to Spain. One night he resolved to make a desperate effort
to gain the port where his vessels were still riding at anchor. Unfortunately
either he mistook his way or his mule was terrified by the roaring of the
waves, for the next morning his
mangled corpse was found at the
foot of a precipice on the beach.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arab Soldier</span></p>
</div>

<p>But Morocco, Fez, and some
other cities were yet in the power
of the Almoravids, who raised
Ibrahim Abu Ishak, son of Tashufin,
to the throne. The vindictive
Abdul-Mumin, however, left them
little time to breathe. Tlemcen he
took by assault, and massacred the
inhabitants; Fez he also reduced.
The siege of Morocco was prosecuted
with vigour. The inhabitants
were so fatally repulsed in a
sortie that they durst no longer
venture outside the walls. Famine
soon aided the sword; the number
who died of starvation is said
to have amounted to three-fourths
of the whole population. Such a
place could not long hold out; and
accordingly it was carried in the
first general assault. Ibrahim and
the surviving sheikhs were instantly
brought before the conqueror.
Not only were he and his
chiefs led out to instant execution,
but a general massacre of the surviving
inhabitants was ordered.
The few who were spared were
sold as slaves; the mosques were destroyed
and new ones erected; and
the tribes of the desert were called
to re-people the now solitary streets.</p>

<p>During these memorable exploits in Africa, the Christians were rapidly
increasing their dominions. Coria, Mora, etc., were in the power of Alfonso,
styled the emperor; and almost every contest between the two natural enemies
had turned to the advantage of the Christians. So long, indeed, as the
walis were eager only to preserve or to extend their authority, independent
of each other and of every superior, this success need not surprise us; we
may rather be surprised that the Mohammedans were allowed to retain any
footing in the peninsula. Probably they would at this time have been
driven from it but for the seasonable arrival of the victorious Almohads.
Both Christians and Africans now contended for the superiority. While the
troops of Alfonso reduced Baeza, and with a Mohammedan ally even Cordova,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Malaga and Seville acknowledged Abu Amram. Calatrava and Almeria
next fell to the Christian emperor, about the same time that Lisbon and the
neighbouring towns received Dom Henry (Henrique), the new sovereign of
Portugal. Most of these conquests, however, were subsequently recovered
by the Almohads. Being reinforced by a new army from Africa, the latter
pursued their successes with greater vigour. They reduced Cordova, which
was held by an ally of Alfonso; defeated, and forever paralysed, the expiring
efforts of the Almoravids; and proclaimed their emperor Abdul-Mumin
as sovereign of all Mohammedan Spain (1146).</p>

<h4>DYNASTY OF THE ALMOHADS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1145-1198 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Abdul-Mumin, as if desirous of subduing not merely what had formed
the empire of the Almoravids but all the regions which owned the faith of
Islam, levied army after army; so that from Portugal to Tunis and Kairwan
his wild hordes spread devastation and dismay. To detail the events
of the wars sustained by his general, or his son the cid Yusuf, in Andalusia,
would afford little interest to the reader. It will be sufficient to observe
that, by slow but sure degrees, the whole of Andalusia was incorporated
with his empire. Once only did he visit Spain, if remaining a few hours at
Gibraltar can deserve the name. In 1162 he breathed his last. On his
accession, Yusuf Abu Yakub dismissed the enormous army which had been
collected. During the following few years he appears to have cultivated
the blessings of peace; it was not until 1170 that he entered Spain, and all
Mohammedan Spain owned the emperor.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the destructive wars which had prevailed near a century,
neither Moors nor Christians had acquired much advantage by them.
From the reduction of Saragossa to the present time, the victory, indeed,
had generally declared for the Christians; but their conquests, with the exception
of Lisbon and a few fortresses in central Spain, were lost almost as
soon as gained; and the same fate attended the equally transient successes
of the Mohammedans. The reason why the former did not permanently
extend their territories, was their internal dissensions. The Christians,
when at peace among themselves, were always too many for their Mohammedan
neighbours, even when the latter were aided by the whole power of
western Africa.</p>

<p>Yakub ben Yusuf, from his victories afterwards named Al-Mansur, was
declared successor to his father. For some years he was not personally
opposed to the Christians, though his walis carried on a desultory indecisive
war. In 1194 he landed in Andalusia, and proceeded towards Valencia,
where the Christian army then lay. There Alfonso VIII, king of Castile,
was awaiting the expected reinforcements from his allies, the kings of Leon
and Navarre. Both armies pitched their tents on the plains of Alarcon.
The chiefs of both naturally felt anxious for the result; but the charge of
rashness cannot be erased from the memory of Alfonso, for venturing to
withstand alone a conflict with the overwhelming force of the enemy, instead
of falling back to effect a junction with his allies. His loss must have been
immense, amounting probably to twenty thousand men. With a generosity
very rare in a Mohammedan, and still more in an African, Yakub restored
his prisoners to liberty&mdash;an action for which, we are informed, he received
few thanks from his followers. After this signal victory Yakub rapidly
reduced Calatrava, Guadalaxara, Madrid and Esalona, Salamanca, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Toledo, too, he invested, but in vain. He returned to Africa, caused his son
Muhammed to be declared wali alhadi, and died (1199). He was, beyond
doubt, the greatest and best of the Almohads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1198-1212 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The character of Muhammed Abu Abdallah, surnamed An-Nasir, was very
different from that of his great father. Much as the world had been astounded
at the preparations of his grandfather Yusuf, they were not surpassed by his
own, if, as we are credibly informed, one alone of the five divisions of his army
amounted to 160,000 men. It is certain that a year was required for the
assembling of this vast armament, that two months were necessary to convey
it across the straits, and that all Christian Europe was filled with alarm
at its disembarkation. Innocent III proclaimed a crusade to Spain; and
Rodrigo of Toledo, the celebrated historian, accompanied by several prelates,
went from one court to another to rouse the Christian princes. While the
kings of Aragon and Navarre promised to unite their forces with their
brother of Castile to repel the common danger, great numbers of volunteers
from Portugal and southern France hastened to the general rendezvous at
Toledo, the pope ordered fasting, prayers, and processions to be made, to propitiate
the favour of heaven, and to avert from Christendom the greatest
danger that had threatened it since the days of the emir Abd ar-Rahman.</p>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF LAS NAVAS DE TOLOSA (1212 A.D.)</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1212-1270 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Muhammed opened the campaign by the siege of Salvatierra, a strong but
not important fortress of Estremadura, defended by the knights of Calatrava.
That he should waste his forces on objects so incommensurate with their
extent, proves how little he was qualified to wield them. The place stood
out for several months, and did not surrender until the emperor had sustained
a heavy loss, nor until the season was too far advanced to permit any advantage
to be derived from this partial success. By suspending the execution
of his great design until the following season, he allowed Alfonso time to
prepare for the contest. The following June, the kings of Leon and Castile
having assembled at Toledo, and been joined by a considerable number of
foreign volunteers, the Christian army advanced towards the south.</p>

<p>On July 12th, the crusaders reached the mountainous chain which divides
New Castile from Andalusia. They found not only the passes, but the summits
of the mountains occupied by the Almohads. To force a passage was
impossible; and they even deliberated on retreating, so as to draw out, if
possible, the enemy from positions so formidable, when a shepherd entered
the camp of Alfonso, and proposed to conduct the Christian army, by a path
unknown to both armies, to the summit of this elevated chain&mdash;by a path,
too, which would be invisible to the enemy’s outposts. A few companies
having accompanied the man, and found him equally faithful and well
informed, the whole army silently ascended, and entrenched themselves on
the summit, the level of which was extensive enough to contain them all.
Below appeared the widespread tents of the Moslems, whose surprise was
great on perceiving the heights thus occupied by the crusaders. For two
days the latter, whose fatigues had been harassing, kept their position; but on
the third day they descended into the plains of Tolosa, which were about to be
immortalised by their valour. Their right wing was led by the king of Navarre,
their left by the king of Aragon, while Alfonso took his station in the centre.
The attack was made by the Christian centre against that of the Mohammedans;
and immediately the two wings moved against those of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>The struggle was terrific, but short; myriads of the barbarians fell, the
boundary was first broken down by the king of Navarre, the Castilians and
Aragonese followed, all opponents were massacred or fled, and the victors
began to ascend the eminence on which Muhammed still remained. Muhammed
mounted a mule and soon outstripped not only the pursuers but the
fugitives. The carnage of the latter was dreadful, until darkness put an end
to it. The victors now occupied the tents of the Mohammedans, while the
two martial prelates sounded the <i>Te Deum</i> for the most splendid success
which had shone on the banners of the Christians since the time of Charles
Martel. The loss of the Africans, even according to the Arabian writers,
who admit that the centre was wholly destroyed, could not fall short of
160,000 men.</p>

<p>The reduction of several towns, from Tolosa to Baeza, immediately followed
this glorious victory&mdash;a victory in which Don Alfonso nobly redeemed his
failure in the field of Zallaka, and which, in its immediate consequences,
involved the ruin of the Mohammedan empire in Spain. After an unsuccessful
attempt on Ubeda, as the hot season was raging, the allies returned to
Toledo, satisfied that the power of Muhammed was forever broken. That
emperor, indeed, did not long survive his disaster. Having precipitately
fled to Morocco, he abandoned himself to licentious pleasures, left the cares of
government to his son, or rather his ministers, and died in 1213, not without
suspicion of poison.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_9c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_9c">c</a></span></p>

<h4>THE DECLINE OF ARAB POWER</h4>

<p>After the dissolution of the Almohad empire Africa and Spain, without
severing any of the ties that bound their populations together, ceased forever
to obey the same government. This separation would have had no disastrous
consequences for Islam if the tribes of Maghreb had not set so high a price
upon their assistance that the Spanish Arabs were unable to accept it. The
Maghrebites did indeed cross the strait several times after 1232, but these
expeditions served merely to assure the triumphs of the Christians, who drew
together in closer and closer union.</p>

<p>The defeat of Tolosa had, by demonstrating the incapacity of Muhammed
an-Nasir, precipitated the insurrection of Andalusia; and in Africa the power
founded by Abdul-Mumin was as rapidly declining, owing to the failure of
the Almohad princes to display the necessary decision and address. As early
as 1242 the wali of Tunis refused to renew the tribute which as vassal he was
bound to pay, caused himself to be proclaimed an independent sovereign, and
founded on the most solid basis the dynasty of the house of Abu Hass, which
was destined to endure through several centuries. Farther to the west, in
1248, the Beni Zian family established their supremacy at Tlemcen, Algiers,
and in the neighbourhood of Fez; while in the Maghreb the tribe of Beni
Merin raised the standard of revolt and menaced Fez, Tasa, and Morocco.
For twenty years the Almohads held their ground against their enemies; but
all the courage they displayed was rendered useless by their own intestine
strife, and in 1270 the Merinid, Abu Yusuf, received the allegiance of the
Arabian Moors, or Berbers, of western Africa.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to-day to determine exactly the extent of the territories
controlled by the revolting tribes, but in the beginning their domains,
without doubt, included Bougie and Algiers and extended from Tlemcen to
the Atlantic. Their frontier lines must, in any case, have been constantly
changing, as the rulers of the three states waged incessant war against each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
other, and emigration and displacements were continually taking place. A
chronological list of the princes who succeeded each other at Tunis, Tlemcen,
and Morocco, during the period that extended from the thirteenth to the
sixteenth century, would teach us little of an epoch concerning which very
few documents exist. The most we know is that the cities of Tunis, Bougie,
Algiers, Tlemcen, Fez, and Morocco retained under the Abu Hass, the Beni
Zian, and the Beni Merin the importance and splendour that had been theirs
under the Zairites and the Omayyads, and could still cite with pride the
names of many great artists and scholars. The ancient maritime power of
the Aghlabites had fallen never to rise again; but bands of pirates were
organised which inflicted great damage
on Christians, and vessels leaving
the Atlantic ports began to
descend the coasts of Africa to the
tropics, where they carried on a
great trade in gold, amber, and
negro slaves.</p>

<p>Naturally the Arabs were drawn
into all the disputes that arose between
the different sovereigns of
Africa, but they experienced no
serious results from any of them.
Once in 1347, and again in 1359,
the Merinid chiefs had succeeded in
overcoming Tlemcen and Tunis;
but the deposed rulers soon recovered
their thrones and continued to
reign over the populations they had
trained to obedience. Of the three
African dynasties that of Abu Hass
experienced the fewest turmoils and
disorders. While in Maghreb two
rivals of equal force disputed for
supremacy over the capitals of Fez
and Morocco, and in Tlemcen the
Beni Zian were obliged to resist the
encroachments of formidable neighbours,
the kings in Tunis were
powerful enough to command the
respect of all other cities near, and
to wrest Tripoli from the warlike
mamelukes of Egypt, the rulers who had succeeded to the Eyyubid sultans.</p>

<p>Having apparently accomplished their mission, the Arabs no longer sought
to make the cause of Islam triumph, but little by little withdrew to the
obscurity and monotony of a desert life. Even in 1270, at the time of the last
crusade of St. Louis, they displayed nothing like the courage that had characterised
them on former occasions, being content to sign a disadvantageous
treaty with Charles of Anjou, by which they bound themselves to receive
French and Italian merchandise free of duty, and to permit the free practice
of Catholicism throughout their states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1343-1534 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Later the Spaniards and the Portuguese conquered the African cities
which command the Straits of Gibraltar, and sent into the interior as many
troops as the Africans had formerly sent into Spain. When they had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
masters of Algeciras and Tarifa, the Portuguese, who first undertook these
enterprises, seized Alemtejo and Algarve and then decided to carry into
other countries that spirit of adventure which had led them to demand on
sea the wealth and power that were denied them on land. In 1415 they
took possession of Ceuta, which they had to defend against Edward, second
of the house of Braganza, but were finally able to retain by allowing to
remain in irons a child that they had delivered over as hostage. Between
1439-1481 Alfonso V conquered the important cities of Tangiers and
Arzillo. Nevertheless the Portuguese had little thought of extending their
conquests further, but were devoting themselves to commerce and navigation,
in the interests of which they made those maritime discoveries that were to
raise them so high among nations and send their ships into so many unknown
waters of the globe.</p>

<p>It has not been sufficiently pointed out how fatal to the Arabs of Spain
was the occupancy by the Portuguese of Tangiers, Ceuta, and Arzillo.
Hitherto the Moslems in Maghreb could come to the assistance of their
brothers in Spain without looking upon themselves as interested parties to
the dispute. But after the Portuguese came to command the strait, with
power to intercept all communications between the two continents, the last
blow to Mohammedan unity was struck by the Christian princes.</p>

<p>Once the Catholic sovereigns had become masters of the Mediterranean
ports of the peninsula, they enlarged their navy that the Moslem fleets might
be constantly held in check, and after the fall of the monarchy of Granada
they penetrated deep into Africa. In 1504 Diego of Cordova took several
places between Ceuta and Oran, and in 1509 Cardinal Ximenes, minister to
Ferdinand of Aragon, organised and directed a much more important expedition.
Instead of attacking the younger branch of the Merinids at Morocco,
he advanced on Tlemcen and Algiers, the double realm of the Beni Zian, and
taking the city of Oran established there a strong garrison.</p>

<p>These encroachments on the part of Christians must be stopped at any
cost. Meeting with nothing but supineness and indifference among the
Moors and Arabs whom he approached, Eutemi, king of Algiers, finally
implored the assistance of Horuj, the celebrated pirate of Mytilene, who was
at the head of a considerable fleet. Accepting these overtures with alacrity,
Horuj repaired to Algiers with a force of five thousand men (1516); but
after entering the city he caused Eutemi to be assassinated, and himself
usurped the government. He further profited by the terror he had caused
to attack Tlemcen and drive forth the Beni Zian; but in 1518 the Spaniards
engaged him in a battle in which he lost his life, leaving Tlemcen in the
hands of his enemies.</p>

<p>In no wise discouraged by this reverse, the brother of Horuj, Khair ad-Din,
better known under the name of Barbarossa, succeeded in getting himself
acknowledged ruler by the inhabitants of Algiers and establishing his dominion
on solid foundations throughout the country; he drove the Spaniards
back into Oran, where he kept them confined. Fear, nevertheless, of the
superior numbers of the Christians and the mutability of the Arab spirit
caused him to seek for his states the protection of the supreme ruler who,
at his request, sent him troops of Turkish militia from Constantinople.
Barbarossa then took the title of regent, and in the name of the Ottoman
sultan exercised the highest authority over all the states of Algiers.</p>

<p>We have witnessed in Asia the gradual substitution of the Turks for the
Arabs as defenders of the Moslem faith; and we shall now assist at a repetition
of the same process in Africa. This was, too, the epoch of greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
power of the sultans in Constantinople. Suleiman, master of Egypt, of
Asia Minor, of Greece, and Bulgaria, threatened simultaneously Persia and
Hungary, and he alone was capable of protecting Africa against the redoubtable
might of Charles V. Far from injuring the cause of Islam, the arrival of
these new auxiliaries in the Maghreb should have given it a fresh impetus; but
exactly the reverse took place. From the day the Arabs came under subjection
to the Turks, all the noble sentiments and generous impulses that had
before characterised them gave place to a hopeless condition of servility and
degradation; bowed under the yoke of an insolent military body that enforced
obedience at the point of the sword, they lost that natural pride that had set
them apart from other races, and little by little fell into the brutish torpor
that has been their prevailing state in modern times, and which has caused
us to judge them wrongfully as showing antagonism to all ideas of civilisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1534-1541 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Turks had sway not only over Algiers but over Tunis and Tripoli,
and it was to Barbarossa that they owed these further triumphs. Placed by
Suleiman in command of the Ottoman fleet, the brother of Horuj thought it
necessary to repay this distinction by brilliant services. Having given
refuge in Algiers to a deposed prince of the house of Abu Hass, Barbarossa
presented himself at Tunis, ostensibly for the purpose of re-establishing its
legitimate ruler, but in reality to pave the way for Ottoman dominion.
Suleiman, acquainted with his designs, publicly conferred the investiture
on the restored prince, who was immediately afterward spirited away: and
Barbarossa seized the fort and town of Goletta, and put down the revolt of
the inhabitants in the name of the Ottoman ruler, to whom they remained
long under subjection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Christian sovereigns looked on with anxiety while the capitals
of the Barbary states were passing into the possession of a power already so
formidable; and Charles V, king of Spain and emperor of Germany, determined
to check at once the increase of Ottoman dominion. Taking sides
with the Abu Hass he embarked in 1535 with troops gathered from the
Netherlands, Italy, and Sicily, and landed not far from the ruins of Carthage.
Barbarossa had been able to provision the fort of Goletta, but could not rally
to his standard the Arab tribes; and Goletta, bravely defended by Sinan, the
renegade Jew, was taken by the Christian forces. Tunis itself, Barbarossa
being defeated, was forced to open its doors to the victors, and all its riches
became the prey of the European soldiers. The prince of the house of Abu
Hass, whose interests Charles V had espoused, was reinstated on the throne
under the following conditions: (1) that he was to hold the kingdom of
Tunis as a fief to the crown of Spain; (2) that all Christian slaves should
be restored to liberty without ransom; (3) that the subjects of the emperor
in his domain should be free to engage in commerce and practise the Christian
religion; (4) that twelve thousand crowns should be contributed towards
the maintenance of a Spanish garrison in Goletta; and (5) that all the ports
of the kingdom of Tunis should be delivered over into the hands of the
emperor. Brilliant as was this expedition, it did not completely destroy
African piracy, Algiers having been left still undisturbed. Barbarossa’s
successor, Hassan Aga, committed new depredations, and soon intercepted
all the commerce of the Mediterranean Sea. It became necessary to establish
guards along the coasts of Italy, Sicily, and Spain to keep off the incursions
of Barbary pirates who, it was asserted, were secretly encouraged by the
Arabs still residing on the continent. Charles V got together a new fleet
and undertook to reduce Algiers (1541). But the elements were against
him from the start, and being assailed at a propitious moment by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Algerian Turks and certain tribes of Arabs whose religious fanaticism had
been excited, the imperial army suffered complete and disastrous defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1541-1800 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This unfortunate enterprise also restored the preponderance to the Turks.
As soon as circumstances permitted they sent a fleet against the knights of St.
John whom Charles V had made masters of Tripoli and reconquered the state
in 1551. The government was given into the hands of the celebrated Dragut,
who ten years later in concert with Piali Pasha was to achieve another great
naval victory.</p>

<p>After the battle of Lepanto, John of Austria marched on Tunis, which
offered but a feeble resistance; hardly had he turned his back, however, on
the conquered domain, when Sinan Pasha hurried from Tripoli and everywhere
re-established the authority of the sultan. Henceforth the Turks
were masters over all Tunis and Algiers, and expeditions directed against
them had no longer any object save to demand reparation or to punish them
for acts of piracy.</p>

<p>Morocco, on the other hand, always remained independent of the Ottoman
rule. The Merinids were succeeded in the fifteenth century by the
Oatazes, who were in turn replaced by the Sherifs, whose dynasty continues
to this day. The adroit personages who had created the grandeur of
Morocco were looked upon as the legitimate descendants of Mohammed,
and to the brothers of the reigning king, not his children, fell the succession
to the throne. This law was the cause of much disturbance in the
state, and in 1578 it formed the pretext for a famous expedition directed
against Morocco by Dom Sebastian, king of Portugal. The sherif Abdallah
having died, his son, Mulei Muhammed, had at first had the advantage over
his uncle in the dispute for the succession; but being at last defeated
Muhammed betook himself to Portugal, where he hoped to persuade the
king, by the promise of large rewards, to assist him in gaining the crown.
Carried away by enthusiasm, Sebastian embarked; and having in his possession
the coat of arms worn by Charles V at his entry into Tunis, he imagined
that he should exceed all that emperor’s exploits, and perhaps place
the cross over the mosques of Morocco and Fez. He was taken at a disadvantage,
however, by the Arabs at Kasr al-Kebir, and he and his little troop
found themselves confronted by the dire alternative of achieving victory or
meeting death. In this supreme moment Sebastian’s courage did not desert
him; it served to make illustrious his defeat and dying moments. The
two competitors also perished the same day; one by drowning in the river
Mucazin, and the other as the result of a fever which he had disregarded in
the haste and ardour of his preparations. Made wise by this terrible experience,
the Portuguese did not renew their attempts against Africa, and the
sherifs had further only to repress the internal dissensions that so frequently
arose in their domains.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of the Arabs in Africa during the seventeenth
century. They had still a sort of preponderance in Morocco; but in
Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli the Turks had become masters of the cities of
the coast, and imposed upon them the severest rule. The different tribes,
armed against each other by the astute policy of their oppressors, and terrorised
by frequent and sanguinary executions, paid the tribute demanded
of them without daring to murmur, and never even dreamed of throwing off
the yoke under which they laboured.</p>

<p>We will return now to the Arabs in Spain, who had struck the first and
most damaging blow at the empire of the Almohads. In addition to the
garrisons the Africans placed among them, the populations had still to resist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
the domination of the Christians; and in order to effect this the most perfect
unity would have been necessary, with the complete sacrifice of all
private interests to the national welfare. But, as we have seen, instead of
possessing a strongly constituted central government, the Spanish Arabs
were divided up into a number of independent states, and the Catholic
princes took advantage of this dismemberment to separately overcome them.
James I, not content with the conquest of the Balearic Isles, undertook to
gain possession of Valencia, and in his enthusiasm for this project abstained
from urging against Thibaut de Champagne the rights his birth gave him
to the crown of Navarre, thus gaining for himself an ally in the person of
a prince who could furnish him with substantial aid. The king of Valencia
struggled hard to defend his possessions, but the disunion among the Moslems
and the bad faith of the walis, who for bribes delivered over to the
enemy all the cities adjacent to the capital, caused Valencia finally to be
invested both by land and by sea. Too feeble to resist longer, the Moslem
king invoked the aid of the other sovereigns of Africa, but all were too busy
with their own affairs, and Valencia fell into the hands of James (Jayme),
under conditions that enabled the inhabitants to leave in freedom, or to
remain with full protection for their property and religious liberty (1238).</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1238-1245 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Valencia conquered, James next sought to extend his dominion over the
kingdom of Murcia, but the king of Castile, by a powerful intervention
(1241), succeeded in turning him from all schemes of aggrandisement. The
kingdom of Murcia, less powerful than that of Valencia, was divided among
a great many different tribes whose chiefs, all jealous of each other’s authority,
hastened to submit to Ferdinand III under the best conditions they
could obtain. The wali of Lorca alone held out for independence; but two
years later his cities were also taken by assault, and the entire kingdom of
Murcia passed over to the crown of Castile.</p>

<p>Another acquisition of far greater importance had, moreover, been made
by this crown since 1232. In the coveted regions of Guadalquivir, Ibn Hud
had at first been able to take an energetic stand against Ferdinand III;
but lacking utterly the resources necessary for carrying on a protracted
struggle, he was at last obliged to surrender Ubeda and Andujar, and could
not prevent siege being laid to Cordova. The peril which threatened the
capital should have aroused the courage and ardour of the Moslems in its
defence, but nothing of the sort occurred; Ibn Hud was assassinated in the
midst of his preparations for resistance, and the city was obliged to capitulate.
Thus was extinguished the glory of the Islam metropolis in the West,
the city of arts and Moslem luxury and magnificence. Ferdinand III placed
the cross on the minarets of the great mosques, and returned to Compostella
the bells of St. James that Almansor had carried away as trophies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1245-1249 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The time had come for the Arabs to bid farewell to the memories of
their past triumphs and glories; they witnessed the profanation of all their
sanctuaries without venturing to make the supreme effort that might still
have saved them. Ferdinand’s victories now followed in quick succession.
After taking several cities he encountered and defeated, before Alcala, Muhammed
ben al-Akhmar, who had gotten himself acknowledged in the states
of Ibn Hud. The Moslems displayed great courage in this engagement; and
Ferdinand, after taking possession of the vast domain ceded to him by
Muhammed ben al-Akhmar, agreed to leave him in peace provided he
would pay him an annual tribute, furnish a certain number of troops in
case of war, and appear in person at the assemblies or <i>cortes</i> of Castile.
He reserved to himself the right of aggression against the Arabs of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
Algarve and Guadalquivir, who were still divided into many small states.
Seville, the ancient capital of the Almoravids and the Almohads, the capture
of which would forever prevent the union of the Algarve with the Sierra
Nevada Moslems, was suddenly invested, and in the camp of the enemy
were plainly to be seen Muhammed ben al-Akhmar and his five hundred
horsemen. The city resisted long, being in constant receipt of supplies from
Moslem sources by way of the Guadalquivir, and it was not until Ferdinand
III equipped a small fleet and surrounded the mouth of the Guadalquivir that
the inhabitants, threatened by famine, capitulated. The same favourable
terms were accorded to them as to the Arabs of Valencia (1248).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p254.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Spanish War Vessel, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries</span></p>
</div>

<p>Upon the taking of Seville ensued the submission of all the states lying
upon the right bank of the Guadalquivir; hence the complete downfall of the
Arab race could not be far distant. Yet the inevitable result was somewhat
retarded by Muhammed ben al-Akhmar, whose courage and ability reminded
the Arabs of the qualities of the famed Almansor, and who brought into being
a powerful Moslem state which for a while opposed a formidable barrier to the
spread of Christian influence. Granada, its capital, became soon the rallying-point
of the Moslems dispersed all over the country, and the beneficence of
this remarkable prince’s rule attracted to his states all who were not disposed
to accept the Spanish domination. Emigrants from Cordova and Seville
found a cordial welcome at Muhammed’s court, and their number was also
increased by the Moslem population which James expelled, in 1249, from the
plains about Valencia. It can readily be seen what an advantage to Granada
was the presence of all these active, intelligent inhabitants; the elements of
wealth and success that the Arabs had strewn all over the peninsula now
returned upon them in a single flood; and Islam, rising once more under the
astonished gaze of Spain, enjoyed a second period of glory (1238-1492).</p>

<p>The luxury and gallantry of the court of Granada have remained famous
to this day. Tourneys and jousts were given, and frequent bull-fights and
races. The people were often invited by the sovereign to solemn festivals
and splendid banquets, and all this opulence was by no means the result of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
oppression, but sprang naturally from the condition of ease which prevailed
among all classes. La Veja, the fertile plain which surrounds Granada, produced
in that day three times what it does in this, and could easily support
a considerable population. The manufacture of silks and other stuffs
attained the highest point of excellence, the fine arts were cultivated as successfully
as at Cordova, and to stimulate invention prizes were offered in every
department of endeavour. The names Alhambra and Generalif awaken in
the mind images of the greatest richness and splendour. The Alhambra was
at once the palace and fortress of the Moorish kings; Generalif was a magnificent
pleasure palace built near the Alhambra on the summit of a hill, and
serving as a summer residence for the nobles of the court.</p>

<p>Astronomy, medicine, chemistry, and mathematics were widely encouraged,
and from that period dates the discovery of gunpowder. In the
universities, which were restricted in their method of instruction, were
taught grammar, geography, dialectics, and an obscurely formulated system
of theology; also a great impulsion was given to the writing of those stories
and romances which, in spite of their numerous affectations, have so many
warm admirers to-day. In regard to political institutions the sovereigns of
Granada accomplished much that was too important to be passed by in silence.
In every city they established a sort of national guard by placing all the
citizens under arms; and in order that the frontiers might be more effectively
protected, soldiers were given grants of land on the borders, sufficient to maintain
themselves and their families. The price of the necessaries of life was
never allowed to rise beyond a certain point, and the kings themselves saw to
it that the markets were always well supplied.</p>

<p>All the details of life in the capital were strictly regulated, and a capital
police force patrolled the streets at night. Certain of the princes, following
the rigorous proscriptions of the <i>Koran</i>, prohibited the use of spirituous
liquors; but for the most part it was the abuse alone that was severely punished.
A successful effort was made to prevent Jews from practising usury
with as great freedom as elsewhere; and to avoid litigation and dispute,
public acts and private treaties were drawn up in terms of great clearness
and precision. Wise measures were adopted in all that pertained to the
practice of religion. The feasts of Ramadhan, instead of being set apart for
folly and debauchery, were made the occasion of good deeds and charity
toward the poor; and processions for the purpose of imploring rain were
prohibited, as also all nocturnal public gatherings. Imprisonment was substituted
for whipping in penal offences, and lapidation was completely
abolished; criminals condemned to death were still buried alive, as was
the law in all Moslem states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1275-1432 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Strong as was Granada’s claim to an honourable place in history, it had
no fixed laws of succession, and beside princes worthy of all admiration we
see cruel and incapable despots who precipitated the ruin of the Moslem
races. Muhammed ben al-Akhmar and Muhammed II (1273-1302) were
able to repress all attempts at disorder in their states, but Muhammed III
was not so fortunate. One of his brothers, Nasar Abul-Jinz, incited an insurrection
in Granada and got himself proclaimed king, only to be deposed
in his turn four years later by his nephew, Ismail ben Faraj. This prince
reigned twelve years and was succeeded by his two sons, Muhammed IV
(1325-1333) and Yusuf I (1333-1354). The latter was the author of many
of the reforms we have noted above, and was, without doubt, the most remarkable
of the rulers of Granada, notwithstanding the defeat he suffered
at Rio Salado at the hands of the Christians. At the death of Yusuf,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
Muhammed (V) Guadix, his son, was excluded from the throne by family
intrigues and jealousies, but finally mounted it in 1362 and reigned until
1391. The succession next fell to Yusuf II, and Muhammed VI, who condemned
his elder brother Yusuf to death. Yusuf was playing chess when
the executioner appeared before him; he asked and obtained leave to finish
the game; but before it was ended messengers from the court arrived with the
news that Muhammed VI was dead, and that he, Yusuf, was to ascend
the throne. Yusuf III (1408) retained the crown until 1423, when there
broke out all over the realm those civil dissensions that were to bring about
the fall of Granada, and in which the powerful families of the Zegris, the
Abencerrages, and the Vanegas played so prominent a part.</p>

<p>From the time of their accession to power the Castilians were the only
enemies the kings of Granada had to fear; hence they strove to conciliate them
by receiving them honourably at their court, or by arbitrating personally in
any disputes that might arise. But the differences in race and religion were
too great to allow of any real friendship being established, and the Castilians
were only withheld by their own internal troubles from carrying out further
the projects of Ferdinand III. If the princes of Granada had seized the
opportunity offered them by these disorders among the Castilians, the standard
of the prophet might yet have been raised in Spain; but the spirit of
conquest had completely abandoned them, and the warfare in which they were
engaged during a long period of time was confined to attacking a few places,
among which were Gibraltar, Tarifa, and Almeria. One last effort was made,
however, in 1275, by Muhammed II, who delivered over Tarifa and Algeciras
to Abu Yusuf, and together the two princes invaded Algarve. Sancho the
Brave was not intimidated, and successfully defended the interior of the country.
Later, when the states had awarded him the crown as a return for his
valour, his father, Alfonso X, begged aid of the king of Granada against his rebellious
son, and if the Arab ruler had yielded his subjects would have had
an excellent opportunity of penetrating to the heart of Castile. But Muhammed
II preferred, by entering an alliance with Sancho, to gain for himself the
friendship of a powerful warrior.</p>

<p>In 1308 the Castilians took Gibraltar and laid siege to Algeciras; to
induce them to raise the siege it was necessary to cede to them several cities.
During the minority of Alfonso XI two of the <i>infante</i> or regents of Castile
united their forces and made a hostile advance on Granada; but their ardour
made them neglect all prudence and they were completely defeated on the
spot that is called to this day the Sierra de los Infantes (1319). This victory
encouraged the king of Granada, who immediately sent out expeditions to
reconquer the places he had lost, even Gibraltar. The advantage might
have been pushed still further had the Africans supported Muhammed V,
but on the contrary they took from him Algeciras, Marbella, and Ronda.
It was not until the accession of Yusuf II that a genuine alliance united all
the Moslems under one banner. In concert with the Merinid prince, Abul-Hassan,
Yusuf attacked Tarifa; but the allied forces met with severe defeat
and Abul-Hassan, after surrendering all his possessions to Spain, went to
hide his shame in Fez (1340). His fleet was shortly afterward destroyed
by the European galleys which had united to assure the empire of the sea to
the Christians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1432-1491 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Henceforth the Arabs in Spain were thrown entirely on their own
resources, and situated as they were at the extremity of the peninsula, they
asked for nothing but to remain in complete obscurity. Not until 1432 was
war again resumed; at that time Yusuf IV and Muhammed VII disputed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
for the crown, and one of the two competitors implored aid of the Castilians,
who assisted him to victory. Now followed a series of isolated frontier-combats
caused by incursions of Castilian nobles and Arab sheikhs into one
another’s territory; but they brought about no general war, being, as it were,
preliminary jousts that served to prepare the public spirit for the supreme
struggle that was to come.</p>

<p>Granada was in no condition to resist the Castilians when Mulei Hassan
ascended the throne in 1466. Despite his courage and patriotism, that new
king was not received with favour by the people, who accused him of cruelty
and arrogance and resented the power he had allowed a Christian slave-woman
to gain over him; many even went so far as to assert that he would
name the son of this slave his successor, to the exclusion of Abu Abdallah
(Boabdil), the son of the sultana Zoraya. In Castile, on the contrary, the
nobles had united to form a faction around the infanta Isabella, who was
married to Ferdinand, king of Sicily, who was, moreover, the heir presumptive
to the crown of Aragon. Disposing of the revenues of three
kingdoms, the husband and wife were about to establish forever the unity and
power of Spain by destroying the Arab domination in the peninsula. Mulei
Hassan aroused their resentment by refusing to pay the tribute agreed to
by his father; he even carried hostilities to the point of attacking Zahara,
which he took in 1480. But the ruins of the conquered city were destined
to fall upon the heads of the victors; their own Alhama, the main support
of Granada, was taken by the Castilians, who shortly afterward advanced
upon the capital.</p>

<p>Here all was trouble, the partisans of Abu Abdallah having just deposed
Mulei Hassan, who abandoned by the most of his supporters was obliged to
retire to the provinces. The Castilians carried on the war for a while
longer, but without great energy; and when Abu Abdallah finally fell into
their hands they immediately restored him to liberty, thinking that his
culpable ambitions would serve them better than the most signal victory.
Mulei Hassan recovered the throne for a short time, but was forced to
abdicate in favour of his uncle, Az-Zagal. Abu Abdallah, who had incurred
the contempt of his compatriots, sought aid of Ferdinand; and that king
immediately invaded the kingdom of Granada, taking the cities of La Vega,
after which Az-Zagal delivered over to him Granada (1486). Ferdinand
had attained the object of his expedition; but instead of retiring he concluded
a new compact with Abdallah, which authorised him to pursue
Az-Zagal and take from him all the strongholds in which he might seek
refuge. Armed with this pretext he besieged and captured Malaga, then
directed his troops against Almeria, Baza, and Vera. Convinced that further
struggle was useless, Az-Zagal proposed a general capitulation to Spain.
Ferdinand accepted and displayed great generosity and moderation. In return
for all the states he delivered over, the Moslem king was to receive full
proprietary right over vast domains, and his subjects were to become subjects
of Castile, retaining all their property and liberties on payment of a tribute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1491-1525 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The greater number of the Arabs of Granada saw in this treaty the
assurance of future peace, and were willing to submit to the Christian
domination; but the orthodox Moslems flew to arms, and forcing Az-Zagal
to take flight in Africa they fortified Granada and determined to successfully
defend it or be buried under its ruins. The 9th of May, 1491, Ferdinand appeared
before the walls of the city at the head of eighty thousand men. The
ablest of the Arab generals had organised the defence; but despite that fact
and the bravery with which all the inhabitants, men, women, and children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
endured the hardships and horrors of a siege, Ferdinand and Isabella had
superior might on their side, as well as indomitable perseverance, and were
bound to succeed.</p>

<p>As a proof of her determination not to recede until her purpose had been
accomplished, Isabella built a town about Granada, which exists to this day
under the name of Santa Fé. Moats and entrenchments guarded the Spanish
camp from surprises in any direction, and Ferdinand occupied himself in
intercepting all communication from outside. The Moslems risked their
last chance of safety in a general battle which resulted in victory for the
Christians. Contrary to the advice of many sheikhs, who preferred death to
surrender, Abu Abdallah entered into negotiations with Ferdinand. The
treaty ran that Granada was to be given up at the end of two months, provided
reinforcements did not arrive by sea or land within that time. The
Arabs had made appeal to the sovereigns of Africa, and even to the sultan
of Constantinople, but none would undertake the risk of such an enterprise,
and Granada was forced to succumb.</p>

<p>Not wishing to remain in the country that had witnessed his ignominy
and disgrace, Abu Abdallah went to Africa to finish his days in the silence of
the deserts. The inhabitants of Granada withdrew to the inmost chambers
of their dwellings, and let the Christians take possession of their city, which
had the air of being completely deserted. The banner of Castile was flown
from the summit of the Alhambra, and the great mosque was straightway
decorated with the ornaments of the Catholic religion. There was not one
among the vanquished who raised a protesting voice at anything that took
place; they even seemed indifferent to the terms of surrender by which they
retained their personal liberty, their property, their religion, their usages,
and even their former legislative institutions. The fall of Granada seemed to
be the sentence of death of the whole Arab race, as indeed it did mark the
end of their domination in Spain, which had lasted 781 years (711-1492).</p>

<p>Ferdinand had no intention of faithfully carrying out the terms of the
contract; he possessed Granada&mdash;that was the end and aim of his ambition.
Accustomed as he was in politics to sacrificing everything to his own interests,
he determined to force the Arabs gradually to abjure their religion and mode
of life until they became merged into the rest of the population. He went
prudently to work by charging his inquisitioners to convert the Moslems to
Catholicism only by degrees. The Jews were first to be attacked, and
forced by tortures and horrible executions to deny the faith of their fathers,
that the Arabs might see what fate was in store for them should they refuse
allegiance to Christianity. A little later all Moslem religious exercises were
prohibited in public, and in 1499 Ferdinand boldly threw aside the mask, and
pronounced sentence of expulsion against any Moslems who should refuse to
be baptised. In vain were the cries of indignation that arose in the kingdom
of Granada; the inhabitants of the cities went to church to worship
the Christian God, and then in the privacy of their own homes asked pardon
of the prophet for the sacrilege they had committed. The mountaineers of
Alpujarras, the most energetic among the Moslem populations, openly refused
to obey, and took up arms; but Ferdinand marched upon them with a superior
force, and after having devastated their lands added confiscation to the sentence
of exile pronounced against them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1525-1609 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Moslems of Valencia, whose industries formed one of Spain’s principal
sources of prosperity, were tolerated as late as the reign of Charles V.
During that period the nobles of the country forced them to submit to baptism.
In 1525 an edict, instigated by the archbishop of Seville who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
grand inquisitor, called upon the Arabs of Seville to renounce immediately
their customs, language, and style of dress. In 1565 the Moslems attempted to
gain some amelioration of these hard conditions by paying Philip II the sum
of eight hundred thousand ducats; but though the government and the inquisition
relaxed their severity in some degree, the Spanish people, carrying
intolerance to its highest limits, pursued even into their mountain fastnesses
the unfortunate Arabs who refused to become converted.</p>

<p>In 1568 the few faithful Moslems who were left armed themselves for
revolt and entered into relations with their co-religionists in Africa, hoping
to surprise and take Granada. Under the leadership of Muhammed ben
Omayyah, who claimed to descend from the Cordovan caliphs, the struggle
was carried on for several years; but finally divisions arose in the rebel camp,
and Muhammed was assassinated. Mulei Abdallah who succeeded him was
outwitted by John of Austria, and most of his soldiers deserted him&mdash;some
to submit to the Christian rule, others to be transported to Africa. Mulei
himself was reduced to negotiating terms with his victor. The mountaineers
of Alpujarras were dispersed through the provinces of Asturias, Galicia,
and Castile, and there kept under close surveillance.</p>

<p>A last blow was dealt the Arabs in 1609. Despite the protestations of
a few generous nobles, the Moslem populations of Murcia and Valencia were
crowded, by order of Philip III, on transports which carried them to the
shores of Africa. A great many passed over into the Pyrenees, where they
were received with kindness by Henry IV; this generous king offered many
of them a refuge in his own domains, and to others he gave means of embarking
for the ports of Guienne and Languedoc. It has been calculated that,
from the time of the conquest of Granada until 1609, three millions of Arabs
were exiled from Spanish soil; and never have the plains of Valencia,
Murcia, and Granada recovered the flourishing aspect that they wore when
cultivated by their former masters. The decree of 1609 was as fatal to
Spain as the revocation of the Edict of Nantes was to France nearly a hundred
years later.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_9d"><a href="#parthians_endnote_9d">d</a></span></p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X. ARAB CIVILISATION</h3>

<h4>THE <i>KORAN</i></h4>

<p>The <i>Koran</i> is held by the Mohammedans in the greatest veneration.
The book must not be touched by anybody but a Moslem; nor even by a
believer, except he be free from pollution. Whether the <i>Koran</i> be created
or uncreated, has been the subject of a controversy fruitful of the most
violent persecutions. The orthodox opinion is that the original has been
written from all eternity on the preserved table. Of this, they believe, a
complete transcript was brought down to the lower heaven (that of the
moon) by the angel Gabriel: and thence taken and shown to Mohammed
once every year of his mission; and twice in the last year of his life. They
assert however that it was only piecemeal, that the several parts were
revealed by the angel to the prophet, and that he immediately dictated what
had been revealed to his secretary, who wrote it down. Each part, as soon
as it was thus copied out, was communicated to his disciples, to get by heart;
and was afterwards deposited in what he called the chest of his apostleship.
This chest the prophet left in the custody of his wife Hafsa. The present
book was compiled, partly out of these detached scraps, and partly out of
the memories of his companions.</p>

<p>When we consider the way in which the <i>Koran</i> was compiled, we cannot
wonder that it is so incoherent a piece as we find it; the book is divided
into chapters; of these some are very long; others again, especially a few
towards the end, very short. Each chapter has a title prefixed, taken from
the first word, or from some one particular thing mentioned in it, rarely
from the subject-matter of it; for if a chapter be of any length, it usually
runs into various subjects that have no connection with each other. A celebrated
commentator divides the contents of the <i>Koran</i> into three general
heads: (1) Precepts or directions, relating either to religion, as prayers, fasting,
pilgrimages; or to civil polity, as marriages, inheritances, judicatures.
(2) Histories&mdash;whereof some are taken from the Scriptures, but falsified
with fabulous additions; others are wholly false, having no foundation in
fact. (3) Admonitions: under which head are comprised exhortations to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
receive Islamism; to fight for it, to practise its precepts, prayer, alms, etc.;
the moral duties, such as justice, temperance, etc., promises of everlasting
felicity to the obedient, dissuasives from sin, threatenings of the punishments
of hell to the unbelieving and disobedient. Many of the threatenings
are levelled against particular persons, and those sometimes of Mohammed’s
own family, who had opposed him in propagating his religion.</p>

<p>In the <i>Koran</i>, God is brought in, saying, “We have given you a book.”
By this it appears that the impostor published early, in writing, some of
his principal doctrines, as also some of his historical relations. Thus, in his
<i>Life</i>, p. 16, we find his disciples reading the twentieth chapter of the <i>Koran</i>
before his flight from Mecca; after which he pretended many of the revelations
in other chapters were brought to him. Undoubtedly, all those said to
be revealed at Medina must be posterior to what he had then published at
Mecca; because he had not yet been at Medina. Many parts of the <i>Koran</i>
he declared were brought to him by the angel Gabriel, on special occasions.
Accordingly, the commentators on the <i>Koran</i> often explain passages in it by
relating the occasion on which they were first revealed. Without such a
key, many of them would be perfectly unintelligible.</p>

<p>There are several contradictions in the <i>Koran</i>. To reconcile these, the
Moslem doctors have invented the doctrine of abrogation&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that what
was revealed at one time was revoked by a new revelation. A great deal
of it is so absurd, trifling, and full of tautology, that it requires no little
patience to read much of it at a time. Notwithstanding, the <i>Koran</i> is cried
up by the Mussulmans as inimitable. Accordingly, when Mohammed was
called upon, as he often was, to work miracles in proof of his divine mission,
he excused himself by various pretences, and appealed to the <i>Koran</i> as a
standing miracle. Each chapter of the <i>Koran</i> is divided into verses, that is,
lines of different length, terminated with the same letter, so as to make a
different rhyme, but without any regard to the measure of the syllables.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan religion consists of two parts, faith and practice.
Faith they divide into six articles: (1) A belief in the unity of God, in
opposition to those whom they call associators; by which name they mean
not only those who, besides the true God, worship idols or inferior gods or
goddesses, but the Christians also, who hold Christ’s divinity and the
doctrine of the Trinity. (2) A belief in angels, to whom they attribute
various shapes, names, and offices, borrowed from the Jews and Persians.
(3) The Scriptures. (4) The prophets; on this head the <i>Koran</i> teaches
that God revealed his will to various prophets, in divers ages of the world,
and gave it in writing to Adam, Seth, Enoch, Abraham, etc.; but these
books are lost; that afterwards he gave the Pentateuch to Moses, the Psalms
to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and the <i>Koran</i> to Mohammed. The <i>Koran</i>
speaks with great reverence of Moses and Jesus, but says the Scriptures left
by them have been greatly mutilated and corrupted. Under this pretence,
it adds a great many fabulous relations to the history contained in those
sacred books, and charges the Jews and Christians with suppressing many
prophecies concerning Mohammed (a calumny easily refuted, the Scriptures
having been translated into various languages, long before Mohammed was
born). (5) The fifth article of belief is the resurrection and day of judgment,
while about the intermediate state Mohammedan divines have various
opinions. The happiness promised to the Moslems in paradise is wholly
sensual, consisting of fine gardens, rich furniture, sparkling with gems and
gold, delicious fruits, and wines that neither cloy nor intoxicate; but above
all, affording the fruition of all the delights of love in the society of women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
having large black eyes, and every trait of exquisite beauty, who shall ever
continue young and perfect. Some of their writers speak of these females
of paradise in very lofty strains; telling us, for instance, that if one of them
were to look down from heaven in the night, she would illuminate the earth
as the sun does; and if she did but spit into the ocean, it would be immediately
turned as sweet as honey. These delights of paradise were certainly, at
first, understood literally; however, Mohammedan divines may have since
allegorised them into a spiritual sense. As to the punishments threatened
to the wicked, they are hell-fire, breathing hot winds, the drinking of boiling
and stinking water, eating briers and thorns, and the bitter fruit of the tree
Zakum, which in their bellies will feel like boiling pitch. These punishments
are to be everlasting to all except those who embrace Islamism; for
the latter, after suffering a number of years, in proportion to their demerits,
will then, if they have had but so much faith as is equal to the weight of an
ant, be released by the mercy of God, and, upon the intercession of Mohammed,
admitted into paradise.</p>

<p>The sixth article of belief is that God decrees everything that is to happen,
not only all events, but the actions and thoughts of men, their belief or
infidelity; that everything that has or will come to pass has been, from
eternity, written in the preserved or secret table, which is a white stone of
an immense size, preserved in heaven, near the throne of God. Agreeable
to this notion, one of their poets thus expresses himself: “Whatever is
written against thee will come to pass, what is written for thee shall not fail;
resign thyself to God, and know thy Lord to be powerful, his decrees will
certainly take place; his servants ought to be silent.”</p>

<p>Of their four fundamental points of practice, the first is prayer. This
duty is to be performed five times in the twenty-four hours: (1) In the morning
before sunrise; (2) when noon is past; (3) a little before sunset; (4)
a little after sunset; (5) before the first watch of the night. Previous to
prayer they are to purify themselves by washing. Some kinds of pollution
require the whole body to be immersed in water, but commonly it is enough
to wash some parts only, the head, the face and neck, hands and feet. In
the latter ablution, called <i>wodhu</i>, fine sand or dust may be used when water
cannot be had; in such case, the palm of the hand being first laid upon the
sand, is then to be drawn over the part required to be washed. The
Mohammedans, out of respect to the divine Majesty before whom they are
to appear, are required to be clean and decent when they go to public
prayers in their mosques; but are yet forbidden to appear there in sumptuous
apparel, particularly clothes trimmed with gold or silver, lest they
should make them vain and arrogant. The women are not allowed to be
in their mosques at the same time with the men; this they think would
make their thoughts wander from their proper business there. On this
account they reproach the Christians with the impropriety of the contrary
usage.</p>

<p>The next point of practice is alms-giving, which is frequently enjoined in
the <i>Koran</i>, and looked upon as highly meritorious. Many of them have been
very exemplary in the performance of this duty. The third point of practical
religion is fasting the whole month Ramadhan, during which they are every
day to abstain from eating, or drinking, or touching a woman, from daybreak
to sunset; after that they are at liberty to enjoy themselves as at
other times. From this fast an exception is made in favour of old persons
and children; those also that are sick, or on a journey; and women pregnant
or nursing are also excused in this month. But then, the person making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
use of this dispensation must expiate the omission by fasting an equal
number of days in some other month, and by giving alms to the poor.
There are also some other days of fasting, which are, by the more religious,
observed in the manner above described. The last practical duty is going
the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every man who is able is obliged to perform
once in his life. In the ceremonies of it they strictly copy those observed
by Mohammed. A pilgrimage can be made only in the month of Dhul-Hija;
but a visitation to Mecca may be made at any other time of the year.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10b"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10b">b</a></span></p>

<h4>DOZY’S ESTIMATE OF THE <i>KORAN</i></h4>

<p>The book which contains the revelations made to Mohammed, and which
is, at the same time, if not the most complete, at least the most trustworthy
source of his biography, presents more peculiarities and irregularities than
any other. It is a collection of stories, exhortations, laws, etc., placed side
by side without attempt at chronological order or any other order. The
revelations were seldom long, most frequently they consist of simple verses
which were put into writing in Mohammed’s life-time, or simply entrusted to
memory; for, as is proved by the genealogies and poems of paganism, which
for long were only preserved by oral tradition, Mohammed’s contemporaries
had a memory of marvellous power, as is generally the case with people who
write little. Mohammed called every complete revelation <i>sura</i>, or “<i>koran</i>.”
The former of these two words is Hebrew, and it literally means a series of
stones in a wall, and thence the line of a letter or of a book; in the <i>Koran</i>,
as we possess it, it has the wider meaning of a chapter. The word <i>koran</i>,
properly speaking, is an infinitive, and means “to read, to recite, to expose”;
this word is also borrowed from the Jews, who use the verb <i>kara</i> (to read)
especially in the sense of to study the Scriptures; but Mohammed himself
included under the name <i>Koran</i> not only each separate revelation, but also
the union of several or even of all of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p263.jpg" width="500" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Specimen of Arabic Writing</span></p>
<p class="caption">(From an old manuscript of the <i>Koran</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>However, in the time of Mohammed no complete collection of the texts
of the <i>Koran</i> existed; and had it not been for the care of the first three
caliphs it would have run a great risk of being forgotten. What reserves
are needed in admitting the entire authenticity of the text of the sacred
writings of the East! The example of the Jews shows this clearly. Already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
in the time of Mohammed it was known that the Jews had altered the text
of the Old Testament in several places; they have been blamed for doing so,
and the fact has been positively proved; at the same time in the history of
Judaism itself reasons have been discovered for these alterations, which from
a certain point of view appear necessary. The Mohammedans had not the
same reason as the Jews for adding and altering; but that does not prove
that they had no other reasons.</p>

<p>However that may be, and whatever may be the judgment which posterity
will declare as to the greater or lesser authenticity of the <i>Koran</i>, it is
quite certain that the arrangement of this book and its division into <i>suras</i>
or chapters is entirely arbitrary. And it could not be otherwise; an arrangement
according to subject was quite impossible, for Mohammed often spoke
in the same revelation of totally different things. Still less could a chronological
order be followed: first, because Mohammed himself, in many places, added
new revelations to more ancient ones; next, because in those times there was no
one still living who knew the exact moment when each verse had been revealed.
It was with perfect justice that, at this period, a man who was asked if the
fragments of the <i>Koran</i> were arranged in chronological order, replied:
“Even if all men and all <i>jinns</i> (demons) attempted it, they could not succeed.”
So the length of the <i>suras</i> was taken as a rule of the order to be followed,
without keeping too strictly to it; the longest came first, then the one
which was nearest in length, and so on; so that the last <i>sura</i> is at the
same time the shortest. The consequence is that revelations dating from
very different epochs are now mixed without order, so that a similar confusion
is found in no other book; and this, above all else, makes the reading
of the <i>Koran</i> so difficult and so tedious.</p>

<p>For believing Moslems the <i>Koran</i>, that is to say God’s Word which has
not been created, is the most perfect book which exists, both in matter and
form, and this opinion is what it should be in the natural order of things;
but it is somewhat strange that the prejudice of the Moslems should have
had more influence on us than would have been expected. The pompous
rhetoric and the so frequently foolish accumulation of metaphors which are
to be found in the Meccan <i>suras</i> have been taken seriously for poetry and
admired in consequence; the style of the whole book has been considered
a model of purity of language. It is difficult to argue on the question of
taste; every man has his private opinion on this matter, and he can seldom
be persuaded to change it. But if we must give our own, we must confess
that, among the more famous of ancient Arab books, we know none so
wanting in taste and originality, so exceedingly prolix and wearisome as
the <i>Koran</i>.</p>

<p>Mohammed was not able to compose in verse, an art of which nearly all
were masters at that time; so he did not speak in verse, and he even had a
marked aversion for poetry. His taste was extremely peculiar; he preferred
very mediocre poets who could express pious thoughts in bombastic verse,
to the greatest Arab poets who were still living or who had only lately died.
Generally speaking he was opposed to poetry, and very naturally; for it was
the true expression of the former joyous life of paganism. He was therefore
forced to employ rhymed prose for his revelations, which consists in using
short sentences, two or more of which rhyme together. In the oldest <i>suras</i>
Mohammed closely followed the rules of this style of writing so that they
resemble the oracles of the old Arab soothsayers; later on however he
neglected them more and more, made sentences longer than they should
have been, and took many licences with the rhyme which, far from being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
attractive, are real blemishes. If they were found in any other book than
the Word of God, they would have been severely criticised.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was not master of the language, which partly explains the
frequent repetitions to be found in the <i>Koran</i>. Mohammed had much trouble
in composing; he seldom found at once the right word to express his
thought; so he tried all methods, and hence it is that in the <i>Koran</i> the same
ideas recur continually and only the expression changes. The <i>Koran</i> is
crowded with degenerate words, borrowed from the Jewish, the Syrian, and
the Ethiopian languages; the Arab commentators, who knew no other language
than their own, wearied their brains in trying to explain them, without
succeeding, however, in finding the true meaning. Moreover the <i>Koran</i>
contains more than one infraction of the rules of grammar; and if these are
less noticeable, it is because Arab grammarians, wishing to justify them, made
these errors into rules or exceptions to the rules.</p>

<p>The <i>Koran</i> had, moreover, very little influence on Mohammed’s contemporaries.
The Arabs had reached a very high degree of civilisation and of
development&mdash;I refer to intellectual and not to material civilisation; while
Mohammed was a mere enthusiast, like many others elsewhere&mdash;a fanatic,
who was surpassed in understanding, science, intelligence, and even in morality
by more than one of his fellow-citizens. The greater number of his contemporaries
were indifferent to his pious effusions. And, in short, to find
the <i>Koran</i> fine and sublime, faith must first have stifled common sense. The
majority of the nation had not yet reached that stage. So the conversions
one reads of which are attributed to certain passages of the <i>Koran</i> belong
chiefly to the domain of pious legend and not to history; history, in fact,
teaches that the multitude knew little or nothing of the <i>Koran</i>, and that
they were moreover not at all anxious to know it.</p>

<h4>DOCTRINE OF ISLAMISM</h4>

<p>There is no religion less original than Islamism. It has as base Hanifitism
and Mosaism as it was developed under the influence of Parseeism,
together with facts borrowed from the ancient Arabic religion and Christianity,
with the additional dogma that Mohammed is the greatest and
the last prophet of God. That was the sum of the system preached by the
Meccan prophet.</p>

<p>The <i>Koran</i> contains no deep thoughts, no poetic theories depicted in sublime
and moving language. It does not try to resolve great problems by
clothing them in a borrowed symbolic form. Islamism is certainly the most
prosaic and monotonous of religions, and at the same time the least susceptible
of modification and development. How explain this phenomenon?
By the very character of the Arab people, who, in effect, hold specially to
the positive. They seek even poetry in the form rather than the substance;
and, everything taken into consideration, they rather resemble a developed
and reasoning people of the nineteenth century than an ancient nation, still
animated by the poetry of youth which other religions have produced.</p>

<p>Again, Mohammed counts for much. He was not a profound thinker,
but an enthusiast of mediocre talent. Far from aspiring to originality, his
great glory was to avoid it, since he never ceased repeating that the doctrine
he preached had been announced from all time by prophets of old. There
is a third reason still which must not be lost sight of: In other countries
religion developed gradually&mdash;it was not the founder who wrote, but his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
disciples; thus each author imprinted more or less his individuality on his
book, and this circumstance, which naturally excludes uniformity, imposed
on future ages the duty of not keeping to the letter but entering into the
very spirit of the text. There was nothing of this kind in Arabia. There,
a single man regulated everything&mdash;faith, customs, even the law. The
<i>Koran</i> is a book made by one man who exposes the immutable will of God.
Islamism has thus a great fixity. One knows not how to contest it; but, far
from being a cause of satisfaction, this must be deplored; for continual
progress is a task imposed on humanity.</p>

<p>The laws of the <i>Koran</i> still flourish and will do so as long as Islamism
exists. That they were good for those times, and then constituted real
progress, may be admitted without difficulty. But the laws of Charlemagne
were just as excellent for their epoch; yet where would now be all the people
over whom he reigned, had they been condemned always to preserve and
follow these laws? Would not progress have been impossible for western
Europe? The legislation of the <i>Koran</i> hardly enters into the scope of our
subject, and we will keep to its doctrines. It has been so often analysed, and
moreover presents so little originality, that we shall make a very rapid
survey of it.</p>

<p>The unity of God is the first article of faith; the second, the divine mission
of Mohammed. The God of Mohammed resembles the Allah Taala of
the primitive Arabic religion, the Jehovah of Mosaism, and the Ahuramazda
of the Parsee monotheist not yet corrupted. The story of creation is borrowed
from the Jews. The jinns of primitive religion have been preserved,
transformed into angels and demons. That is what Zoroaster did with regard
to the Indian divinities, the devas. It is forbidden to honour the angels,
they are perishable and will die in the day of judgment. The arch-fiend also
has the Hebrew name of Satan and the Greek one of Iblis (Diabolos); but
as Ahriman of the duallist Neopardism has never taken his true signification
in Judaism, the idea the <i>Koran</i> gives of the arch-fiend and his subjects
is more Christian than Jewish. However, Mohammed diverges in one point
from church doctrine&mdash;the impossibility of converting devils. According
to him devils may be converted, and he himself has converted many.</p>

<p>The revelations of God are worked by means of prophets and holy books.
Each period has its revelation which God modifies according to the needs of
the time, and this idea, beautiful in itself, would be fecund if Mohammed
had not given his revelation as the last and most perfect. Adam had already
received the gift of prophecy, and the number of prophets was not inconsiderable,
seeing they were ordinarily reckoned at 124,000, but the six greatest
are Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. The <i>Koran</i>
admits the miraculous birth of Jesus&mdash;for brevity’s sake we will not speak
of all the others&mdash;but he was not the Son of God but a man in the proper
sense of the word, and witnessed in speaking of himself that he was only a
servant of the Divinity; he declares that not he but God alone is omniscient.
On the judgment day, Allah will say: “Oh, Jesus, Son of Mary, hast thou
said to men, place my mother and myself as gods by the side of God?”
And Jesus will answer, “Far be the thought from me; how can I pretend
to a name which does not belong to me?” It is not so clearly seen whether
the <i>Koran</i> admits the Ascension. As to miracles, Jesus did a great number,
even when his mother was still feeding him, and later he raised the dead, etc.
To crown all, it was not he who was crucified, but a man whom they took
for him. The principal object of his doctrine was, like that of all prophets,
to announce the unity of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>Man has five great duties to fulfil. He must admit the two principal
dogmas of Islamism, pray, fast, give alms, and go on pilgrimage to Mecca.
These duties are called the Pillars of Islamism. According to the revelation
made to Mohammed when he journeyed to heaven, and which is not noted
in the <i>Koran</i> (for this book only orders prayers three times a day), all
believers ought, after having gone through the prescribed purifications, to
pray at a given time for five minutes each day, by preference at the mosque.
Mohammed is a great deal more occupied with the ceremonies of prayer than
with the prayer itself, for there are designated passages of the <i>Koran</i> and
consecrated formulas to be recited; so there can be no question of spontaneous
prayer, and if in the Moslem countries the degenerate cult consists in a
mechanical movement of the lips, the fault to a large extent must be attributed
to the prophet himself. The attitudes, gestures, inflexions of the
head and body are exactly regulated by Mohammed himself, and even more
by theologians who came after. On Fridays there is gathering for common
prayer, but the day is not a time of repose like the Jewish Sabbath or the
Christian Sunday. With the exception of prayer-time, each follows his
daily occupation.</p>

<p>Fasting is prescribed for the whole month of Ramadhan. It is only after
sunset that eating and drinking are permitted. Mohammed decreed this law at
Medina, in a time when the fixed lunar year was still followed&mdash;that is, when
the solar year was made up by the intercalation of a supplementary month;
consequently the month of Ramadhan regularly fell in winter. But when
afterwards Mohammed had established the vague lunar year and the month
of Ramadhan fell by chance in summer, it was a severe trial not to dare to
take a drop of water all through the long and stifling summer day. It is
not astonishing, then, that the Moslem is generally morose and bad tempered
during the fast and awaits its end with impatience. But, once over, there
is celebrated on the first day of the month of Khauwal, the most joyous fête
known to Islamism, that of the fast-breaking (<i>aid-al-fitr</i>) or “little fête” (the
little <i>bairam</i> of the Turks), which, in certain countries, lasts three days.
The fifth great duty, which all Moslems of age and free, and of no matter
which sex, have to accomplish once in a life-time is the pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

<h4>THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA</h4>

<p>This pilgrimage was borrowed from the ancient religion with all the ceremonies
which accompany it, although they have been modified in some respects
and received a touch of Islamism. In spite of their great antiquity, they
were not much observed by Arabs in the time of Mohammed except mechanically.
But, as Islamism retained them, it was necessary to justify them.</p>

<p>When Adam had been driven from the terrestrial paradise and sent into
the world, he lamented to God: “Alas! I shall hear no more the angels’
voices.” “That,” said God, “is the result of your sin. But build me a
temple and walk around it thinking of me as you have seen the angels do
around my throne.” Adam arrived in the neighbourhood of Mecca, and
laid there the foundations of the holy temple whilst the angels, aiding him,
brought large blocks of rock from five mountains. It was on to these
foundations that the temple itself descended from heaven. Adam also
received from paradise a tent formed of red hyacinth, in which the place of
repose was the angular stone. Also a white hyacinth, only blackened because
sinners had touched it. This is the famous Black Stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>At the time of the deluge both temple and tent were taken up to heaven,
but the Black Stone was hidden in the mountain of Abu Kobais, which is
near Mecca. Afterwards the spot where the temple had stood remained
known to men and was visited as a sacred place. It was there, in fact, that
Abraham came with Hagar and Ishmael and left them to their fate. The
water which Hagar had brought being soon exhausted, she and her son suffered
greatly from thirst. As far as her eyes could see there was no living
being near. So to get a wider view she climbed Mount Safa, then the Merwa
heights which are opposite, but still saw no one. On returning she found
her son dying of thirst. Not knowing what to do, she returned in haste to
the two hills, and in her misery ran several times from one to the other.
When in desperation she returned, there was water bubbling near her son.
She hastened to pile sand round that it should not escape before she had
filled her pitcher; then she and her son drank. This spring ran in that
place where the wells of Zemzem were afterwards dug.</p>

<p>When on a visit to Ishmael, Abraham told him that God had ordered him
to build a temple in a certain spot; father and son set immediately to work,
and in digging came across the old foundations laid by Adam. Abraham
wanted to set in one of the angles a recognisable stone to mark the spot
where the procession should begin round the temple; but while Ishmael was
seeking a suitable stone the angel Gabriel brought Abraham the Black Stone,
which he had been to fetch from Mount Abu Kobais. Abraham took and
placed it in the angle. When the wall was too high for him to reach up he
mounted on a big stone which Ishmael placed before him and removed when
necessary.</p>

<p>The temple finished, both father and son on Gabriel’s order walked round
it seven times, carefully touching the four corners each time. Then, bowing
twice, they prayed behind the large stone on which Abraham had stood.
Gabriel also taught them the rites which they had to accomplish in other
sacred spots. First they had to hurry rapidly seven times on the path between
the two hills of Safa and Merwa, in memory of the journeys Hagar had
made in her agony. Then he led them to the valley of Mina; but on their
arrival the devil (Iblis) showed himself. “Throw something at him,” said
Gabriel. Abraham obeyed by throwing seven little stones, upon which Iblis
went away. In the middle and at the foot of the valley he was seen again,
but each time Abraham drove him away with little stones. Thence arose the
custom of throwing stones in the Mina valley during the pilgrimage. But
when, led by Gabriel, he had also visited Mozdalifa and Arafa and learned
what ceremonies there were to be performed he received orders to tell all
men they were to go on a pilgrimage to the Kaaba and other sacred spots.
“My voice cannot reach to them,” he answered. “Do what I command you,”
then said God; “I know what to do so that they may hear.”</p>

<p>Abraham stood up on the big stone, and it rose so high that it was above
all the mountains. Turning himself successively to the four cardinal points,
he cried, “O men, a pilgrimage to the ancient house is ordered. Obey your
Lord.” Then from all countries came the answer: “<i>Labbaika, Allahomma,
labbaika</i>;” which means, according to the explanation which the Arabs love
to give to this old formula: “We are ready to serve thee, O God, we are
ready.” It is in perpetual memory of this fact that the print of Abraham’s
feet have remained on this stone. Even to this day it is called Makam
Ibrahim or “Abraham’s station.” This is how the theologians, aided by
a well-known story in Genesis and a Jewish legend which speaks of Abraham
making a journey into Arabia, came to resolve the difficult problem of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
making very old customs agree with the new religion and explain it. The
explanation has not satisfied everyone, but it has sufficed for the majority,
and must certainly be praised for its ingenuity. Being acquainted with what
the majority think about pilgrimages and the meaning they set on ceremonies,
we will here give a brief description of these customs:</p>

<p>First when the boundaries of the sacred territory are crossed and the
pilgrim is purified, the ordinary clothes are doffed and the pilgrim’s garment
or <i>ihram</i> is put on. This is composed of two pieces of linen, wool, or cotton;
one tied round the loins, the other thrown over the neck and shoulders so as
to leave bare a part of the right arm. All head-dress is forbidden, save for
old men and invalids, who have to purchase this dispensation with alms.
Instead of shoes sandals are worn, or the upper part of the boot is cut away
so as to form a kind of sandal. The <i>ihram</i> for women is composed of a mantle
and veil.</p>

<img src="images/p269.jpg" width="300" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Arabic Bronze Tap</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the seventh day of the month of Dhul-Hija, the fête is opened by
a sermon which the kadi of Mecca delivers after the midday prayer, and in
which he reminds the worshippers of the ceremonies they have to accomplish.
On the eighth all repair to Mina, arriving there after a slow walk of two
hours. The journey continues to Mount Arafa, which is six hours’ march
from Mecca. It is on this sacred mountain and in the long valley, that the
night is passed, but very few think of sleep. The devout pray aloud, the
others sing joyful songs, or
pass the time in the cafés.
The grand ceremony at
Arafa consists in a long
preaching which begins on
the ninth at three in the
afternoon and continues till
sunset. This is regarded
as so important that those
who have not heard it, even if they have visited all the sacred spots in
Mecca, cannot pretend to the title of <i>haji</i> (pilgrim). The preacher, who is
generally the kadi of Mecca, is seated on a camel and reads his sermon in
Arabic. Every four or five minutes he stops and raises his arms to implore
the benediction of heaven. During this interval the audience flap the folds
of their pilgrim’s garment and make the air resound with their cries of
“<i>Labbaika, Allahomma, labbaika</i>.” According to the law the preacher must
show visible signs of emotion, so he seldom ceases wiping his eyes with his
handkerchief. The audience must also be deeply moved, recognise their
deep sinfulness, and shed abundant tears.</p>

<p>When at last the sun has set behind the mountains, the preacher closes
his book and the pilgrims run with all their might towards Mozdalifa. A
scene of indescribable confusion arises, for everyone runs as hard as he can,
and the caravans from different countries make it a point of honour to arrive
first at the destination. Foot-travellers, litters, camels are always being
knocked over, there is fighting with sticks and other weapons. At night
there is a magnificent illumination, “so grand that one might imagine that
all the stars from heaven had come down to earth.”</p>

<p>On the tenth is the greatest fête of the year, the “day of sacrifice,” or the
great <i>bairam</i> of the Turks. At daybreak the kadi delivers another sermon
of the same kind as that of the previous day, except that it is shorter; then
the prayers for the fête are read, and when finished all go slowly to the narrow
Mina valley, where there is a village. There they begin to throw stones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
about the size of a kidney bean, which, strictly, ought to have been picked
up at Mozdalifa. But many get them in Mina or use them a second time,
although this is forbidden by law. The first seven little stones are aimed
against a species of pillar or altar of rough stone which is at the entrance
of the valley, in the middle of the route, and which measures six or seven
feet in height. Then seven stones are thrown in the middle of the valley
against a pillar of the same kind, and seven more at the western end against
a stone wall. At the same time they cry: “In the name of God! God
is great! We throw stones to be safe against the devil and his hosts.”</p>

<p>After this the sacrifices begin. The pilgrims immolate the victims they
have brought; and all Mohammedans, in whatsoever part of the world, sacrifice
at the same time. That, generally speaking, ends the pilgrimage. The
pilgrims’ robes may now be doffed, everyday clothes resumed, and many
return to Mecca to make a tour of the Kaaba. But ordinarily a stay of
another two days is made at Mina, and stone-throwing is recommenced.
The eleventh is the day of rest, and a return to Mecca is made on the
twelfth. The pilgrim goes to the Kaaba, which in the interval has received
its new veil, says some prayers, stands in front of the Black Stone, touches
it with the right hand or kisses it, if not hindered by the crowd, and begins
the seven tours, the first three being made rapidly. To each tour belong
certain prescribed prayers to be said; at the end of each one he again
touches or kisses the stone. Then, asking pardon for his sins, he goes
to the station of Abraham, which is quite near, and prays again. Thence
he goes to the sacred well of Zemzem, from which he drinks as much as he
wishes, or as much as the crowd permits; finally he runs seven times rapidly
from the Safa to the Merwa hill. This done, he has accomplished all the
ceremonies, which are so regulated as to their least details that few pilgrims
know them by heart. The strangeness of these ceremonies has even struck
some pious Moslem theologians who do not put very great faith in the
legends. They admit that the act of walking round a temple, running
swiftly between two hills, throwing little stones, etc., does not increase
piety; but they get out of the difficulty by saying the ceremonies are a
sign of divine wisdom, impenetrable to our weak understanding, or a trial of
man’s submission to the mysterious and incomprehensible will of God.</p>

<p>We can pass over the other moral duties imposed by the Moslem religion,
for morals do not vary much in any religion. There is just one
peculiar duty, the holy war, of which we will say a few words.</p>

<h4>THE HOLY WAR</h4>

<p>European opinion for a long time has not been exact. The <i>Koran</i>, if its
sequence of ideas is well studied, gives no order relative to this war against
all infidels; and Mohammed, to begin with, shows himself extremely tolerant,
admitting the possibility of salvation for all those who believe in God
and the last judgment and practice virtue, whatever may be their form of
worship. But the opposition he met with modified his way of looking at
things, and it was then that Islamism became the only religion that could
save. Nevertheless the holy war is not imposed as a duty except and only
in the case of enemies to Islamism being the aggressors. Only an arbitrary
interpretation by theologians can take the orders otherwise.</p>

<p>Another equal error is to think that Islamism has been propagated
by force. Political power, certainly, has been extended in that way, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
religion. The caliphs, far from seeking to make proselytes, for reasons of
pecuniary interest saw with much displeasure the conversion of conquered
peoples.</p>

<p>Mohammed also forbade games of chance and wine. As events then
stood, he had to ask for all in order to obtain anything. The Arabs were
great drinkers and took a certain pride in being so. Even among Mohammed’s
disciples at Medina there were those who came drunk to the mosque.
It was then necessary to agitate against drunkenness, and as warnings on
the subject of this abuse of wine did not produce any effect, he forbade it
altogether. Omar sanctioned the prohibition by adding the penalty of the
whip. The success has not been great. All the time Islamism has existed
wine has been drunk, a great deal of it, indeed; only, out of respect for
the law, it has not been done openly. The alimentary laws are much less rigorous
than with the Jews. Pork, for which moreover the Arabs had a repugnance,
has been forbidden, and as the use of fat generally causes fearful and hideous
diseases in hot countries, it must be recognised that the prohibition in question
is a very wise law in Eastern religions.<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10c"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10c">c</a></span></p>

<h4>ARAB CULTURE</h4>

<p>In the Middle Ages the Arabs were the sole representatives of civilisation.
They opposed that barbarism which spread over Europe, shaken as it
was by invasions of northern peoples, and went back to “the perennial source
of Greek philosophy”; far from resting content with acquired treasures,
they enlarged and opened up new ways to the study of nature.</p>

<p>Wars of invasion, scarcely interrupted by civil discord, far-away expeditions,
and striking triumphs, filled the first century of the Hegira. Even in
760, after the fall of the Omayyads, there was no evidence that to the tumult
of arms would succeed in the caliph empire a period noted only for intellectual
progress. But under the Abbasids a noble emulation, and above all
the example and protection of the sovereigns, dissipated the ignorance and
coarseness with which the disciples of Mohammed were justly charged.
Men’s minds were permeated with new ideas, a number of writings of all
kinds sprang into existence and in their turn gave birth to an infinity of
others, which made Arabic the medium of learning for the East and all
the Moslem states. Nearly all these writings are still extant, and form one
of the vastest literatures ever known.</p>

<p>To the caliph Abu Jafar al-Mansur belongs the credit of the first impulse
given to the study of exact science. Among the confused and incomplete
traditions that exist concerning the ancient Arabs, one catches a glimpse of
notions of practical astronomy. The spectacle of the heavens had attracted
their attention, as it does that of all peoples enjoying a mild climate and
clear air, although without invariably inspiring to consideration of the celestial
laws. All that they had gathered in their intercourse with surrounding
nations was a knowledge of the names of planets and certain stars, which
they deified, an exact indication of the dwellings in the moon, and purely
astrological learning. They went by the lunar year, but it does not appear
they had ever tried to mark time by eras and epochs in general usage. Thus
it is almost impossible to establish a regular order in the long series of facts
which make up the Arabian annals, until that epoch when a timely revolution
broke up the various beliefs of its nomad populations, writing them under
the law of the <i>Koran</i> and developing new desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>“The Arabs,” says Humboldt,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10d"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10d">d</a></span> “were admirably adapted to the rôle of
mediator and to influence the peoples included in the area between the
Euphrates and the Guadalquivir and the southern part of central Africa.
They possessed an unexampled activity which marked a distinct epoch in the
world’s history, a tendency opposed to the intolerant spirit of the Jews,
which led them to mingle with conquered peoples without always abjuring
their national character or traditional remembrances of their native country,
and this in spite of a perpetual change of land. Whilst the German races
did not acquire polish until a long time after their migrations, the Arabs
brought with them not only their religion but also a perfected language and
a wealth of poetry, which was not to be forever lost but was to be found
again among the troubadours and minnesingers of Provence.”</p>

<p>M. Girault de Prangey<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10e"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10e">e</a></span> has studied carefully Arab art, and compared the
architectural monuments of Spain and the East. In the peninsula he distinguishes
three successive epochs. The first, from the eighth to the tenth
century, shows a badly disguised imitation of Christian and Roman buildings.
The mosque of Cordova is doubtless in the same style as that of
Damascus, which it surpassed in magnificence. There is no doubt that the
churches described by Eusebius of Cæsarea,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10f"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10f">f</a></span> with courts, porticoes, fountains,
and priests’ lodgings, served as models for the mosques of Syria, Palestine, and
Egypt. Byzantine mosaics are found in them. But already in 965 a sumptuous
Greek ornamentation seemed insufficient. Details were multiplied, arches
were complicated with festoons and varied curves, such as one sees at Cordova
in the Villaviciosa chapel constructed in the caliphate of Hakim.</p>

<p>The second epoch, from the tenth to the twelfth century, marks the first
development of that Moorish architecture encouraged by the Almoravid and
Almohad princes. The Arabs then strayed from the beaten path. The
ogee arch, porcelain mosaics, fantastic embroideries, ornaments run in stucco,
became fashionable. Inscriptions abounded and became part of the
decorations.</p>

<p>Finally the third epoch, when Arab art attained its apogee, was contemporary
with the splendour of the kingdom of Granada. The Alhambra is
the highest expression of it. The exterior of the palace, so simple yet imposing,
is in conformity with the Moorish habit of hiding from the eyes of
strangers. The entrance is only an immense arch decorated with some
emblems and an inscription recording the founder’s name. The walls are of
a species of mortar mixed with little pebbles which glint in the sunlight. In
the interior, on the contrary, man’s genius has expended its utmost resources.
Vast painted and gilded galleries, adorned with arcades of every shape cut
up with festoons, in stalactites, and loaded with stucco open-work, the rooms
lighted by uncasemented windows, the Ambassadors’ hall, that of the
Two Sisters, the Infantes room, the Comares tower, the court and fountain
of Lions, the Alberca court, below which are baths modelled in the ancient
style&mdash;all offer admirable effects. Here water gushes among millions of
beautiful little columns isolated or grouped picturesquely, there it flows in
marble trenches, now forming cascades, now jets thrown in spray to feed
the basins in the patios surrounded by shrubs and flowers. Everywhere
inscriptions skilfully combined with sculptures express noble and elevated
sentiments, adding fresh charm to the marvel of a palace which Christian
kings partly destroyed.</p>

<p>The interior ornaments of the principal halls of this ancient residence of
Moorish kings are in plaster. The fashion of the relief is geometrical, and
although constantly repeated has none the less beauty and delicacy. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
paintings, artfully distributed and protected by the Andalusian climate, are
to-day as they were in the times of the Abencerrages. In some of the halls
which surround the court of Lions the colours put on by the Arabs still
retain their lustre. They are very pure, composed only of reds, blues, yellows,
and greens. In a recent analysis the blue and red matter was found to
be of ultramarine and vermilion or sulphate of mercury.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, to be regretted that a general study has not been made
of the Arabic buildings in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and even India, of
the different epochs of Arabic rule. It would offer peculiar characters
useful in an exact determination of style. We have reason to hope that
skilful artists will soon supply this want.</p>

<h4>COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY</h4>

<p>The empire of the caliphs, in its extent, its rich soil, varied climate,
people, and regulated condition of its provinces, naturally excited commercial
speculation. The productions of Spain, Barbary, Egypt, Abyssinia,
Arabia, Persia, and Russia, those of countries bordering on the Caspian Sea,
as well as all Indian and China merchandise, came to Mecca, Medina, Cufa,
Bassorah, Damascus, Baghdad, Mosul, and Madain (Modein). The founding
of colonies had created new business centres and opened up important
routes.</p>

<p>The Arabs were, moreover, devoted to industry by that same law which
made of work a duty, and commended commerce and agriculture as meritorious
and pleasing to God. Merchants and their callings elicited equal respect.
Governors of provinces, generals, and servants did not blush to be known as
Khayat the tailor, Atari the druggist, Jauhari the jeweller, etc. Free passage
for merchandise through armies and the safety of the high-roads were maintained
at all points. Wells and cisterns were dug in the desert, caravanseries
were built at certain distances where travellers could find necessary
help at a moderate cost.</p>

<p>Relations existed between Spain and the limits of eastern Asia; an
Arab fleet had gone through the Straits of Gibraltar, and a tempest which
drove them ashore hindered the possible honour of discovering the Azores,
and perhaps America. But though restricted to the old world, the Moslems
gave a strong impulse to every kind of human industry. Spain enriched
herself with the products of Arabian agriculture and manufactures. Cane
sugar, rice, cotton, saffron, ginger, myrrh, ambergris, pistachio, bananas,
henna for dyeing, mohaleb to promote plumpness, were objects of exchange
in the peninsula; tapestry of Cordova leather, Toledo blades, Murcia cloth
made from beautiful wool, Granadan, Almerian, and Sevillian silks, and
gun-cotton were sought in all parts of the world. Sulphur, mercury, copper,
iron were exploited successfully; the finely tempered Spanish steel caused
the helmets and cuirasses coming from its foundries to be quickly bought
up. The environs of Seville were covered with olive trees, and contained
one hundred thousand oil farms or oil-mills. The province of Valencia gave
to Europe southern fruits. From the ports of Malaga, Cartagena, Barcelona,
and Cadiz there were large exportations; and Christian nations patterned
their maritime regulations upon those of the Arabs.</p>

<p>Under the Moors, as M. Darny has said, Toledo had 200,000 inhabitants
and Seville 300,000; to-day the population is rated at 21,000 for the one, and
143,000 for the other. Cordova was eight leagues in circumference, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
60,000 palaces, and 283,000 houses. To-day she has scarcely 56,000 inhabitants.
The diocese of Salamanca then included 125 towns or boroughs; this
number is now reduced to 13. Seville had 6000 workers on silk alone, yet
in 1742 only 10,000 could be counted in the peninsula among both silk and
wool factories.</p>

<p>The geographer Edrisi, who visited Spain in the middle of the eleventh
century, assures us there were in the royal kingdom of Jaen more than 600
towns and hamlets working in silk. The expulsion of the Moors had for Spain
as disastrous results as the revocation of the Edict of Nantes had for French
commerce; and Cardinal Ximenes, desiring that even the remembrance of
the service they had rendered should be destroyed, ordered in a decree
worthy of barbarous times 84,000 Arabian manuscripts to be burned in the
public squares of Granada.</p>

<p>The northerly coasts of Africa had also shown great commercial development.
Numerous factories arose, and the Mauretanian Tingitana rivalled the
peninsula in its manufacturing and rural activity. The country of Sous
recalled Andalusia in its fertility and in the intelligence of its inhabitants.
The East caught the infection of this general industry; at Siraf and Aden
there was an exchange of goods between China, India, Persia, Ethiopia,
and Egypt. Nubian slaves and Habasch, tiger skins, silk, cotton, ivory, and
gold-dust from Zanzibar came from Ethiopia. India and China sent stuffs,
saddles, sandalwood, spices, ebony, lead, tin, pearls, and precious stones.
From Aden these goods were transported to Jiddah, then to Suez, and
shared among Egyptian ports and Syrian coast towns. Countries bordering
on the Caspian Sea bought stores at the Cabul fair; caravans from
Samarcand to Aleppo distributed Chinese silks, cashmere cloth, musk, and
medicinal drugs of Turkestan.</p>

<p>We have set forth the causes and principal effects of the great wave of
civilisation poured forth in the Middle Ages by the Arabs, which rolled
from the columns of Hercules to the confines of Asia. It remains, to complete
this vast picture, only to say a few words on certain Arabian discoveries,
which altered the literary, political, and military conditions of the
entire world. These were paper, the compass, and gunpowder.</p>

<h4>PAPER, COMPASS, AND GUNPOWDER</h4>

<p>One has already seen how many useful and important inventions have
been transmitted to us by the Arabs, and even although they were not
perhaps the originators they must not be refused the glory of having brought
them to the light and of having propagated them from one end of the world
to the other. This is really what they did with paper, the compass, and
gunpowder.</p>

<p>A belief, founded on certain apocryphal writing, that the Chinese knew
the use thereof at a far distant epoch, has been considered sufficient to
rob the Arabs of the honour of having bequeathed these inventions to Europe,
but this is an injustice. It might be said that printing existed in China
from the eighth century; yet the names of Gutenberg, Faust, and Schoeffer
are not less illustrious. Would not the Arabs, if they had taken tissue
paper from them, have also borrowed the art of printing had it then been
known? Would those of the Celestial Empire ever practically have used
chance discoveries? What use have they made of the compass, they who
still believed in 1850 that there was a burning furnace at the South Pole;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
and have they ever applied gunpowder and utilized its power in as many
ways as the Arabs?</p>

<p>It must be remembered that at the siege of Mecca in 690 a kind of bomb
was already in use, and that in Egypt in the thirteenth century powdered
nitre was used to throw projectiles to a great distance with a noise like thunder.
It is also mentioned on the occasion of a naval battle between the king
of Tunis and the emir of Seville in the eleventh century, in 1308 at the siege
of Gibraltar, in 1324 at that of Baeza; also as used by Ismail, king of Granada
in 1340 and by Algeciras in 1342, and Ferreras says positively that the
balls were shot by means of powder. The Spanish thenceforth made use of
it, and one sees the European armies little by little provided with cannon,
while no mention is made of their trials and attempts which would necessarily
have preceded the organisation of artillery if the actual invention of
gunpowder had originated with Christian nations as some writers and historians
have long claimed.</p>

</div>

<p>With regard to the compass, nothing proves that the Chinese used it for
navigation, while we find the Arabs using it in the eleventh century, not
only for sea voyages, but in caravan journeys through the desert, and to
determine the azimuth of the Kiblah, that is the direction of the Moslem
oratories towards Mecca. It was the same with paper. Towards the
year 650 silk paper was already being made at Samarcand and Bokhara.
In 706 Jusuf Amron at Mecca thought of substituting cotton for silk;
hence the “damask paper,” of which Greek historians speak. In Spain,
where linen and hemp were more common, arose factories for linen paper.
“The Xativa paper,” says the geographer Edrisi, “is excellent and incomparable.”
Valencia and Catalonia soon afterwards proved formidable rivals
to Xativa (Jativa). In the thirteenth century Arabian paper was used at
Castile, whence it penetrated into France, Italy, England, and Germany.
But Arabian manuscripts always led in the fineness and glossiness of their
paper, as well as in the choice of ornamentation in lively and brilliant
colours.</p>

<p>It was thus that the influence exercised by the Arabs manifested itself
in every branch of modern civilisation. From the ninth to the fifteenth
century the most voluminous literature extant was formed, productions
were multiplied; valuable inventions attested the wonderful activity of
men’s minds at this epoch; and their influence, felt throughout Christian
Europe, justified the opinion that the Arabs have led us in all things.
On the one hand we find inestimable material for a history of the Middle
Ages&mdash;narratives of voyages, the happy idea of the biographical dictionary;
on the other, unequalled industry, buildings grandiose in thought and
execution, important discoveries in the arts. Does not all this reveal the
work of a people too long disdained?<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10g"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10g">g</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<h4>INFLUENCE OF THE ARABS ON EUROPEAN CIVILISATION</h4>

<p>“The nations of Europe,” says Bailly in one of his letters to Voltaire,
“after having grown old in barbarism, were only enlightened by the invasion
of the Moors and the arrival of the Greeks.” We venture to add&mdash;and far
more by the invasion of the Moors, or of those to whom Bailly gives the
name, than by the arrival of the Greeks of the Lower Empire. And, indeed,
one of the distinctive and prominent characteristics of the influence which
the Arabs exercised on all branches of modern civilisation, is precisely that
of having restored to Europe a knowledge of the ancient Greek authors,
whose language, works, and even names, were completely forgotten.</p>

<p>It may be boldly asserted that the numerous translations and still more
numerous commentaries which the Arabs wrote on all the works of Ancient
Greece, and which makes their literature the second daughter of Greek literature,
served to give the modern peoples their first notions of the sciences
and letters of antiquity. It was only after having known them through
the versions of the Arabs that the desire to possess and understand the
original writers took shape, and that the language of Homer and Plato
found several diligent interpreters. Indeed, “The greater part of Greek
erudition,” according to Hyde,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10h"><!-- letter not in references list for this chapter -->h</span> “which we have to-day from those sources,
we received first from the hands of the Arabs.”</p>

<p>In order to justify this assertion, which may seem a little paradoxical, it
will be sufficient to call attention to the fact that the Arabs had transmitted
to Europe, without disguising its origin, the knowledge they borrowed from
the Greeks, long before Boccaccio’s guest, Leontius Pilatus, had started a
course on the Greek language at Florence (about 1360), and the dispersal of
the inhabitants of Constantinople, after the taking of that town by Muhammed
II (1453), had rendered their idiom a common study in Europe. Indeed
many Greek books, and notably those which treated of the sciences,
were originally translated from Arab into Latin. Among others may be cited
the earliest versions of Euclid and Ptolemy.</p>

<p>A not less certain proof that Greek letters first received an asylum from
the Arabs, is that several works of Ancient Greece have been preserved by
them, and discovered in their own works. Mathematicians, for instance,
would never have possessed the <i>Sphericals</i> of the geometrician Menelaus of
Alexandria, who was antecedent to Ptolemy, but for the Arab translation
(<i>Kitab al-Okar</i>), which was afterwards translated into Latin, nor the eight
books of Apollonius of Perga’s <i>Conic Sections</i>, if the Maronite, Abraham
Ecchellensis, had not copied and translated (1661) the missing fifth and sixth
and seventh books from an Arab manuscript in the Medici library in Florence;
neither would the doctors have been able to complete Galen’s Commentaries
on Hippocrates’ <i>Epidemics</i> without the Arab translation discovered
in the Escurial, and the naturalists would not even possess an abridgement
of Aristotle’s <i>Treatise on Stones</i> but for the Arab manuscript in our (the
French) National library.</p>

<p>If we trace the whole history of human knowledge, and recall the fact
that Greece survived Rome in Alexandria, we may well assign the Arabs the
position of guardians to that sacred depôt between Greece and the Renaissance.
“They merit,” says M. Libri,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10i"><!-- letter not in references list for this chapter -->i</span> “eternal gratitude for having been
the preservers of the learning of the Greeks and Hindus, when those people
were no longer producing anything and Europe was still too ignorant to
undertake the charge of the precious deposit. Efface the Arabs from history
and the Renaissance of letters will be retarded in Europe by several centuries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p277.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bronze Cannon and Mounting</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the matter of science especially, and far more than their forerunners
the Romans, the Arabs were the heirs of the Greeks. If they far preferred
Aristotle’s philosophy to that of Plato, it may have been because they
saw in Plato what he actually was, namely one of the fathers of the
Christian church, but it was certainly because Aristotle mingled the positive
sciences with metaphysical speculation. Nevertheless Plato (Aflathoun), as
well as Aristotle (Aristhathlis or Aristou), received from them the surname
of <i>Al-Elahi</i>, or the Divine. It was not only on the masters, <i>principes Scriptores</i>,
on Aristotle, Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Euclid, Ptolemy, Strabo, that
their studies were directed and concentrated; there is no grammarian so
mediocre, no rhetorician so poor, no sophist so subtle, that the Arabs have not
translated and commented on him.</p>

<h4>SCHOLASTICISM</h4>

<p>It was in passing through their hands that the peripatetic doctrine
engendered scholasticism. It is certain that, in the interminable wrangle
between Realists and Nominalists the former leaned on the authority of
Avicenna, the others on that of Averrhoës; it is certain, according to the
observation of M. Hauréau,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10j"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10j">j</a></span> that the philosopher Al-Kendi is often quoted
by Alexander of Hales, Henry of Ghent and St. Bonaventura, whilst Al-Farabi
furnished his aphorisms to William d’Auvergne, Vincent de Beauvais,
and Albertus Magnus; and that this same William d’Auvergne prefers the
Arabs far above the Greeks, finding the Greeks too much of philosophers
and the Arabs more of theologians. Doubtless scholasticism was a vain and
regrettable learning, for the schools of the Middle Ages, as Condillac says,
resembled the knights’ tournaments, but, all the same, it produced some free
thinkers, such as Johannes Scotus Erigena, Berengarius, Abélard, and
William of Occam; and it was from it that, in after time, proceeded John
Huss, Savonarola, Luther, Bruno, and Campanella.</p>

<p>After having laid hands on the various branches of the knowledge possessed
by the ancient Greeks, who had remained superior to the Latins, in
the sciences even more than in letters and not less than in the arts, and after
having enlarged its domain in all directions, the Arabs laid it open to the
nations of Europe, all of whom they had outdistanced. Spain was naturally
the first to receive and spread their gifts. In the tenth century, in the
most profound darkness of the Middle Ages, that country “to which,” says
Haller,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10o"><!-- letter not in references list for this chapter -->o</span> “the humanities fled together,” was the only one which accepted
and welcomed those solid studies, which were everywhere else repelled and
destroyed, even in Constantinople, since the time of Leo the Isaurian (717).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
Indeed, as early as the tenth century, when the Muzarab, John of Seville,
translated the Holy Scriptures into Arabic, and when another Muzarab,
Alvaro of Cordova, reproached his compatriots with forgetting their language
and their law (<i>legem suam nesciunt christiani et linguam propriam non
advertunt Latini</i>), in order to train themselves in the Arab doctrine (<i>Arabico
eloquio sublimati</i>), Spain counted several illustrious scholars, Ayton, bishop
of Vich, a Lupit of Barcelona, and a Joseph, who instructed Adalbero, archbishop
of Rheims, all versed in mathematics and astronomy.</p>

<h4>MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE</h4>

<p>To Spain then came the small number of foreigners who were tormented
by the desire to know. Gerbert (born in Auvergne about 930, elected pope
in 999, under the name of Silvester II, died in 1003), so celebrated for his
adventures, his learning, and his labours, after going through all the schools
of France, Italy, and Germany without being able to satisfy the passion for
instruction which possessed him, came finally to Spain to seek that physical
and mathematical knowledge which raised such admiration in France, Germany,
and Italy, whither he returned to spread them, that the prodigies of
his learning could only be explained by the accusation of having delivered
himself over to the devil.</p>

<p>Gerbert is unanimously credited with having been the first to introduce
the use of Arabic figures into these countries, and with having added some
elementary notions of algebra to the calculations of arithmetic. He also
passes as the first constructor of clocks. Whether, as most of his biographers
affirm, Gerbert pursued his studies as far as the homes of the Arabs in
Cordova and Seville, or whether he only made a long sojourn in Catalonia
and associated with the scholars of that country, as is witnessed to by his
collection of <i>Epistles</i>, addressed in great part to Catalans like Borrell, count
of Barcelona, Ayton, Joseph, and Lupit, it is none the less certain that Gerbert
learned all he knew from the Arabs, and that that knowledge, so
prodigious as to appear supernatural, was, as William of Malmesbury says,
“stolen from the Saracens.”</p>

<p>His example and his success roused other foreigners to come and glean,
where he had made so ample a harvest. The German Hermannus-Contractus
(who died in 1054), author of the book, <i>De Compositione Astrolabii</i>; the
English Adelard, who translated the first Arabic <i>Euclid</i> into Latin (about
1130); the Italian Campano of Novara, who published a <i>Theory of
the Planets</i>; Daniel Morley; Otto of Freising; with Hermann the German;
Plato of Tivoli; Gerard of Cremona, who translated at Toledo itself,
Alhazen; Avicenna, Rhazes, Albucasis, and even Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i>, not
from the Greek, but from the Arabic&mdash;that Gerard of Cremona of whom it
was said: “At Toledo he lived, Toledo he raised to the stars”&mdash;all went
in succession to gather in Spain the elements of mathematics, physics, and
astronomy, which they carried thence to their compatriots.</p>

<p>Montucla<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10k"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10k">k</a></span> not only says that “the Arabs were long the sole depositaries
of learning, and that it is to their commerce that we owe the first rays of
light which came to chase away the darkness of the eleventh, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries”; he adds that “during this period, all who obtained
the greatest reputation in mathematics had been to acquire their knowledge
amongst the Arabs.” It is asserted that all the authors who wrote on the
exact sciences before the fifteenth century did nothing but copy the Arabs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
or, at the most, enlarge upon their lessons. Such were the Italian Leonardo
da Pisa, the Polish Vitellio, the Spaniard Raymond Lully, the English
Roger Bacon, and finally the French Arnauld de Villeneuve, who is credited
with having discovered spirits of wine, oil of turpentine, and other chemical
preparations.</p>

<p>During the same period, the whole of European geography was limited
to the <i>Seven Climates</i> of Edrisi, and, in the seventeenth century, when
correcting by Abu Ishak Ibrahim ben Yahya certain geographical errors,
Abraham Hinckelmann was able to say: “The greatest assistance and illumination
for posterity we owe to Arabism.” As to the famous <i>Astronomical
Tables</i> of Alfonso X, they, like his book on <i>Armillaries</i> or celebrated spheres,
only sum up the discoveries of the Arabs previous to the thirteenth century.
It was from their works that all his learning was drawn by that celebrated
monarch, who received the surname of the Wise (or learned), and who did
indeed effect some advancement in science, between the system of Ptolemy
and that of Copernicus. The <i>Alphonsine Tables</i> are borrowed from the
various <i>Ziji</i> or tables of the Arab astronomers, and reproduce their form
and substance.</p>

<p>When Louis XIV had a degree of the meridian measured geometrically,
in order to determine the size of the earth, he doubtless did not know that
five centuries before, the caliph Al-Mamun had ordered the same operation
to be performed by his astronomers at Baghdad. In the Middle Ages,
according to Bailly,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10l"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10l">l</a></span> “the first step taken towards the revival of learning
was the translation of Alfergan’s <i>Elements of Astronomy</i>.” That famous
Spanish rabbi, Aben-hezra (or Esdra), who was surnamed the Great, the
Wise, the Admirable, on account of his book on <i>The Sphere</i>, was born at
Toledo, in 1119, and had been a disciple of the Arabs in astronomy. He
spread his masters’ lessons throughout Europe. It was from Albategnius,
more than from Ptolemy, that Sacrobosco (John of Holywood) had drawn
the materials for his book <i>De Sphera Mundi</i>; it was in Albategnius, too,
that the commentator on that great astronomer, Regiomontanus (Johann
Müller, of Königsberg, <i>Regius Mons</i>), had found the first notion of tangents.
It was from Alhazen’s <i>Twilight</i> that the illustrious Kepler took his ideas
of atmospheric refraction; and it may be that Newton himself owes to the
Arabs, rather than to the apple in his orchard at Woolsthorpe, the first apperception
of the system of the universe; for Muhammed ben Musa (quoted
in the <i>Bibliot. arab. Philosophorum</i>) seems, when writing his books on <i>The
Movement of the Celestial Bodies</i> and on <i>The Force of Attraction</i>, to have had
an inkling of the great law of general harmony.</p>

<h4>MEDICINE</h4>

<p>The influence of the Arabs on all the natural sciences, chemical or medical,
is not less incontestable than their influence on the mathematical sciences.
Roger Bacon and Raymond Lully were as much their pupils in the attempted
science of alchemy, the “grand art,” as in the actual science of numerical
calculations. It was by them also that Albertus Magnus (Albrecht Grotus
or Gross, born in Swabia in 1193), that universal scholar, the eminent master
of St. Thomas Aquinas, whom, like Gerbert, men called “the magician,”
was initiated into all the learning of the Aristotelian school. And even
after the year 1600, Fabricius Acquapendente could say, “Celsus amongst
the Latins, Paulus Ægineta amongst the Greeks, and Albucasis amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Arabs, form a triumvirate to whom I confess that I am under the greatest
obligations.”</p>

<p>Even as the astronomer Albategnius in the domain of heaven, or the
geographer Edrisi in that of the earth, so Avicenna and Averrhoës reigned
supreme over medicine, during six hundred years, down to the sixteenth
century. At Montpellier and Louvain, commentaries on Avicenna were
still being made in the last century. Both Boerhaave and Haller concede
this long predominance to Arab medicine, and Brucker could say with
perfect truth: “Until the renascence of literature, not only among the
Arabs, but also indeed among the Christians, Avicenna rules all but alone.”
When, in the very beginning of the thirteenth century, the Portuguese doctor
Pedro Juan, who was archbishop of Braga and then pope under the title
of John XXI, wrote his <i>Treasury of the Poor</i>, or <i>Remedies for all Maladies</i>,
his <i>Treatise on Hygiene</i>, and his <i>Treatise on the Formation of Man</i>, he was
copying the Arabs.</p>

<p>It was from Spain then that all the doctors of Europe came, and that,
through them, the taste for science and letters was extended. “The Spanish
doctors,” says Haller, “while their people were gradually recovering the
country, communicated the love of letters to the Italians.” It was to
Spain, at all events, that the Jews, then so renowned for their healing art,
went to study, to afterwards scatter, like young doctors leaving the university,
through the various countries of Europe. Kings and popes took
their doctors from the Jews. To cite only a few famous instances, we call
attention to the fact that the physician of Alfonso the Fighter, king of
Aragon, Pedro Alfonso, author of some Latin tales, part of which were
translated in Francesco Sansovino’s <i>Cento Novelle Antiche</i>, was a converted
Jew; and Paul Ricius, physician to the emperor Maximilian I, was a Jew
who remained a Jew. The latter had studied in Spain, where he translated
the <i>at-Takrif</i> of Albucasis, the book which Haller calls the “common fountain”
of modern medicine. We have seen that the Arabs practised a multitude
of surgical operations, unknown to the ancients, and in like manner
enriched pharmacy by a multitude of new medicaments.</p>

<p>But one fact sums up in itself all the proofs of the influence which the
Arabs exerted on the medical art, and that is that the famous school of
Salerno, whose laws were once followed throughout Europe, owes its origin
to the Arabs. When (about 1000) the Norman, Robert Guiscard, took
Salerno from the people called Saracens, who had occupied the south of Italy
for more than two centuries, he found a school of medicine established there
by these infidels. He had the wisdom to preserve it, enrich it, and to give
it Constantine Africanus as chief. This man was a Moor from Carthage,
whom travels and adventures flung, like Edrisi, into the power of the Normans
of Sicily; who took the cowl at the monastery of Monte Cassino under
the celebrated abbot Desiderius, afterwards Pope Victor III; and, in his
retreat, translated into Latin all his compatriots’ works on the healing art.
He thus ended by founding the school of Salerno, for it was from his works
that all the aphorisms of the <i>Medicina Salertina</i> were taken. As the University
of Montpellier had for founders (about 1200) the Aragonese, to
whom that town, which was then almost modern and had not yet inherited
the bishopric of Maguelonne, at that time belonged, it may be asserted,
according to the generally received tradition, that its faculty of medicine
was founded at least indirectly by the Arabs, and that it was in that sense
grounded on their teaching&mdash;the sole adopted, the sole reigning one, the
most enlightened and scientific of the age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<h4>ARCHITECTURE</h4>

<p>As to the influence of Arabs on architecture, the only one of the fine
arts which religion permitted Moslems to cultivate, it seems that it cannot
be set in doubt that it appears with as much certainty as distinction. The
question has often been asked: Whence came it that the architecture of
the close of the Middle Ages, that which passed from the round to the
pointed arch, and from basilicas to cathedrals, was called Gothic? As this
name, if it implied a northern origin, would be in flagrant contradiction with
the facts, the question has remained unanswered.</p>

<p>But we must remind ourselves that the name Gothic has not been given
only to the architecture which the twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw
prevailing. The handwriting and the missal, which in the year 1091 were
replaced in Spain by the Latin (then called French) characters, and by the
Roman ritual, were also called Gothic. They had received and preserved
this name of Gothic because their use dated from the time when Spain was
the domain of the Goths. Might it not also be because the first lessons
in the new architecture came to Europe through Spain, that this architecture,
<i>e.g.</i>, like the Spanish handwriting and liturgy, was named Gothic?</p>

<p>This perfectly simple and natural explanation is, moreover, in complete
accordance with history. The conjectures of men versed in the matter are
agreed on this point&mdash;that modern architecture had its birth at Byzantium,
that second Rome where the arts took refuge when they were driven out of
Italy. The Byzantine architects, who were the first to mingle the capricious
and flowery style of the East with the sober and regular style of ancient
Greece, had two sorts of pupils&mdash;the Arabs and the Germanic peoples.
The former first founded the architecture called Moorish or Saracen; and
afterwards the latter, that which later on was called Gothic. Starting from
the same point the two architectures remain analogous, almost similar,
during two centuries, both preserving, with the differences imposed by the
climate, the traditions of their common origin. Thus the mosque of Cordova,
raised by a prince of Syria, and the old basilicas of Germany are
equally sprung from the Byzantine style. Then they separate, to take each
a style of its own. The Moslem architecture preserves the system of surbased
naves, and takes as its special characteristic the horseshoe arch, that is to say,
one narrowing at its base, and having the form of an inverted crescent.</p>

<p>Christian architecture adopts the system of high, pointed naves, and its
distinctive characteristic becomes the pointed arch, substituted for the pagan
round arch. But it must be noticed that the Arabs had employed the
pointed arch before the Christians; that, in Spain especially, a multitude of
monuments prove their use of this form which was unknown to antiquity;
and that it is doubtless because the pointed arch, now become the striking
and characteristic feature of Christian architecture, had passed from
Spain into Europe, that the whole system was named Gothic. Finally, these
two architectures derived from Byzantium, the Arab and the Germanic,
becoming ever more and more assimilated, end by merging, at the close of
eight centuries, into the style called Renaissance. No one denies, no one
disputes, the striking resemblance which exists between the Arab monuments
and those of Europe in the Middle Ages. This resemblance is not
only found in the great edifices of the capitals, for the construction of which
Saracen architects were sometimes called in, as happened in the case of Notre
Dame de Paris itself. It can be traced even in the humblest buildings of
the little towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>“Thus,” says Viardot,<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10m1"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10m">m</a></span> “I have found the multilobar arch of the Mezquita
at Cordova in the cloisters of Norwich cathedral, and the delicate
colonnette of the Alhambra in the church of Notre Dame at Dijon. This
resemblance was, then, not merely casual and fortuitous; it was general
and permanent. Nothing further is needed to prove the thesis. If Christian
and Arab art resembled each other, and if one preceded the other, it is
evident that of the two one was imitated and the other the imitator. Was
it the Arab art which imitated the Christian art? No; for the priority of
its works is manifest and incontestable; for Europe, in the Middle Ages,
received all its knowledge from the Arabs, and must also have received from
them the only art whose cultivation the law of religion permitted.”</p>

<h4>MUSIC</h4>

<p>The impossibility which exists, in spite of the efforts of all modern
scholars, of our having an acquaintance, even an imperfect and approximate
one, with the music of the Greeks, must teach and give a conception of the
great difficulty of procuring proofs of the state of this art, or discovering
and understanding monuments of it, once the traditions are interrupted. It
is a dead language in which none can now read. In the preceding section
we have had to limit ourselves to demonstrating that the Arabs cultivated
music as a very important and very advanced art. In the archives of the
chapter of Toledo, there exists a precious monument of the influence which
they exercised on modern music. This is a manuscript, annotated in the
hand of Alfonso the Wise himself, and including the canticles (<i>cantigas</i>)
composed by that prince, with the music to which they were sung. In it
we find not only the six notes <i>ut</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>la</i>, invented, towards 1030,
by the monk Guido of Arezzo, but also the seventh note, the five lines, and
the keys, whose discovery was subsequent, and even the upward and downward
tails of the notes, the use of which was not introduced into the musical
writing of the rest of Europe until much later. Up till then music had
served only for the psalmodies of the church, for the plain chant of hymns
and antiphons. This manuscript, copied and cited in the <i>Paleographia Castellana</i>
is, according to all appearance, the most ancient monument of the
regular application of music to ordinary and profane poetry.</p>

<p>As Alfonso X owes his prodigious learning chiefly to the study of the
Arabs, it would be scarcely possible to doubt that, for this book as for all
his works, he borrowed from them a science already formed and even then
committed to writing by Al-Farabi, Abul-Faraj, etc., and which Alfonso
might very well have understood with the help of the Muzarabs of Seville.
This supposition, which would attribute to the Arabs a notable share in the
creation of modern music, has all the more the appearance of truth since
the first instruments adopted by the Spaniards, the French, and the other
nations of Europe were named <i>moresques</i> in all languages. To this day the
<i>chirimia</i> and <i>dulzaina</i> of the Moors, so often mentioned by Cervantes and his
contemporaries, are still used in the country of Valencia. As to the modern
stringed instruments, they all had as model the lute (<i>al-aoud</i>, whence <i>laud</i>
in Spanish) of the Arabs, who have also given Spain the <i>kitara</i> (<i>guitarra</i>),
since become the national instrument of the people whose masters they were
in all things.</p>

<p>Several theorists, J. J. Rousseau amongst others, have proposed to write
music in figures, assuredly without suspecting that the Arabs had already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
practised that mode of notation. Kiesewetter<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10n"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10n">n</a></span> calls attention to the fact
that, the Arab scale having seventeen intervals, the Arabs were able to write
and actually did write music with their figures, employing the numbers one
to eighteen for the first octave, one to thirty-five for two octaves, and so on.
May it not be from this ancient use of the Arab figures in musical writing
that the employment of the same figures for the figured bass, in which a
simple number denotes a chord, came into vogue? It is possible and very
probable.</p>

<p>The old Spanish music, that which is preserved in Andalusia under the
name of <i>cañas</i>, <i>rondeñas</i>, <i>playeras</i>, etc., differing greatly from the <i>boleros</i> of
comic operas and eluding the modern notation, is certainly of Arab origin.
Who are they who have preserved it in the tradition of this country? An
eastern race, a nomadic race, that of those Bohemians who, coming from
Egypt about the fourteenth century, and perhaps before that from India,
spread themselves throughout Europe and were called <i>gitanos</i> in Spain,
<i>zingari</i> in Italy, gipsies in England, <i>zigeuner</i> in Germany, and <i>tzigani</i> in
Russia, whilst naming themselves <i>pharaons</i>.</p>

<p>These nomads, with their immutable customs, who are still to-day not
only in Spain but in Russia the same in physique and moral character as
Cervantes has depicted them, have carried and retained everywhere the
ancient songs of their problematic country. As the musicians of the people,
formed into troupes of singers and dancers, they have everywhere spread the
form and sentiment of their antique melodies. “It was through them,” concludes
Viardot, “that, in Russia as in Spain, popular music took or kept
the oriental character; it was from them that in Moscow, at the foot of the
towers of the Kremlin, I listened to the same songs as in the gardens of
the Alhambra of Granada. In both places I had heard from their lips a
living echo of the Arab music.”<span class="enanchor" id="parthians_enanchor_10m2"><a href="#parthians_endnote_10m">m</a></span></p>

<p>People who are unlearned in the law, are apt to assume that it executes
itself; or at least they think it absolutely necessary that law and the execution
of law should go hand in hand. But in the primitive stages of human
society it was not so. The law existed long before there was any magistracy
to carry it into effect, and even after magisterial authority had been
established, it frequently left, not only the pursuit, but the execution of law
to the parties concerned. An instructive picture of such a state of things is
found in the copious literature that has been preserved with regard to the
Epic Period of the ancient Arabs, <i>i.e.</i>, the period immediately preceding
their amazing irruption into the world’s history through the gate of Islam.</p>

<p>The desert has imprinted its stamp upon the Arabs. They are particularly
interesting for this very reason, that by the desert they have, so to speak,
been arrested at what is in many respects a very primitive stage of development.
Yet we must not imagine them roving about it like wild animals,
gathering together for temporary ends and dispersing just as they please.
As a matter of fact, they have no settled abodes, they are not tied to the
soil nor linked with one another by a fixed domicile, and consequently they
are not organised on the basis of locality, according to districts, towns, and
villages. But they have instead an inner principle of association and organisation,
of union and distinction, inherent in the very elements of race. It is
the principle of consanguinity, of kinship. For the Arab, his political <i>genus</i>,
his <i>differentia specifica</i>, are innate as indelible characteristics. He knows the
clan to which he belongs, and the stock to which his clan belongs; the tribe
or nation of which the stock is a part, and the larger group that includes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
tribe or nation. Associations are regarded by them as natural units, founded
on consanguinity, and they stand in a close and natural relationship, one to
another, corresponding to nearer or remoter degrees of consanguinity (by
the father’s side) so that their statistics assume the form of a genealogy.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Hebrews this form survived even after they had settled
in towns and villages; Isaac was the father of the nations of Israel and
Edom, Israel the father of twelve tribes, Judah the father of five lineages,
and each lineage in its turn father or grandfather of clans and families.
Such a principle of organisation is equally serviceable for settlement or migration,
for war or peace; and being independent of all conditions of fixed
localities, it makes the tribe as mobile as an army. For an army, too,
must possess an organisation adaptable to every place, and as suitable to a
hostile country as to its own. But an army is broken up into artificial divisions;
the men may be put into one branch or another at will, and the place
of the individual in the whole scheme is notified by artificial marks of distinction.
With the Arabs, on the other hand, the form is indistinguishable
from the substance, they are born into their cadres, and their uniform is, as
it were, innate to them. The closer or remoter circles of kindred, from the
clan to the nation, are their companies, battalions, and regiments, which include
not only the fighting men, but their wives and children also, though
the latter take no direct part in any fight.</p>

<p>The two most important stages of the political affinity are the highest
and the lowest, the two poles, as it were, of the system; the intermediate
stages are less important, because they assume the qualities of one pole or
the other, according to circumstances. The highest association, which we
call the tribe, includes all the families which migrate together regularly,
<i>i.e.</i>, which make the circuit of certain hunting-grounds, often great distances
apart, according to the season of the year. One tribe will not contain more
than a few thousand souls; if it exceeds that number, it becomes too large
for common migration and pasturage and is obliged to divide. The lowest
is the clan, which consists of families within the nearest degrees of kinship,
which invariably pitch their tents close together in a common quarter (<i>dâr</i>).</p>

<p>Beyond the tribe the bond of consanguinity does not break off abruptly;
it embraces also the group of such tribes which stand in any sort of historic
relation to one another. But in this wider circle the ties of kinship cease to
be really effective.</p>

<p>The Arabs as a whole, though linked together by community of speech,
of intellectual acquirements and social forms, are not really a nation; neither
can the larger groups into which they have split up be called nations; the
nation is the tribe. The tribe is the source and the limit of political obligation;
what lies outside the tribe is alien. This does not mean that a perpetual
and open <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i> prevails in Arabia; the relations
of the tribes among themselves vary greatly, and may be friendly as a result
of kinship and treaty. But inasmuch as the idea of common duty of man to
man does not exist among them, and no moral law is valid beyond the tribe,
everybody alien from the tribe is an enemy as a matter of course. If he is
caught in the hunting-grounds of the tribe without a special security, he
is an outlaw and fair game. “When I and my people were tormented with
hunger,” says an old Bedouin, “God sent me a man who was travelling alone
with his wife and his herd of camels; I slew him and took his wife and
camels for my own.” He considers the murder perfectly lawful, and is only
surprised that a stranger should presume to rove about the country with his
wife and his cattle and without a strong escort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>Yet the narrow bounds of the tribal community are capable of enlargement.
There are means whereby even the alien can attain the security of a
member of the tribe. If he seizes the hem of his enemy’s garment from behind,
or ties a knot in the end of his turban, or knots his rope with his own,
he has nothing further to fear. If he succeeds in creeping into the other’s
tent, or in being introduced and entertained there by the wife or child, his
life is sacred. The sanctity of the hearth is unknown among the Arabs, even
their altar is not a hearth and is without any fire; but, on the other hand, the
tent and those within it are sacred, and even to touch the tent-cords from
outside renders a stranger safe from attack. By a sacramental act, accompanied
with a simple form of words, he disarms his enemy and assures his
own safety. Of course protection is not always stolen, as it were, in this
fashion, it may be extended voluntarily; for example, there are cases when
the man who grants protection flings his mantle over the one who implores
it, thus making him out as his own property which no man may injure.</p>

<p>If a foreign trader desires to travel through the tribe without peril, one
of its members must give him a safe-conduct; very often he merely gives
him some recognisable piece of his own property to take with him as a passport
or charter of legitimation. The relations which arise in this manner are,
for the most part, transitory.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>But there are also permanent and hereditary relations of this sort, based
in part upon contract and oath. A member of a tribe may allow a stranger
to sojourn permanently with his clan, and by adoption into the clan the sojourner
is considered naturalised by the whole tribe. Not individuals only, but
whole clans and families can thus be naturalised, and instances thereof are not
uncommon. A fresh element is consequently grafted on the pure tribal stock
in these sojourners or protégés. In a few generations they may amalgamate
with the tribal stock, but as fresh batches are constantly coming in from
without, the distinction between the two elements within the tribe remains.</p>

<p>Consanguinity and contiguity combine to weld the tribe together; external
bonds there are none. Blood-relationship is the higher and stronger
principle, and neighbourhood passes into brotherhood. All political and
military duties are looked upon as obligations of blood or brotherhood. The
relations of the individual to larger associations and the community as a
whole are precisely the same in character, though less intimate in degree, as
those which bind him to his own family. There is no <i>res publica</i> in contradistinction
to domestic concerns, no difference, in fact, between what is public
and what is private. In principle, at least, all men have the same rights
and duties, and no man has one-sided rights or duties. Everything is
based on reciprocity, on loyalty and fellowship, and the complementary notions
of duty and right, of ruler and subject, of patron and client, are expressed by
one and the same word. There are neither officers nor officials, neither jailers
nor executioners. There is no magisterial authority, no sovereign power,
separable from the association and the individual, with a revenue of its own
drawn from taxation and an independent administration by official organisation.
The functions of the community are exercised by all its members
equally. The prerogative and obligations of the state as we understand it,
which can only be fitly discharged by its civil officers, are to the Arab things
that the individual is bound to do, not under compulsion from without, but
from the corporate feeling of neighbourhood and brotherhood. By his own
active exertions the individual has constantly to create afresh those things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
which with us are permanent organisations and institutions, which lead or
seem to lead an independent life of their own. The Arabs stop at the foundations,
building no upper story upon them which could be handed over
ready-made to their heirs and in which they might live at their ease.</p>

<p>In other words, among the Arabs political relations are moral, for morality
is confined within the limits of the tribe. Political organisation is represented
by the corporate feeling which finds expression in the exercise of the
duties of brotherhood. These require a man to say “good day” to his fellows,
or “God bless you,” if anyone sneezes, not to shut himself up from others,
nor to take offence easily, to visit the sick, to pay the last honours to the dead,
to feed the poor in time of dearth, to protect and care for the widow and
the orphan; likewise to slaughter a camel now and again in winter, to
arrange sports and there regale the rest with its flesh, for no man slaughters
for himself alone, and every such occasion is a feast for the whole company.
Such are the common demonstrations of brotherly kindness by which corporate
spirit is kept alive under ordinary circumstances. But the greatest
duty in which all others culminate is to help a brother in need. Political duty
therefore occupies an essentially subordinate place. The great thing in all
cases is that the individual should act and should see himself how to get along,
but, of course, he is quite at liberty to concert measures with his comrades.
The rest are only bound to assist him in time of need, and then they must
answer to his call without asking whether he is right or wrong; as he has
brewed, so they must drink. The whole tribe does not always rise at once,
the primary obligation rests with the clan. The clan has the right of inheritance
together with the next duty of paying the debts of any member of it,
delivering him from captivity, acting as his compurgators, and assisting him
in procuring vengeance or paying mulcts. The larger associations only
become involved when the need is great, and more particularly in cases of
enmity with another tribe.</p>

<p>It will readily be imagined that a community based so exclusively on
mutual fellowship does not fulfil its tasks very satisfactorily, and that the
system is not particularly workable. There are many indolent or refractory
members who do not fulfil their duties towards the community for lack of
coercion from without, and because the only pressure that can be brought to
bear upon them, the shame of falling short in the eyes of their kinsfolk or in
public opinion, is of no avail against their cowardice or perverse obstinacy.
Moreover, individual liberty of action is too little restricted by a due regard
for the interests of the community. There is nothing to prevent a man from
undertaking on his own account a raid which may kindle a flame of war that
will wrap his whole tribe in its conflagration and even spread beyond. Or
by the admittance of a stranger into his tent and his clan, which he regards
as an obligation of honour and of religion, he may involve his tribe in great
difficulties by imposing on them the burden of henceforth protecting the said
stranger against his pursuers who may be seeking to arrest him for some crime.</p>

<p>But a more fruitful source of discord than individual cases of friction is
the competition between the tribe and the clan. There is no doubt that
these polar associations did not spring from the same root, but differ in their
very origin; the tribe probably coalesced under the rule of a communistic
matriarchal system (endogamous), while the clan is based on an aristocratic
patriarchal system (exogamous). At the present time the tribe is regarded
as merely an expansion of the clan, both being held together by the same
paternal consanguinity. But the degrees of political kinship vary, the ties
of blood have not the same force throughout; they act far more effectively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
in the smaller circle than in the larger. The individual stands in no direct
relation to the tribe; his connection with it is through the intermediate
links of the clan and the family; his membership in the community is conditioned
by his membership of the subordinate groups. As a rule, therefore,
the individual finds that his skin is nearer to him than his shirt whenever the
interests of tribe and clan diverge. And it goes without saying that this is
very often the case.</p>

<p>The defects of the system are to some extent compensated by certain
rudiments of government to be found among the Arabs. There is a leading
aristocracy; the clans have their chief, and a head chief, the <i>said</i>, is at the
head of every tribe. The position of all these chiefs depends upon voluntary
recognition of the fact that they are fitted to hold it by their personal qualities
and their fortune. They are spontaneously appointed by the common
voice, without election or any similar process, and though there is an inclination
to make the authority hereditary and the sons reap the advantage of
gratitude felt toward their fathers, yet each man must, by his own ability,
anew make good his claim to the honours he has inherited if he is to remain
in power and public esteem. The word of these chieftains carries most
weight in the assemblies in which they meet every evening to talk, dispute,
and deliberate. The <i>said</i> gives the casting vote. He decides, for instance,
when the tribe shall start on its migrations and when it shall encamp.
Generally speaking, however, the chiefs and the <i>said</i> have no advantage
over the rest in privilege, but only in obligation. Among the Arabs <i>noblesse
oblige</i> is no empty phrase, but a substantial truth. The nobles must distinguish
themselves above the rest in the duties incumbent upon all; they must
take on their shoulders the burden which others pass by, and out of their
own abundance make good the deficit caused by lack of corporate feeling in
the multitude. They must be liberal in all things; must not spare their
blood in feud nor their goods in peace; they must entertain the stranger,
maintain the widow and the orphan, feed the hungry and help the debtor to
pay. The principal share in bearing the common burden falls to the <i>said</i>.
In return he receives the fourth part of all booty, but he nevertheless often
spends his whole fortune for the common stock; his position brings him
honour and reputation, but never gain, and therefore does not procure
him the envy of baser natures. But his most important duty is to maintain
the unity of the tribe and to check the disintegration to which it is liable
from individual selfishness and the particularism of the various clans. He is
there to step into the breach, as the biblical phrase has it. He is the born
mediator and peacemaker.</p>

<p>For all that, he can only negotiate and apply moral pressure. He is but the
first among equals; he has great authority but no supreme power, and in
the last resort that is not enough either for the external or internal affairs of
the community. In war there is no thought of compulsory service, no idea
of discipline, of absolute command and obedience. If one clan will not go
out with the rest, it separates from them and hardens its heart against their
mockery and contempt. If the men will not follow their leader, he sometimes
has recourse to an attempt to put them to shame by setting up his
sword and threatening to fall upon it, unless he is obeyed. Danger from
without is, however, the readiest means of inducing them to submit to a
single will, whereas the lack of a central sovereign authority is much more
sorely felt in internal affairs.</p>

<p>The only function of the ancient community, apart from self-defence, is
the maintenance of peace within its own borders, and the means to this end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
is the law. The Old Testament, for instance, knows nothing of administration
as a function of the state; to rule is to judge, and the generic term
for ruler is judge.</p>

<p>The Arabs are not without law, though with them its limits are wider
and less strictly defined than with us and include the decision of questions
which do not lead to impeachments and law-suits, but refer to duties, not
rights.</p>

<p>They also have judges who administer justice. Disputes between fellow
tribesmen are brought under discussion in the daily palaver and are there
settled without any legal formalities. But international disputes, <i>i.e.</i>, matters
disputed between members of different tribes, may also be settled
by law, if both parties agree to choose an arbitrator to whom they will
refer the decision. Anyone may undertake this office; in difficult cases a
seer or priest is frequently applied to, or some other man who enjoys general
confidence and has a reputation for exceptional wisdom. The arbitrator
sometimes makes the parties swear to accept his verdict, whatever it may
be, but his business is merely to discover and interpret the law, and he
has no power to enforce it. The disputants consequently apply to the judge
merely to learn the rules of the law, not to sue for and obtain their rights.
His judgment has no legal force and does not entail the execution of the
sentence, with which, in fact, it has nothing to do.</p>

<p>An instance of what appears to us so singular a state of things, may
make the matter clearer. Shortly before Mohammed’s arrival at Medina, a
man of that city went to law with a Bedouin from the neighbourhood before
a wise woman about a sum of money, <i>i.e.</i>, camels. The woman decided in
favour of the man of Medina; he was a well-known person, Suwaid, the son
of Samit, by name. When they came to the parting of the ways, Suwaid
said to the Bedouin, “Who will be surety that thou wilt pay me the camels?”
The other promised to send them as soon as he reached home. But Suwaid,
not satisfied with this, wrestled with his debtor, threw him, and bound him.
He then carried him off to Medina and kept him in custody, until his kinsmen
redeemed him by paying him what he owed.</p>

<p>Criminal jurisdiction, as we understand it, is rendered impossible by the
absence of a supreme authority, a magisterial tribunal. Although fidelity
to one’s kindred is a moral law and the violation of it a sin, yet the Arabs
have not reached the abstract conception of crime against the community at
large, still less of punishment inflicted by the community&mdash;since for the
community to cast off a troublesome or unworthy member is not, strictly
speaking, a punishment. They only recognise private offences, and the
punishment of these is the business of the individual. There is no official
process of investigation with the coercive methods of vigorous cross-examination.
If anything is stolen, the owner proclaims his loss aloud and lays
the thief under a curse unless he restores the missing article, and all his
accomplices likewise, unless they tell what they know of it. If murder or
manslaughter has been committed by an unknown hand and this or that
man is suspected of being the perpetrator, his clan takes an oath of
purgation for him, which may, however, be counterbalanced by an oath
to the opposite effect on the part of the dead man’s clan.</p>

<p>The punishment of an offence is of course left to the sufferer. It is his
business to see how he can best get compensation for the wrong done him
and to seek for help wherever he may find it. He is not forbidden to take
vengeance into his own hands, nor is there any compulsion to make him have
recourse to law instead of so doing. The individual may, of his own free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
will, refrain from violent measures, if he pleases, and may enter into negotiations,
which are then conducted on the basis of a legal principle, of an inner
material law. But if, instead of avenging himself, he resorts to legal proceedings,
the question is never one of the punishment of a crime,&mdash;which,
indeed, could hardly be settled by agreement between the contending
parties,&mdash;but merely of compensation for a loss. Compensation can be
given for everything for which vengeance might be exacted. All crimes
are treated in the same manner by the law, and assessed as economic damage.
Every loss of honour, property, or life can be appraised by agreement; they
all have their price in camels. Vengeance is not thereby appeased, but if
revenge is relinquished, the law demands no more.</p>

<p>The worst and most serious crime is bloodshed. Malice or accident, war
or peace, make no difference to this. Its natural and primary consequence
is blood-revenge. This is, in the first place, the duty of the next heir, but
it quickly extends to others, for the clan of the slayer does not desert him,
but takes his part, and consequently also the slain man’s whole clan naturally
helps the avenger against them. The result is a state of war between the two
clans, which finds expression in occasional murders, often at long intervals.
All members of the clan are considered accomplices; they espouse one
another’s quarrel as in war, and fall victims to vengeance without distinction
of persons. Every new member is a fresh motive for vengeance, and thus
revenge incessantly breeds revenge. Thus blood-revenge necessarily results
in blood-feud between the clans. It has been supposed that blood-feuds
are only carried on between two hostile tribes, and not between kindred
clans belonging to the same tribe, as that would constitute a breach of tribal
unity. But the preservation of tribal unity is a moral axiom only, and incapable
of keeping the centrifugal forces under effective control. The clan’s
right of feud is undisputed, and, as a matter of fact, blood-feuds are carried
on also within the tribe as well as without. The duty of vengeance is more
vividly realised than duty to the tribe; it is a sacred primary law which takes
precedence of all political considerations. Even if brother slays brother in
the same clan, the result is a blood-feud, though the cases on record are as
a rule supposititious, not real, just as similar cases are treated by the Greeks
as tragic problems in the <i>Oresteia</i> and the <i>Œdipodeia</i>.</p>

<p>Law can be substituted for revenge in murder as in other crimes, that is
to say, even blood-guiltiness can be paid off in money, <i>i.e.</i>, in camels. This
is done by agreement between debtor and creditor or between the clans of
both; and when the agreement is brought about, the source of the blood-feud
is estopped. In quarrels within the tribe it is the duty of the chiefs,
and of the head chief more particularly, to induce the disputants to consent to
an accommodation by law. They then negotiate as between two belligerent
powers; they can only mediate for peace, not impose it. Sometimes they are
successful, sometimes not. Mecca and Medina furnish the best instances of
both results. Very often the disputants do not make peace until their
strength is utterly exhausted. Then the balance-sheet is drawn up, the
debit and credit in dead and wounded compared, and the difference made up
in camels.</p>

<p>But it is obvious that in this case the incongruity between what vengeance
demands and what the law accords is too glaring. The Arabs are
keenly alive to this fact, and it is not considered honourable to accept camels
as satisfaction for a murder&mdash;to sell blood for milk, as their phrase goes.
Vengeance is far better appeased by positive amends on a less unequal scale,
by blood for blood, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. This is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
made by peaceful means, and that is what is called <i>talio</i>. The criminal
is not sheltered by his own people, but is handed over to the avenger
that he may requite him for what he has done. If the heritage of
vengeance has passed to a child, the execution is often deferred till his
majority.</p>

<p>By this means the quarrel is confined to the parties immediately concerned,
the clans are not implicated, blood-revenge does not degenerate into blood-feud,
nor does it exceed in the heat of passion the measure of strict retribution.
As a matter of fact talio appears to have been common in cases
of mere bodily injury. An amusing instance is recorded in the life of
Mohammed. At the battle of Bedr he ranged his men in a long straight
row, forming them into line with the shaft of a spear. In so doing he struck
somewhat heavily upon the body of a man whose figure projected beyond
the straight line, and the individual, whose name and race are exactly recorded,
complained of his violence. Mohammed promptly offered his own
body and said, “Take unto thyself the talio,” which, however, the other
magnanimously declined to do. From this we see that also a military
commander in the exercise of his official functions differs in nothing from a
private person in the eyes of the law. Imagine a scene of this sort between
officer and private on a modern parade-ground!</p>

<p>If, however, it is not a question of satisfaction for mere corporeal injuries,
but of blood for blood, the situation becomes far more difficult; for if mulct
is unwillingly taken, talio is far more unwillingly given. It is the direst
disgrace for any clan to give up one of its members, no matter what his
crime, into the hands of another clan which intends to put him to death;
rather will they slay him themselves. Hence the talio, though an efficacious
means of keeping blood-revenge within bounds and blunting its dangerous
edges as far as the peace and unity of the tribe are concerned, cannot be
practically enforced in the ancient Arabic community, because it has no
sovereign power over the tribe.</p>

<p>The first Arabic community with sovereign powers was established by
Mohammed in the city of Medina, not upon the basis of blood, which
naturally tends to diversity, but upon that of religion, which is equally
binding on all. There for the first time the talio becomes effective, there
it can be enforced. The community, at the head of which God stands, and
the prophet as God’s representative, has power to deliver the shedder of
blood over to the avenger, and it is the duty of the community to see that
this is done. “In the talio ye have the life,” says the <i>Koran</i>; and a
commentary is provided by the hideous anarchy, conjured up by blood-feuds,
which prevailed in Medina before the coming of Mohammed&mdash;life was
then indeed impossible. And in another place the <i>Koran</i> says, “If a
man have slain one person unlawfully, it is as if he had slain all men.”
In other words the murder of an individual is to be regarded as a crime
committed against the whole community, and the whole body must see to it
that lawful vengeance may have its course. The execution of vengeance is,
however, still left to the rightful avenger; and he is at liberty to exercise
his right or renounce it, either freely or for a price. The talio is not yet a
punishment, it is only the transition stage to it from revenge.</p>

<p>Originally even Islam knew nothing of the capital punishment publicly
inflicted, of a ritual execution by the community and its officers, at
least not in cases of murder or manslaughter. Even in the earlier caliphate
there were enormous difficulties in the way of the execution of a Moslem
who had not shed innocent blood. Apart from the talio the official<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
infliction of capital punishment was hardly possible, for as long as Arab
sentiment survived, the people could not grasp the distinction between an
executioner and a murderer. A change did not take place until with the
accession of the Abbasids the Iranians took the reins of government from
the Arabs and brought with them Iranian conceptions of state and law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Hebrews, near kinsmen of the Arabs, arrived at
just conceptions of capital crime and capital punishment fifteen hundred
years earlier than they. According to the Hebrew view, the guilt of sin,
which is held to be an offence against the Deity, weighs upon the whole
community, until the actual perpetrator of the crime is extirpated or purged
out of its midst. The sentence of death is carried out by the whole community
and takes the form of stoning, its characteristic features being that
every man of the congregation takes part in it and casts his stone. Murder
and manslaughter, indeed, are not as yet classed among the offences against
God, for which capital punishment at the hands of the community is due;
bloodshed is in the main a private wrong still, and its punishment is left
to the injured person. But it is not associated with blood-feud between
clans, and the criminal is not protected by his family. Blood-revenge is
tamed already and restricted by law to what we know as the talio. The
shedder of blood is abandoned by his family, the heir and avenger may pursue
and slay him. Should he take refuge in a sanctuary, he is safe if he
has shed blood by mischance only. Otherwise the sanctuary affords him no
protection. It is the right and duty of the community, represented by its
elders, to drag him away from the altar and hand him over to the avenger.
The act of slaughter is always left to the latter; the ceremonial infliction of
capital punishment, execution by the congregation, is never the penalty
assigned for murder or manslaughter. But the avenger is not allowed to
take a ransom for the murderer or give him his life. For here the idea
insinuates itself that bloodshed is not only a wrong and injury done to the
individual, but a crime, that is to say an offence against God. The murderer
has sinned also against the Deity, and his guilt lies upon the whole community,
until they are rid of him.</p>

<p>Thus the religious obligation of the community, to wash away the blood
shed within its borders, goes hand in hand with the individual obligation of
vengeance. If the murderer cannot be discovered, vengeance is impossible;
but a symbolical ceremony is substituted for the purification of the community,
and the city within whose borders a man is found dead by an
unknown hand must slay a cow in place of the murderer.</p>

<p>We see that among the Hebrews the ideas of crime and punishment had
their root in religion; the crime is an offence against God, and its punishment
is the purging of the community from this offence; execution is the
only real punishment, and must be distinguished from talio on the one hand
and mere chastisement on the other.</p>

<p>Among the Arabs the religious root of the penal law has withered away
and nothing but human vengeance is left. This can hardly be the ancient
conception. Vengeance itself is in its origin not a human passion merely,
it is likewise a religious duty. True, this duty was originally believed to
have been imposed, not by the Almighty, but by a demon. And this demon
was the wrathful spirit of the murdered man himself, who would not let his
clan rest until they had given him to drink the murderer’s blood for which
he thirsted. We can still find traces of this belief among the Arabs.
Amongst them the avenger of blood is under a solemn vow, exactly like the
man who has to offer sacrifice or fulfil any other religious duty; he may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
not wash nor comb his hair, nor drink wine, with many other prohibitions
of the same kind. As he accomplishes the act of vengeance, he must call
upon the name of him for whom he takes it, in a brief form of words; then
he is free and returned from the state of sanctification and uncleanness to
that of cleanness and common life; exactly like a sacrificer after he has
made a sacrifice.</p>

<p>But these are petrified remains, as it were, of a motive that has no present
potency. The poetry which has come down to us invariably speaks
only of the ungovernable rage of the avenger, not of the person to be
avenged; of burning pain in the breast of the survivor, which demands relief
at any price; and of the shame which weighs him down as long as the murderer
still treads the earth alive. Moreover&mdash;and this is a particularly striking
point&mdash;religion has not retained any influence upon actual law amongst
the ancient Arabs, apart, perhaps, from the process of inquiry by curse
and oath.</p>

<p>Ancient Arab law is singularly profane, dry, and formless; it is throughout
a matter of bargain and contract, for even the penal law operates only
through compensation and payment.</p>

<p>Such, in brief outline, is the picture of the Arabic community, a community
devoid of supreme authority and executive power. We are fond of
calling it patriarchal, but what do we mean by the phrase? Of the amenities
of family life we find no trace, nor any trace of patriarchal guardianship.
Each man has to give his help, if anything is to be done. There is more
scope in such a community for the display of courage, self-sacrifice, and
brotherly kindness than in our own, where the state seems to work like a
machine for which we have merely to provide the fuel. It is a pity, however,
that so fair an opportunity is not put to the fullest use. In critical cases,
the corporate feeling on which the whole system depends is often shown by
but few. There are hitches and difficulties everywhere, though in the desert
the conditions of life are very simple, narrow, and easy to understand, its
interests very uniform. No progressive civilisation can develop in this
fashion; the desert is enough in itself to render development difficult.
These weak foundations will bear no aspiring superstructure. Not even
individual liberty, as we understand it, reaps advantage from the absence
of the coercion of the state. For if the sense of kinship be too weak to control
the wicked and force the indolent to fulfil the duties incumbent upon
them, yet it is strong enough to prevent the growth of intellectual freedom
in circles that possess and exercise it. Such liberty can only thrive in a state
which, like Noah’s ark, contains all kinds of animals and lets them do as they
please, not in a society of kinsmen which lays a spell upon their members
from within, though it can impose no coercion from without.</p>

<p>The communities of Europe started, as there are many evidences to
show, from primitive conditions like those in which the Arabs of the desert
have remained. It is well that we should bear this in mind, and so estimate,
<i>quantæ molis erat romanam condere gentem</i>, what amount of labour was required
to create a stable system of law, independent of the individual.</p>

<h3 id="PARTHIANS_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII. THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW IN ISLAM</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Written Specially for the Present Work</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Dr. I. GOLDZIHER</span></p>

<p class="center">Professor in the University of Vienna, etc.</p>

<p>In studying the lines along which Islam has developed we are confronted
with a singular antithesis within the faith itself. It is the outcome of a
revolutionary movement which arose to declare war against the past of the
Arab nation and of all other nations which it subdued by the ruthless sword
of Islam. Yet it had scarcely taken the first step in its career, before investing
with little short of sacramental importance an idea so wholly alien to the
spirit of subversion and revolution that it seems to us rather a palladium of
the most rigid conservatism. This is the idea of the sunna.</p>

<p>Sunna means traditional usage, or custom hallowed by ancestral use, by
practice transmitted through past generations. He who violates this custom
trespasses against the Holy of holies, against something far above any article
of a legal code drawn up with all the mature consideration and cool deliberation
of the judicial mind; he had sinned against the pious reverence due to
the days of old. This is the view which underlies the sanctity of the sunna.
Translated into legal phraseology sunna might accordingly be denominated
right by custom, but a better idea of its meaning may be gained by comparing
it with the <i>mores majorum</i> or <i>usus longævus</i> of the Romans. For the
determining factor in it is not its established character but the high esteem
in which it has been held from remote antiquity.</p>

<p>All this (to return to the proposition from which we started) is little in
accord with a system which originated with a prophet of revolution who
could not say, as Jesus said of himself, that he was “not come to destroy
but to fulfil”&mdash;at least, not as far as the traditional institutions of the
Arabs were concerned. Mohammed does, indeed, represent himself as restoring
what has been lost, as bringing back the golden age of religion to man,
the rule of the <i>din Ibrahim</i> (the religion of Abraham) which had been lost
by corruption and wickedness, and obscured by gross heathenism on its own
native soil (for according to Mohammed the Kaaba at Mecca is the temple of
Abraham and Ishmael). But it is not this pretension which will enable us
to grasp the significance of the idea of the sunna in Islam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>Amazing as it may sound, and accustomed as we are to associate the idea
of the sunna with the sheikhs who keep jealous watch over the holy places
of Islam, sunna is not primarily an Islamite word, nor is the idea it expresses
peculiar to Islam. It is deeply rooted in the ethical sentiment of the very
heathenism which the prophet arose to overthrow. Sunna is an idea which
Islam adopted from Arab heathenism, and which, in the change of meaning
it underwent in this new sphere, became one of the main pillars of the new
system.</p>

<p>The conception involved in the sunna, as defined at the beginning of this
essay, represents the heathen Arab’s ideal of life and the primitive idea of
laws and morals in tribal life. In this respect there was no difference between
the two classes which went to make up the sum total of the Arab world,
between the Bedouins and the dwellers in towns. The <i>mores majorum</i> were
their law and their religion. The customs of their forefathers were their
dogmas; the practices that had come down to them from the remote past
were their sacraments. To infringe these was criminal sacrilege. If the
cult of tribal fellowship and regard for the duties arising out of this association
constitute the sum total of morality, how much more imperatively did
the principle apply to the maintenance of a supersensual fellowship with the
generations of the past.</p>

<p>Hence, in the persecution with which the world of Arab heathenism
received his preaching, Mohammed was not confronted by opponents who
defended the old state of things by arguments based on religion, or wielded
the weapons of serious controversy to refute his doctrines. The heathen
Arabs had but one argument against the message proclaimed to them by the
visionary of Mecca&mdash;it was an innovation. He represents his heathen fellow-countrymen
as putting forward this argument against himself in exactly the
same manner as he represents the heathen nations of old as hurling it at
their prophets. “If one saith to them, ‘Obey the laws which Allah sends
you,’ then they say, ‘We follow the customs of our fathers.’ If one saith to
them, ‘Come and adopt the religion which Allah hath revealed to his ambassador,’
they answer, ‘We are satisfied with the religion of our fathers.’
When the evil-doers commit an evil deed they say, ‘Thus we saw it done by
our fathers, it is Allah who commands such things.’ But they say, ‘We
found that our fathers were on this road and we tread in their steps.’ Speak
and say&mdash;do I not proclaim to you a better thing than that whereat ye found
your fathers?”</p>

<p>This plea, which constitutes, so to speak, the methodology of the struggle
of the heathen against the prophet, is, as it were, a constant element that
pervades all the laments of the <i>Koran</i> over the stubbornness of the heathen.
They hate the prophet because he insults their forefathers, who were likewise
his own. He is lacking in filial piety. And the touchstone of his error is
his antagonistic attitude towards the remote past. To the heathen his
idols are dear as “heritages from the worthies who have bequeathed this
inheritance.”</p>

<p>Only a few decades elapsed before Islam had its own sunna. The element
of antiquity in this case was, of course, a figment; it anticipated for its justification
the generations yet to be born, who should look up to this new
standard as to something hallowed by tradition. It had no warrant in the
actual experience of successive generations which had already regarded it as
inviolable.</p>

<p>The <i>Koran</i>, the oldest and most authoritative document of the Islamite
movement, is not a book which offers to the believer a comprehensive body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
of religious instruction sufficient to satisfy all inquiries. What it pre-eminently
does is to predispose religious sentiment to the acceptance of the
religion which arose on this foundation. Nor is it more complete if regarded
as a statutory guide in questions of law, since it takes note of only a small
and very limited department of juridical needs. What it does is to predispose
ethical sentiment in favour of the new aspects in which social life and
the legal relations it involves are to be considered.</p>

<p>While these sentiments gave precision to the form of these new standards,
investing them with the character of divinely instituted laws, their
substance drew its nourishment from alien sources, from new views, which
were a consequence of the great career in history upon which the new
Islamite community entered soon after it came into existence. Much fresh
territory was conquered. It was impossible that contact with foreign elements
should fail to implant fresh ideas in the Semitic mind, singularly
receptive as it is&mdash;ideas which were destined to give its final shape to the
faith of Islam with which its adherents had embarked on their conquering
career.</p>

<p>Without the effect produced on the religious sentiment of Mohammedans
by questions that arose under the influence of Greek philosophy, there
would have been no formulated system of Mohammedan dogmatics, and in
like manner the first impulse towards the creation of a Mohammedan system
of law was given by contact with two great spheres of civilisation&mdash;the
Romaic and the Persian, the former in Syria and the latter in Mesopotamia.
It has already been remarked that the influence of Roman law on the
sources of a legal system in Islam is attested by the very name given to
jurisprudence in Islam from the beginning. It is called <i>al Fikh</i>, reasonableness;
and those who pursue the study of it are designated <i>Fukaha</i> (singular
<i>Fakih</i>). These terms, which, as we cannot fail to see, are Arabic translations
of the Roman (<i>juris</i>) <i>prudentia</i>, and <i>prudentes</i>, would be a clear indication
of one of the chief sources of Islamite jurisprudence, even if we had no
positive data to prove that this influence extended both to questions of the
principle of legal deduction and to particular legal provisions.</p>

<p>The positive laws of the <i>Koran</i>, and the few legal decisions made in particular
cases by the first caliphs and other companions of the prophet at
Medina in the early days of Islam, together with all the legal customs retained
from heathen days, were inadequate to serve for the state of things brought
about by the great conquests and immense expansion of the Moslem empire.
Even if all elements which had previously and all which had come into being
to meet the primary requirements of the new Mohammedan society had
sufficed for an Arab commonwealth on an Islamite basis, the sum total of it
all would nevertheless have been inadequate to the needs of the new political
fabric of Islam in countries subject to entirely different economic and
social conditions, and amidst conquered peoples whose lives were ordered on
a systematic legal basis. When Islam subdued such ancient civilised
peoples with the edge of the sword, it could not impose upon them the
primitive conditions of life under which it had come forth into the wide
world from the steppes and oases of Arabia. It could mould the results of
the historic past into harmony with its own religious sentiment; but it could
not destroy it, if for no other reason than that it had nothing to put in its
place. Hence it had to leave many institutions in the conquered countries
substantially as it found them. The problem first presented itself in Syria,
the first halting-place of the victorious advance of Islam. The <i>Koran</i> and
its earliest applications in practice made provision for family and matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
rights and rights of succession, but proved worse than meagre when
applied to the privileges attaching to landed property in a great agricultural
state, or to the laws of contract and obligation which, in the countries conquered
by Islam, were ordered by the fixed standards of Roman law. In
this department the heads of the new government had to take over very
many ordinances of Roman law.</p>

<p>But, even apart from the adoption of legal standards, Roman law exercised
a notable influence upon the legal thought of the new intruders into a
country whose jurists had been trained in the scientific jurisprudence of the
school of Berytus. The influence exercised by the Roman legal methods on
the system of legal deduction in Islam is a more important factor in the history
of Moslem civilisation than even the direct adoption of particular points
of law. By what systematic rules or what devices can deductions be drawn
from positive laws, written or traditional, which shall apply to newly arising
cases at law and to the decision of legal questions for which the positive
written law provides no answer? In dealing with this juridical problem the
Arab <i>Fukha</i> took their stand entirely upon the instruction they had gained
from circles familiar with the work of Rome in the domain of law. The
dualism of written law (Arabic, <i>nazz</i>) and unwritten law is a mere reflection
of the dualism of <i>leges scriptæ</i> (<i>chakhamim</i>), and <i>leges non scriptæ</i>. Just so,
about half a century before, the Jewish jurists (a word which in its legal
application is likewise a translation of the Roman term <i>jurisprudentes</i>) had
been moved by their intercourse with the Romans to make the hitherto unrecognised
distinction between the <i>tora she-bitche-thab</i>, or written law, and
the <i>tora she-be’al-peh</i>, or oral law.</p>

<p>The application of principles and rules borrowed from the methodology
of Roman jurisprudence first made it possible to extend the limited legal
material supplied by the <i>Koran</i> and the old decisions which were accepted as
the basis of the law, to other departments of juridical activity, of which
these authorities had had no prevision. The <i>ratio legis</i> (<i>illa</i>), the principle
of presumption was applied to analogies (<i>kyas</i>) in words and things; nay,
just as Roman legal practice gave great weight to the <i>opinio prudentium</i> in
legal deduction, so the Islamite <i>prudentes</i> assumed the prerogative of an
authoritative subjective <i>opinio</i>; for <i>ra’j</i>, as it is called in Arabic, is a literal
translation of the Latin term. Of all these principles (which are not exhausted
by the examples just cited) none more strikingly demonstrates the
profound influence of Roman law on the development of legal opinion in
Islam, than that which is known in Arabic as <i>maclaha</i> or <i>istilah</i>,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
public weal and regard for the same. The significance of this principle lies
in the license it grants to the interpreter of the law to apply the legal standard
in the manner best fitted to serve the public weal and interests. Here we
recognise the Roman standard of the <i>utilitas publica</i>, which gives the interpreter
of the law the right, by interpretation, an application to wrest a plain
and unambiguous law into something quite different from its original meaning,
in the interests of the public weal.</p>

<p>Such principles, derived from foreign instructors, served for the deduction
of Mohammedan law, as soon as the teachers of the people felt the
necessity of withdrawing the domain of law from the capricious action of
the sovereign and his instruments in the administration and judicature, which
had free play by reason of the meagreness of positive legal matter based
upon generally recognised authority. The Islamite jurists declared that the
conclusions at which they had arrived on the basis of these principles
(which, as we have seen, were no part of Islam) were in harmony with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
true spirit of Islam, the rightful outcome of its original character. This
phenomenon, which early came to maturity and was widely accepted in
Mohammedan theological circles as legal and of indubitable authority, is of
profound importance to our historic estimate and judgment of Islam. Whatever
the ignorant men who stood by its cradle may have thought to be the
meaning of the new word which they were charged to proclaim to the oriental
world, the first step which conquering Islam took on its victorious career
taught it to accommodate itself to an alien spirit, and to mould its own
intellectual heritage by influences which seem absolutely heterogeneous to a
superficial observer.</p>

<p>In more than one point of its doctrinal fabric, Islam in its early days
was a borrower. Its founders were anxious, it is true, to avoid the appearance
of appropriating other men’s property. But loudly as they trumpet
the principle, “Be different from them in all things” (<i>Chalifuhum</i>) the
reference here being chiefly to Jews and Christians, their documents are
crammed with borrowings from the Scriptures of the very confessions which,
on their own assertion, it was their leading principle to oppose. The stubborn
antagonism of Islam to the rest of the world, its inflexible protest
against the influence of foreign elements, is an illusion which historical study
of the movement must dissipate if it is to rise to a scientific comprehension of
this great historic phenomenon.</p>

<p>Though contact with the Romæi was the influence which caused the first
seeds of law in Islam to germinate, we must not overlook another side upon
which Islam in its early days came into direct contact with a foreign national
element, the influence of which was very important in the development of
its legal system. We refer to its contact with the people and the religion
of Persia. This can be traced back to pre-Islamite times, and even Mohammed
himself was not absolutely free from the influence of the religious ideas
of the Parsees (<i>madjus</i>, magians), whom he classes in the <i>Koran</i> with Jews
and Christians, and contrasts with the heathen as confessors of more favoured
religions.</p>

<p>But Persian nationality did not become a formative element in Islam
until the latter subjugated the geographical sphere of the old Parsee religion,
and by the right of conquest imposed the faith of the prophet of Mecca
and Medina upon the followers of Zoroaster. The Mohammedan occupation
of ’Irak is one of the most telling factors in the religious and juridical development
of Islam.</p>

<p>Persian theologians carried their inherited views into the new religion
they had adopted, the conquering power enriched the poverty of its own
religious store with elements supplied by the experience of a profound
religious life, such had been a native growth among the conquered Persians
from of old. Hence it is hardly possible to overestimate the importance of
the part played in the development of Islam by the spiritual movement which
came to birth in ’Irak and is associated with the schools of Bacra and Kufa.
In analysing the elements of which Islam is composed we are not surprised
to find many of Persian origin, the outcome of this connection.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>These influences are brought into fullest play by the great revolution
which befel the Moslem empire in about the hundred and twenty-eighth year
of its existence&mdash;the fall of the Omayyads and the usurpation of the sceptre
of the caliphs by the Abbasids. The worldly spirit which had guided the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
policy of the fallen dynasty&mdash;a spirit genuinely Arab, devoid of any real comprehension
of the religious aims and the transcendental interests of Islam&mdash;now
makes way for a theocratic bias, which drew its ideas in the main from
the character of the Persian “divine monarchy.” It is the Sassanid spirit in
an Islamite garb. The indifferentism of the ruling powers gives place to
the encouragement of religious tendencies. The religious tolerance of earlier
days is at an end. Sectarianism, pietism, harsh dogmatism, and, linked
with them, the persecuting spirit&mdash;are the dominant notes of public life.
Disputations concerning matters of religion impress their characteristic stamp
upon the intellectual tendencies which find favour in high places. Opposing
religious parties come into the field and frame their subtlest arguments.</p>

<p>Moreover, this was the opportune moment for working up into practical
juridical systems the suggestions in the department of jurisprudence derived
in earlier days from Roman law. In the second century of the Hegira,
Islamite jurisprudence enters upon the classic period of its efflorescence and
completion. The scene of its glory is the scholarly world of Mesopotamia,
which sheds its rays upon every quarter of the Mohammedan empire. Even
such advances in the sphere of law as come to light outside this birthplace
of systematised jurisprudence are the fruit of the intellectual movement on
the soil of the ancient empire of Persia. And even the demonstrations of
antagonism to the aspirations which took shape there (for it aroused tremendous
opposition) are affected by its influence.</p>

<p>Abu Hanifa (699-767) of Kufa, the grandson of a Persian, is recognised
in Islam as the father of that jurisprudence which, by the employment of the
free speculative method already described, found ways and means to make
provision for the whole vast sphere of legal activity (which includes both
law and religious ceremonial) out of the scanty stock of positive legal documents.
This completion of the legal system of Islam was arrived at by
laborious development along the lines of its main principles, by modification
of the method evolved in some particular school, by open contravention of
the fundamental ideas of some particular tendency, and, lastly, by deliberate
compromise between antagonistic lines of thought. It was reached with
a rapidity which is characteristic of all the intellectual creations of Islam.
It is a singular feature of the whole literature of Islam that everything
reaches its prime with amazing rapidity, only to decline as rapidly. In the
fourth century of the Hegira every branch of Arabic literature had come
to full maturity, to flourish for a brief while, and enter upon its period of
decadence about the beginning of the sixth.</p>

<p>By the end of the third century (ninth century <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) jurisprudence had
reached its classic prime. Leaving out of account some other heads of
schools who soon retire from the scene, there are four men in particular to
whom it does honour as to its founders and fathers, four men whose disciples
represent the main currents which flow side by side through the construction
of Islamite law: (1) Abu Hanifa (died 767), the true representative of the
’Irak method; (2) Malik b. Anas (died 795), the most celebrated imam in
the prophet’s city of Medina; (3) Mohammed b. Idris al-Shafii, a pupil of
the latter (died 820), most famous for his educational work in Egypt, where his
sepulchral chapel (in the Karafa at Cairo) is reverenced by the natives as a
place of pilgrimage; and (4) Akhmed b. Hanbal (died 855), the pious teacher
of Baghdad, the principal champion and valiant apostle of the old conservative
views in religion, whose tomb in the Harbiah graveyard at Baghdad has, in
the phrase of Guy l’Estrange, the writer of the monograph on the ancient city
of the caliphs, “become the object of a devotion savouring of idolatry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>The views which have been enumerated, borrowed from the method of
legal deduction in Roman law, were not employed to the same extent by all
schools of jurisprudence. While in that of Abu Hanifa the validity of the
<i>opinio</i> goes so far as to accord recognition to the personal inclination of the
administrator of the law, other schools were not disposed to give such free
scope to the subjective judgment. The principle of <i>istiçhab</i> (<i>præsumptio</i>)
was most fully recognised in the school of Shafii; that of regard for the public
weal (<i>istiçlah</i>) in that of Malik.</p>

<p>In the erudite world which busied itself with the theoretical exposition
of the law there were, however, large bodies of scholars, who took up their
parable to proclaim that, generally speaking and on principle, they could not
profess to recognise principles of method which depended for their authority
on the subjective work of the human reason. They would recognise two
things only as the sole basis of legal deduction&mdash;Scripture and tradition;
that is to say, the <i>Koran</i> and the traditions or positive decisions of the
prophet, his companions and their successors, of whom it could be safely
assumed that they had acted and given judgment in the spirit of the founder
of the faith. Only in cases of extreme necessity, and when these authoritative
sources obstinately refused to yield an answer, was it lawful to admit the
authority of <i>ra’j</i> (<i>opinio</i>), or more particularly, of <i>kiga</i> (analogy). These
latter were “like the vulture, the eating of which was permitted as an exception
in time of dearth when other food could by no means be obtained.”
Under normal circumstances it was not permissible to reason; the only right
course was to abide by the letter of tradition, since nothing outside of that
could be set on a par with it. Truth manifests itself not in answer to the
question “What is reasonable?” but in answer to “What did the prophet
say and how did he act?”</p>

<p>Here we find ourselves face to face with the idea of the sunna which had
come down from the Arabs of old (the idea explained at the beginning of
this article), in its most rigid form, but with this difference&mdash;that the
sunna, as now understood, does not look back to a remote antiquity but to a
very recent past. The genuine sunnist only feels solid ground beneath his
feet when he can base his judgment and conduct on the authentic text, or on
well-accredited tradition concerning the words and deeds of the earliest
authorities recognised by the Islamite world. Of all the four schools, the
Hanoblalite, the one founded by the youngest teacher, was that in which this
rigid view found most favour. In modern times it has been brought into
prominence as a principle of government by the puritanical state of the
Wahabees, the “<i>Tempelstürmer von Hocharabien</i>,” as they are called by Karl
von Vincenti in a historical novel in which he describes their proceedings.</p>

<p>It is, however, an easy thing to say, “Tradition and nothing but tradition!”
But what if, with the best will in the world, no answer can be
wrung from tradition to the most pressing questions of ordinary life? The
judge must give judgment; the shepherd of souls must lay down rules for
his flock on questions which hourly crop up for decision in a state of life
ordered by religious laws in even the most trifling details; and in doubtful
cases the mufti must be able to expound the meaning of the divine law with
no uncertain voice. What, then, if Scripture and tradition be dumb, and no
effort can draw forth the least enlightenment from them? Where all the
sources of tradition ran dry, men had to make concessions, whether they
would or not, to individual opinion and the right of speculative interpretation.
This led to the rise of a school of thought which endeavoured to
reconcile the two sharply antagonistic tendencies. It was absolutely necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
to discover a middle course between excessive subjectivism and rigid
traditionalism, and to define accurately the juridical spheres of the two
conflicting elements. It was necessary to discover rules, in accordance with
which speculative methods might be used to supplement tradition in the
work of legal deduction, and to set up standards for the right use of traditional
data in the correct formulation of the law. This work of reconciliation
was done by the founder of the second school on the list, at Shafii.</p>

<p>Moreover there was another point of view from which the systemisation
of the use of speculation as a source of law on the one hand and of tradition
on the other proved an imperative necessity. If, in the one case, it was
requisite to curb the arbitrary exercise of the subjective reason, it was no
less necessary to check the rank growth of traditional matter, which, as it
increased, hampered more and more the use of authentic tradition. The
one-sided partisans of the sunna needed traditional matter for the establishment
of such a legal system as they desired to see. Nor was any refutation
of their theses, nor any opinion advanced against them, in their eyes worth
discussing unless it could appeal to the authority of tradition. As a result,
where no traditional matter was to be had, men speedily began to fabricate it.
The greater the demand, the busier was invention with the manufacture of
apocryphal traditions in support of the respective theses.</p>

<p>For the verification of didactic records, whether sacred or profane, Islam
has adopted a singular form, which imparts to Islamite tradition a character
altogether peculiar to itself, to which we can find no parallel (at least in
such a mature and consistent shape) in any other literature. This is the
<i>hadith</i>. The word <i>hadith</i> means simply communication, or narrative. If
any such narrative is to be put forth with pretensions to authenticity the
actual text must be preceded by what is called the <i>sanad</i> or <i>isnad</i> (literally,
‘support’). This enumerates in correct and unbroken sequence the authorities
who have handed the narrative down from mouth to mouth, from the
last person responsible for its circulation up to its original author. The
examination of this sanad allows free and unbiased criticism the opportunity
of judging whether these men on whose authority any particular narrative
has been passed from mouth to mouth and from generation to generation,
and set down as an actual occurrence, were persons deserving of full credit.</p>

<p>From this point of view an unbroken chain of oral tradition constitutes
a surer and more valuable guarantee of authenticity than any written document,
whether contemporary or based upon contemporary records. Even if
a written document bears all the outward tokens of authenticity, it must be
able to show a consistent sanad reaching in uninterrupted sequence from the
first author to the last teller of the tale, if its claim is to be admitted. Every
narrative and every matter of tradition, without regard to its quantitative or
qualitative importance, must be set forth with its “genealogy.” This
genealogy is the sanad. In theological matters, more particularly, it is the
backbone without which no record can stand upright.</p>

<p>The literature of historic research also avails itself of this form of verification.
Readers of the classic work of Muhammed Jarir al-Tabari, the
“father of Islamite history” are familiar with this method of historic authentication.
Each record takes the form of an appendage to a chain of tradition
which reaches back to some direct authority, and to this chain the record is
appended in the very words of the first narrator. It sometimes happens
that a record of the same event occurs in narratives that are traced back to
different authorities, and not merely in different words and with trifling
variations. The facts themselves are represented in a totally different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
fashion, or the narratives of different authorities set them or their accompanying
circumstances in a different light. All these divergent narratives
are simply placed side by side, in a manner which cannot be compared with
the different authorities for the narratives of the Pentateuch; for, unlike the
latter, the traditional records of Arab history are not anonymous. On
the contrary, they owe their distinctive character to this circumstantial
system of authentication and the enumeration by name of the successive
vouchers for their truth. Again, they show no trace of an attempt on the
part of any editor to reduce conflicting accounts to harmony; they are simply
set side by side, instead of being welded together. This circumstance
has greatly facilitated the critical study of the periods from which such parallel
narratives date. Wellhausen has recently given to the world a masterly
study, in which he skilfully discriminates between the various points of view,
and the particular bias of each of the authorities for the narrative of the
victory at Tabari (<i>Skizzen und Vorarbeiten</i>, VI).</p>

<p>The same state of things prevails in the statements of tradition in matters
of law and religion. Each statement, cast into the traditional form,
and relying for authentication in the first instance upon the testimony of
an actual eye-witness, professes to show the practice of the prophet at certain
times of prayer, or what judgment was given by him or his companions
in certain legal questions. During the first century of Islamism divergencies
of practice in minor details of law and worship had grown up in different
congregations of believers. Every one of these divergent forms can
appeal to the authority of a formal and well-attested traditional account,
with a sanad in which the names of the most trustworthy witnesses are
adduced in support of theses diametrically opposed to one another.</p>

<p>In order to obviate this incongruity, there soon developed in Islam a
science of textual criticism, a study in which Islamite erudition outstripped
that of Europe by several centuries. Its object was to decide the claims of
the various authorities, to judge of the degree of credit to be given to each,
to weigh the possibility that sectarian or party tendencies might have
vitiated the <i>bona fides</i> of men otherwise above reproach. The climax of
this work of criticism is to be found in certain systematised compilations
of traditions, the editors of which start with the definite object of sifting
what appears to them authentic out of the vast body of obviously spurious
material. The most famous of these compilations are those of Buchari
(died 870) and Muslim (died 875). The general consent of Islam presently
invested these compilations with canonical authority.</p>

<p>Other works of the same kind were also held in great honour. In course
of time other compilations from among those made in the ninth century were
added to the first two, and in these the sifting of tradition was carried out
upon the most liberal principles. From the thirteenth century onward, six
codices have been recognised as the sources of authentic traditional records.
Out of these theological science gathers the evidence of tradition in questions
of law, and with the <i>Koran</i>, they constitute the canonical literature of Islam.</p>

<p>Judged by a scientific criterion, only a very small part, if any, of the
contents of these canonical compilations can be confidently referred to the
early period from which they profess to date. Minute study soon reveals
the presence of the tendencies and aspirations of a later day, the working of
a spirit which wrests the record in favour of one or other of the opposing
theses in certain disputed questions.</p>

<p>What we gather from these traditional authorities is by no means a
homogeneous system of instruction. The voice of thoroughly well-attested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
tradition can be quoted in support of the most diverse, nay, of the most contradictory
teachings on certain points of ritual and law. This is one of the
principal causes of divergences of practice in minor details of religious usage
and of the law. These differences, together with the vexed question of the
use of the subjective factor in legal deduction, lie at the root of the controversies
between the four great schools of law (the founders of which we
have already enumerated) which occupy the whole field of orthodox Islam.
These schools are in accord upon the great fundamental doctrines of religion,
and the outward differences in practice are not regarded as elements of division.
The Islamites consider them of equal validity, with equal claims to
pass for orthodox.</p>

<p>Sunnite Islam early formulated and put into the mouth of Mohammed
the doctrine that “Differences of opinion in my congregation are to be regarded
as tokens of the mercy of God.” Like Lessing, the Islamites think
that all trees cannot have the same bark. It is therefore a great error, and
one which leads to a total misunderstanding of the whole character of Islam,
to describe these four currents of thought, or <i>madsahib</i>, as the Mohammedans
call them, as “sects,” or use such language as recently appeared in a widely
circulated journal, which said: “We need only recall the question which
resulted in a schism in Islam, as to whether ablutions should be begun at the
elbow or at the wrist.” (<i>Münchener Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, Beilage No. 209,
Sept. 12th, 1901.) The fact that these differences of ritual exist cannot be
denied. But schisms take their rise from dogmatic and juridical questions
of a far more radical character, and lie far beyond the sphere of the points
in controversy between the four schools of the law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the present state of the Islamite world, orthodoxy
is wholly confined to these four main schools of thought, which rank as the
right and recognised modalities of correct religious usage and of the practical
interpretation of the law. To borrow an image from philology, they
and they alone are legitimate dialects of the one fundamental language of
Islam. <i>Quintum non datur.</i> Zealous religious associations, which take
their stand on the fundamental principles of Islam, yet cannot be classed in
either of these four categories, are looked upon as dissenters of dubious
character, although they themselves regard it as their one object in life to
purify Islam and imbue it with fresh vigour. They are styled <i>chums</i> or
<i>chawamis</i>, from a word meaning “fifth,” to mark their independence of the
four parallel streams of orthodoxy. Such, for example, are the Senussis, a
religious association in north Africa, whose proceedings are at present engaging
the serious attention of the leaders of French colonial policy. They
are not adherents of the school of Malik, which predominates in north
Africa, and are therefore regarded as <i>chawamis</i> by the Moslem “high
churchmen” of the locality.</p>

<p>One of the cardinal points of orthodox Islam in every sphere of religion
and law is the “general consent and practice of the whole body of believers”
(<i>consensus ecclesiæ</i>). The Arabic name for this mighty principle is <i>ijma</i>.
The general consent of the whole body of believers on certain points of
faith and law is of binding force, no less than Scripture and tradition. Nay,
even the authority of all the primary sources of the Islamite religious system,
as historically developed, derives its force from this consensus, which
constitutes its principal title to recognition. The acceptance of such compilations
of tradition as are received as canonical, and subsequently of the
standard juridical codes, rests on no other legal basis than this general consent
of the whole body of believers, by which they have been invested with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
binding authority. This great principle&mdash;which, if any man fail to realise
and rightly appreciate the development of Islam and Islamite institutions,
must remain a sealed book to him&mdash;was in process of time defined as the
doctrine accepted alike by all the four orthodox schools of thought. This
definition of the idea of ijma is the result of the self-imposed limitation of
the principle itself in practical application. In process of time it was found
impossible to verify this general consent by any other method than by confining
it to the well-defined sphere of the schools of the law. Thus this
free intellectual outlook lost the vital force which might have made it an
element of far-seeing and liberal development.</p>

<p>The recognition of the principle of the ijma as a fundamental element
is a point on which all schools of orthodox Islam are at one. The <i>schi’itic</i>
branch of Islam, however, has not adopted it as one of its fundamental doctrines.
It takes its stand on blind obedience to authority. In its eyes the
visible and invisible heads of the whole body of true Islamites are the successors
of ’Ali, the infallible imams. They alone are the legitimate rulers of
the faithful, both as the rightful chiefs of the state, and as the true organs
of the divine will in matters of law and doctrine. To this sect every historical
and political development of Islam, which derives its title to authority
from the consensus, is a usurpation and an impiety which the last imam,
the Mahdi who is yet to come, will bring to a terrible end. From their
point of view the recognition of the consensus is mere error and heresy, and
the sentiment and will of the whole body of believers is not entitled to be
recognised as a criterion. In its stead they set the word of the infallible
imams, the lawful successors of the prophet and the interpreters of his will,
which is one with the divine will. Thus perishes the last remnant of the
autonomous authority which the body of orthodox Islamites have assumed
by the recognition of the principle of the consensus.</p>

THE VALUE OF THE CRUSADES IN THE LIGHT OF
MODERN HISTORY</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Rev. WILLIAM DENTON, M.A.</span><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The interest with which we continue to regard the Crusades is, in its
way, as significant as the enthusiasm which led to their being undertaken.
It is easy now to underrate the dangers which they averted, and to forget
the obligations which the civilised world is under to Charles Martel, to the
crusaders, to Don John of Austria, and to John Sobieski; yet to these men we
owe it that Europe is not now Bulgaria; and that Italy, France, and England&mdash;that
the whole of the countries from the Black Sea to the Atlantic, from
Archangel to Sicily, are not trampled upon and desolated as Syria is at this
moment. It is not easy for us to comprehend how recently the terror once
inspired by the Turk has ceased. We need to be reminded that down to the
time of the Stuarts the English and Irish channels were infested with Turkish
corsairs, and our ports blockaded by Turkish ships of war in quest of
slaves.</p>

<p>It is only indeed since the eighteenth century that collections of money to
redeem English captives from the intolerable evils of Turkish slavery have
ceased to be made in our churches. That such captivity is not national, and
only occasional and individual, is one of the inestimable fruits of the Crusades.
At the time when these were undertaken, the whole of Asia, from the borders
of China to the Bosporus, was subject to the Turks; and had these
people been able to cross into Europe, and to hold the countries on the south
of the Danube as a basis for military operations four hundred years earlier
than they succeeded in doing, or indeed at any time whilst the Moors of
Spain and of Sicily were in their full career of victory, the whole of Europe
would inevitably have fallen under the dominion of the Moslems, and industrial
progress had been stayed and civilisation extinguished. So recently
has this danger disappeared that, at the close of the seventeenth century, a
statesman as calm and unenthusiastic as Richelieu seriously meditated the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
renewal of the Crusades, in order to avert the evil which even then threatened
to overwhelm the civilised world. That he did so is sufficient to remove
from the leaders and projectors of the Crusades the charge of being moved
by blind, unreflecting fanaticism.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, indeed, the school of historians represented by
Voltaire and Gibbon, which discredited all great efforts of past times when
prompted by religious zeal, treated the Crusades with unphilosophical ridicule.
It was an easy task to do this. We are arrested in every page of their history
with the lamentable consequences of popular ignorance, with the selfishness
of many of the leaders, with the record of personal ambition and
unworthy jealousy which too frequently hindered the success of these expeditions.
The whole, however, is not heard when we have listened to accounts
of popular fanaticism, of royal insincerity, of military ambition, and of papal
selfishness, which chequer the history of the crusaders, as these faults
chequered the history of Europe at the time when the Crusades were undertaken.
The great, the imminent danger of Turkish conquest inspired the
minds of the people with fear before it induced the chieftains to combine in
averting the danger. The anarchy which pervaded Europe in the ages of
feudalism was, indeed, the chief source of danger in any advance of the
Turkish forces, and this was in a great measure cured by the enthusiasm
communicated from the people to the great landed proprietors, who, more
jealous of their independence than careful of their obligations to their sovereign,
yet felt the necessity of union and of submission to military discipline
in the hour of peril.</p>

<p>The First Crusade was one undertaken without sufficient leaders, with but
little preparation, and with smaller knowledge of the countries to be traversed
and the difficulties to be overcome. It was a spontaneous effort of terror
and of zeal, in which we can at least satisfy ourselves of the reality of the fear
which pervaded all men, and which we know to have been warranted by the
merciless character of the horde which, having subjugated Asia, was on its
way to attempt the subjugation of Europe. Men have come to see that the
Turk is now what he always has been; it is well to bear in mind the correlative
truth that essentially he always was what he is now; and when we recall
the massacres of the last century, the bloody scenes of Scio and Aleppo, of
Jiddah and of Lebanon, of Bosnia and Bulgaria, we may without effort understand
what he was when Asia lay at his feet, and Europe was terrified at the
rumours of his attempt to cross the Bosporus.</p>

<p>It is too much the practice of those who would deprecate our obligation
to those who strove to arrest the progress of the Turks, to dwell upon some
instances of magnanimity or of mercy, of justice or chivalrous conduct which
lighten up the pages of the history of the Saracens, and to insinuate from
these instances that the Turks possess the same claim to our admiration.
The Turks, however, are not Arabs, neither have they ever manifested any of
that care for intellectual pursuits which has thrown a lustre on the career
of the Saracens of Asia and the Moors of the Spanish peninsula. On the
contrary, the career of the Osmanli has been marked by deeds of savage
atrocity, by an indifference to the obligations of oaths, as well as by his
brutal ignorance and hatred of all intellectual progress; and at the present
day his inferiority to the Arab in statesmanship, in honesty, and in intelligence
is acknowledged.</p>

<p>In estimating the effects of the Crusades the reader will do well to
consider the calm judgment and weighty words of a modern historian, who
thus expresses our obligation to the devotion and bravery of those men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
whose deeds are here briefly recorded. “By arresting the progress of the
Turks,” says Mr. Sharon Turner, “by stunning them with blows which a less
hardy, fanatic, and profuse population could not have survived, and by protracting
their entry into Europe until its various states had grown up into
compacted kingdoms&mdash;until the feudal system had been substantially overthrown;
until free government and humanising law had blended and concentrated
individual energy and self-will into national unity and co-operating
strength; until polity had begun to be a science, and that order of men whom
we both venerate and revile (statesmen and politicians) had everywhere
arisen&mdash;the crusaders preserved Europe from Turkish desolation, if not
from conquest. And when the Ottoman power, recovering from its alarms
by their discontinuance, arose in renovated vigour to a new struggle for
the sovereignty of Europe in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries&mdash;though it conquered Greece, overran Hungary, Transylvania,
Moldavia, and Wallachia, attempted Russia and Poland, and endangered
Vienna&mdash;yet the rest of Europe had then become prepared to resist its
further progress; and has hitherto successfully kept it at bay, notwithstanding
its mighty population and desperate fanaticism, until its political infirmity
has become decided, the period of its decrepitude arrived, and its
political dissolution has commenced.”</p>

<p>Since these words were written the decrepitude of the Turks has increased,
though their cruelty has not diminished; nay, in some instances, the
periodical massacres of their Christian subjects, which have ever marked
the rule of this race, have been carried out more systematically and with
circumstances of greater horror than of old. We are, indeed, no longer
alarmed at the progress of their arms, and have no fear for our own safety.
We may gather, however, from the accounts of the suffering of the Christians
dwelling in our own days among the Turks, how natural it was for
Europe to be terrified at the prospect of their invasion; and from the generous
indignation which thrilled the heart of England at the time of the
Armenian massacres, we may faintly understand why it was that Europe
was so moved at the rude eloquence of Peter the Hermit, as he detailed the
sufferings of the Christians of Asia Minor when first subjected to the yoke
of the Turk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1096-1291 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Pilgrimages to Jerusalem, which were in use from the earliest ages of
Christianity, had become very frequent about the beginning of the eleventh
century. The opinion which then very generally prevailed, that the end of
the world was at hand, induced vast numbers of Christians to sell their possessions
in Europe, in order that they might set out for the Holy Land, there
to await the coming of the Lord. So long as the Arabs were masters of
Palestine, they protected these pilgrimages, from which they derived no
small emoluments. But when the Seljukian Turks, a barbarous and ferocious
people, had conquered that country (1075), under the caliphs of Egypt,
the pilgrims saw themselves exposed to every kind of insult and oppression.
The lamentable accounts which they gave of these outrages on their return
to Europe excited the general indignation, and gave birth to the romantic
notion of expelling these infidels from the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Gregory VII was the projector of this grand scheme. He addressed
circular letters to all the sovereigns of Europe, and invited them to make
a general crusade against the Turks. Meantime, however, more pressing
interests, and his quarrels with the emperor Henry IV, obliged him to defer
the projected enterprise; but his attention was soon recalled to it by the
representation of a pilgrim, called Peter the Hermit, a native of Amiens in
Picardy. Furnished with letters from the patriarch of Jerusalem to the
pope and the princes of the West, this ardent fanatic traversed the whole of
Italy, France, and Germany; preaching everywhere, and representing, in the
liveliest colours, the profanation of the sacred places, and the miserable condition
of the Christians and poor pilgrims in the Holy Land. It proved no
difficult task for him to impart to others the fanaticism with which he was
himself animated. His zeal was powerfully seconded by Pope Urban II, who
repaired in person to France, where he convoked the council of Clermont
(1095), and pronounced, in full assembly, a pathetic harangue, at the close
of which they unanimously resolved on the Holy War. It was decreed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
all who should enrol their names in this sacred militia should wear a red
cross on their right shoulder; that they should enjoy plenary indulgence,
and obtain remission of all their sins.</p>

<p>From that time the pulpits of Europe resounded with exhortations to the
Crusades. People of every rank and condition were seen flocking in crowds
to assume the signal of the cross; and, in the following year, innumerable
bands of crusaders, from the different countries of Europe, set out, one after
another, on this expedition to the East. The only exception was the Germans,
who partook but feebly of this universal enthusiasm, on account
of the disputes which then subsisted between the emperor and the court of
Rome. The three or four first divisions of the crusaders [comprising about
273,000 men, under the leadership of Peter the Hermit, Walter de Pexejo,
and Walter the Penniless] marched without order and without discipline;
pillaging, burning, and wasting the countries through which they passed.
Most of them perished from fatigue, hunger, or sickness, or by the sword of
the exasperated nations whose territories they had laid desolate. [The four
thousand that crossed the Bosporus were annihilated by Kilidj Arslan, the
sultan of Rum, or Iconium.] To these unwarlike and undisciplined troops
succeeded regular armies, commanded by experienced officers, and powerful
princes: the Crusades proper were inaugurated.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>From this time on (see Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Crusades) the Christian kingdom
in Palestine may be considered a part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1291, when
the sultan Khalil takes Acre and drives the last of the Christians out of Syria.</p>

<h5>THE COUNTY OF ANTIOCH (1099-1268 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>A vassal state of the kingdom of Jerusalem founded 1099 by the crusaders with <b>Bohemond
of Tarentum</b> at its head. Bohemond is captured by the Turks (1105)
and Tancred goes to Antioch to govern. Bohemond released the following year.
The emperor Alexius claims Antioch, but Bohemond successfully resists him. He
goes to Europe, and after various adventures dies there in 1111. Tancred dies the
following year. For eight years the principality is united to the kingdom of Jerusalem,
but in 1126 Baldwin II of Jerusalem gives it to <b>Bohemond II</b>. <b>Bohemond
III</b> rules 1162 to 1201. Some of the princes of Antioch rule in virtue of their wives’
right to the throne. In 1268 Bibars, the sultan of Egypt, captures Antioch and the
principality comes to an end.</p>

<h5>THE COUNTY OF TRIPOLIS (1109-1289 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>A vassal state or county of the kingdom of Jerusalem from 1109, when the city of
Tripolis is captured by the crusaders and <b>Raymond of Toulouse</b> placed at its
head. The Christians rule until 1289, when it falls into the hands of Kalaun, the
sultan of Egypt, who destroys the city.</p>

<h5>THE COUNTY OF EDESSA (1097-1146 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>In 1097 <b>Baldwin I</b>, brother of Godfrey de Bouillon, in consequence of a quarrel with
Tancred, leaves the main body of the crusaders, conquers Edessa, and founds the
vassal state of that name.</p>

<p><span class="year">1100</span> Baldwin, made king of Jerusalem, gives Edessa to his cousin, <b>Baldwin (II) de
Bourg</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">1118</span> Baldwin II is made king of Jerusalem and <b>Jocelyn (I) de Courtenai</b> takes his
place in the county of Edessa. He wins many victories over the Saracens.</p>

<p><span class="year">1131</span> <b>Jocelyn II</b> succeeds.</p>

<p><span class="year">1144</span> Capture of Edessa by Zenki, emir of Mosul.</p>

<p><span class="year">1146</span> Jocelyn regains Edessa, but the same year Nur ad-Din, Zenki’s son and successor,
retakes and destroys it. End of the county of Edessa. On account of this event
Bernard of Clairvaux preaches.</p>

<h5>THE SECOND CRUSADE (1147-1149 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p><span class="year">1146</span> In the council of Vézelay, Louis VII of France assumes the cross; the emperor, Conrad
III, follows his example some months later.</p>

<p><span class="year">1147</span> The armies of Conrad and Louis start from Ratisbon and Metz respectively, marching
through Hungary to Asia Minor. The German army in advance is nearly annihilated
in Phrygia through the treachery of the Byzantine emperor, Manuel, by
Masud I, the sultan of Rum. Conrad, with the remnant of his force, joins the
French army along the seacoast.</p>

<p><span class="year">1148</span> Unsuccessful attempt of the Second Crusade to capture Damascus and Askalon. Conrad,
in ill health, returns to Constantinople and thence to Germany.</p>

<p><span class="year">1149</span> Louis returns to France. Bernard is reproached for the failure of the crusade.</p>

<h5>THE THIRD CRUSADE (1189-1192 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>The disastrous defeat and capture of Guy de Lusignan at Tiberias by Saladin, and
the latter’s capture of Jerusalem (1187), reawakens the crusading spirit. Gregory
VIII urges a new crusade.</p>

<p><span class="year">1188</span> William, archbishop of Tyre, induces Henry II of England and Philip Augustus of
France to assume the cross.</p>

<p><span class="year">1189</span> Death of Henry. Richard (I) Cœur de Lion eagerly pursues his father’s project.
The emperor, Frederick (I) Barbarossa, sets out with an army through Hungary.
He spends the winter at Hadrianopolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p><span class="year">1190</span> Frederick reaches Asia Minor with assistance of Isaac Angelus, and takes Iconium.
Sudden death of Frederick. His son, Frederick of Swabia, leads the crusaders to
Acre, which Guy de Lusignan, having regained his liberty, is besieging. Richard
and Philip Augustus start by sea for the Holy Land. They spend the winter in
Sicily, quarrel and are reconciled.</p>

<p><span class="year">1191</span> Richard stops at and conquers Cyprus on his way to the Holy Land. Richard and
Philip arrive at Acre. Death of Frederick of Swabia during the siege. Surrender
of Acre. Compact with Saladin, binding him to surrender the true cross and pay
a large sum. Philip quarrels with Richard and returns to France.</p>

<p><span class="year">1192</span> Richard makes unsuccessful attempt to take Jerusalem. He relieves Joppa and
makes truce with Saladin entitling pilgrims to visit Jerusalem unmolested, for a
short time. Richard sails for England. Is shipwrecked near Aquileia. Seized
near Vienna by Leopold, duke of Austria, who surrenders him (1193) to the
emperor, Henry VI. Henry imprisons him, and he is released for a large ransom
in 1194 and returns to England.</p>

<h5>THE FOURTH CRUSADE (1195-1198 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>The Knights of St. John start in 1193 to organise a crusade. They are encouraged
by Pope Celestine III, who hopes that the troublesome emperor Henry VI will be
induced to take part in it. Henry also promotes the project, but has no idea of
taking part in it.</p>

<p><span class="year">1195</span> Henry makes use of one division of the crusaders to conquer the kingdom of Sicily.
Two other divisions proceed to Syria.</p>

<p><span class="year">1196</span> Defeat of the Turks between Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<p><span class="year">1197</span> The crusaders besiege the fortress of Thoron, but make a disgraceful retreat on hearing
of the approach of an army from Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="year">1198</span> The Saracens capture Joppa. The count of Montfort concludes a three years’ truce
with the Saracens. The crusade leaders return to Europe.</p>

<h5>THE FIFTH CRUSADE (1201-1204 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>Pope Innocent III, on his elevation (1198), with the assistance of Fulk of Neuilly,
preaches a new crusade.</p>

<p><span class="year">1201</span> The company is organised by Simon de Montfort, Walter de Brienne, and Geoffrey
de Villehardouin. Boniface of Montferrat chosen leader. The party proceeds
to Venice. Treaty between Venice and the leaders for transportation. Unable to
pay sum demanded, the doge, Dandolo, agrees to remit the sum lacking if the
crusaders will capture for him the town of Zara, taken from Venice by the king of
Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="year">1202</span> Arrival at Venice of Alexius, son of the deposed emperor Isaac, with whom the crusaders
agree to restore Isaac. In spite of Innocent’s protests the fleet sails for Zara,
which is taken and handed over to Venice.</p>

<p><span class="year">1203</span> The crusaders proceed to Constantinople. Alexius III, the reigning emperor, tries in
vain to treat with them. Flight of Alexius. The crusaders enter Constantinople.
Isaac II and Alexius IV restored. Constant friction between the emperor and crusaders
leads</p>

<p><span class="year">1204</span> to the second capture of Constantinople. The reigning family driven out. Foundation
of the Latin Empire of Romania and other states. (See “History of the Eastern
Empire.”)</p>

<h5>THE CHILDREN’S CRUSADE (1212 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>Seems to have arisen from the idea that the main cause of the failure of the Crusades
was the sinfulness of the pilgrims. None but the innocent and pure could accomplish
the mission. In 1212, thirty thousand boys and girls set out under the boy,
Stephen, and twenty thousand from Germany, under Nicholas, a peasant boy. Most
of them perish on the way; and others are sold into slavery.</p>

<h5>THE SIXTH CRUSADE (1217-1229 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>When Innocent III crowns Frederick II emperor, in 1215, he extracts a promise from
Frederick to conduct a crusade, but the latter, seeing in the pope’s action a plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
to outwit him in the then imminent struggle between emperor and pope, defers his
departure.</p>

<p><span class="year">1217</span> Andrew II of Hungary, incited by Honorius III, Innocent’s successor, sets out for
Jerusalem. He is joined by the king of Cyprus. The crusaders visit Tyre, Sidon,
Acre, and Tripolis, but the Saracens make such havoc in their numbers that Andrew
returns to Hungary.</p>

<p><span class="year">1218-1221</span> Jean de Brienne’s expedition to Damietta. (See “Kingdom of Jerusalem”).</p>

<p><span class="year">1228</span> Frederick II, after many disputes with the pope, sets out for Jerusalem, the throne of
which he claims through his marriage to Yolande.</p>

<p><span class="year">1229</span> Frederick makes treaty with the sultan Kamil, receiving Jerusalem and other places.
Frederick crowns himself king of Jerusalem, and returns to Europe.</p>

<h5>THE SEVENTH CRUSADE (1239-1240 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>Gregory IX preaches a new crusade (1238). The sultan Kamil dies that year.</p>

<p><span class="year">1239</span> King Thibaut of Navarre leads an army to Palestine to break the truce made between
Kamil and the Templars. The sons of Kamil defeat him and capture Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="year">1240</span> Richard, earl of Cornwall, proceeds to Acre, and receives offers of peace from the
sultan of Egypt. Jerusalem, and other places in Palestine, are restored to the
Christians. Richard returns to England.</p>

<h5>THE EIGHTH CRUSADE (1248-1254 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>In 1244, Jerusalem is taken by the Khwarizmians, who have been driven from their
own country by Jenghiz Khan. This leads to a new crusade. Louis IX of France,
in a fit of illness, vows to lead an army against the Khwarizmians.</p>

<p><span class="year">1248</span> Departure of Louis and his crusaders. He winters in Cyprus.</p>

<p><span class="year">1249</span> Louis proceeds to Egypt, and takes Damietta. He then sets out for Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="year">1250</span> Battle of Mansura. Defeat and capture of Louis by Turan Shah, sultan of Egypt.
Louis is released by the restoration of Damietta, and the promise to abstain from
further hostilities. The crusaders return to St. Jean d’Acre. Louis remains four
years in Syria, fortifying Acre and other cities, and</p>

<p><span class="year">1254</span> returns to France.</p>

<h5>THE NINTH CRUSADE (1270-1272 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>)</h5>

<p>In 1260, the mamelukes, on the death of their sultan, Ibeg, choose Bibars as his successor.
This vigorous warrior at once drives the Khwarizmians out of Syria, and
takes Damascus and Jerusalem from them. He then proceeds to exterminate the
Christians in Syria; in consequence of which, by 1267, a new crusade has been
planned. Louis IX of France, and Prince Edward of England, are among those
who assume the cross.</p>

<p><span class="year">1268</span> Antioch surrenders to Bibars without a siege.</p>

<p><span class="year">1270</span> After many difficulties in raising an army, the crusaders sail for the Holy Land. Stopping
at Sardinia, Louis changes his plans, and proceeds against the king of Tunis.
Shortly after reaching there, the plague breaks out, and Louis dies. King Charles
of Naples arrives and makes a truce with the Tunisians, who pay him tribute. The
whole fleet returns to Europe, and is wrecked on the Sicilian coast. Charles plunders
the French and Genoese vessels. Prince Edward leaves the French in Tunis,
and proceeds to Acre.</p>

<p><span class="year">1271</span> Edward besieged at Acre by Bibars. Edward drives the mamelukes away and seizes
Nazareth. An attempt is made to assassinate Edward.</p>

<p><span class="year">1272</span> Edward concludes a ten years’ truce with Bibars, and returns to Europe.</p>

<p><span class="year">1274</span> Gregory X fails in an attempt to start a new crusade. Bibars and his successors,
Kalaun and Khalil, continue the process of exterminating the Christians.</p>

<p><span class="year">1289</span> Tripolis is taken. Acre is the last important possession of the Christians. The mamelukes
make a treaty with the king of Cyprus.</p>

<p><span class="year">1291</span> Capture of Acre by Khalil. Tyre, Berytus, and other towns, submit. The last possessions
of the Christians in the Holy Land are abandoned. Other crusades are
planned, but they are never carried to execution. The military orders are eventually
suppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[306-1096 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The history of the Middle Ages presents no spectacle more imposing
than the Crusades, in which are to be seen the nations of Asia and of
Europe armed against each other, two religions contending for superiority,
and disputing the empire of the world. After having been several times
threatened by the Moslems, and a long time exposed to their invasions, all at
once the West arouses itself, and appears, according to the expression of a
Greek historian (Anna Comnena), to tear itself from its foundation, in order
to precipitate itself upon Asia. All nations abandon their interests and
their rivalries, and see upon the face of the earth but one single country
worthy of the ambition of conquerors. One would believe that there no
longer exists in the universe any other city but Jerusalem, or any other
habitable spot of earth but that which contains the tomb of Jesus Christ.
All the roads which lead to the Holy City are deluged with blood, and present
nothing but the scattered spoils and wrecks of empires.</p>

<p>In this general confusion we may contemplate the sublimest virtues
mixed with all the disorders of the wildest passions. The Christian soldiers
have at the same time to contend against famine, the influence of climate,
and enemies the most formidable; in the greatest dangers, in the midst of
their successes and their constant discords, nothing can exhaust either their
perseverance or their resignation. After four years of fatigue, of miseries,
and of victories, Jerusalem is taken by the crusaders; but as their conquests
are not the work of wisdom and prudence, but the fruit of blind enthusiasm
and ill-directed heroism, they create nothing but a transient power.</p>

<p>The banner of the cross soon passes from the hands of Godfrey de Bouillon
into those of his weak and imbecile successors. Jerusalem, now a
Christian city, is obliged again to apply for succour to the West. At the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
voice of St. Bernard, the Christians take arms. Conducted by an emperor of
Germany and a king of France, they fly to the defence of the Holy Land;
but they have no longer great captains among them, they have none of the
magnanimity or heroic resignation of their fathers. Asia, which beholds
their coming without terror, already presents a new spectacle. The disciples
of Mohammed awaken from their apathy; they are at once seized with a frenzy
equal to that which had armed their enemies; they oppose enthusiasm to
enthusiasm, fanaticism to fanaticism, and in their turn burn with a desire
to shed their blood in a religious war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1147-1532 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The spirit of discord which had destroyed their power is no longer felt
but among the Christians. Luxury and the manners of the East weaken
the courage of the defenders of the cross, and make them forget the object
even of the holy war. Jerusalem, which had cost the crusaders so much
blood, falls again into the power of the infidels, and becomes the conquest
of a wise and warlike prince, who had united under his banner the forces of
Syria and Egypt.</p>

<p>The genius and fortune of Saladin inflict a mortal blow upon the ill-assured
power of the Christians in the East. In vain an emperor of the
West, and two kings celebrated for their bravery, place themselves at the
head of the whole powers of their states to deliver Palestine; these new
armies of crusaders meet everywhere with brave enemies and invincible
barriers, and all their united efforts produce nothing but illustrious disasters.
The kingdom of Jerusalem, for whose ruins they contend, is no longer anything
but a vain name; soon even the captivity and the miseries of the Holy
City cease to inspire the sentiments of piety and enthusiasm that they had
given birth to among the Christians. The crusaders, who had taken up arms
for its deliverance, suffer themselves to be seduced by the wealth of Greece,
and stop short to undertake the conquest of Constantinople.</p>

<p>From that time the spirit of the crusaders begins to change; whilst a
small number of Christians still shed their blood for the deliverance of the
tomb of Jesus Christ, the princes and the knights are deaf to everything but
the voice of ambition. The popes complete the corruption of the true spirit
of the crusaders, by urging them on, by their preaching, against other Christian
people, and against their own personal enemies. The holy wars then degenerate
into civil wars, in which both religion and humanity are outraged.</p>

<p>These abuses of the Crusades, and the dire passions which had mixed
themselves with them, plunge Europe in disorder and anarchy; when a
pious king undertakes once more to arm the powers of the West against the
infidels, and to revive among the crusaders the spirit which had animated
the companions of Godfrey. The two wars directed by this pious chief are
more unfortunate than all the others. In the first, the world is presented
with the spectacle of a captive army and a king in fetters; in the second,
that of a powerful monarch dying in its ashes. Then it is that the illusion
disappears, and Jerusalem ceases to attract all the attention of the West.</p>

<p>Soon after, the face of Europe is changed; intelligence dissipates barbarism;
the Crusades no longer excite the same degree of enthusiasm, and the
first effect of the civilisation it begins to spread is to weaken the spirit of
the fanaticism which had given them birth. Some few useless efforts are at
times made to rekindle the fire which had burned so fiercely in Europe and
Asia. The nations are so completely recovered from the pious delirium of
the Crusades, that when Germany finds itself menaced by the Mussulmans
who are masters of Constantinople the banner of the cross can with difficulty
gather an army around it; and Europe, which had risen in a mass to attack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
the infidels in Asia, opposes but a feeble resistance to them on its own
territories.</p>

<p>Such is, in a few words, the picture of the events and revolutions which
the historian of the Crusades has to describe.</p>

<p>We do not now require much sagacity to discover in our ancient chronicles
what is fabulous and what is not. A far more difficult thing is to reconcile,
upon some points, the frequent contradictory assertions of the Latins,
the Greeks, and the Saracens, and to separate, in the history of the Crusades,
that which belongs to religious fanaticism, to policy, or to human passions.</p>

<p>In an age in which some value is set upon an opinion of the Crusades, it
will be first asked if the wars of the Crusades were just. Upon this head
we have but little to answer. Whilst the crusaders believed that they were
obeying God himself by attacking the Saracens in the East, the latter, who
had invaded a part of Asia possessed by Christian people, who had got possession
of Spain, who threatened Constantinople, the coasts of Italy, and
several countries of the West, did not reproach their enemies with making an
unjust war, and left to fortune and victory the care of deciding a question
almost always useless.</p>

<p>We shall think it of more importance here to examine what was the
cause and the nature of these remote wars, and what has proved to be their
influence on civilisation. The Crusades were produced by the religious and
military spirit which prevailed in Europe during the Middle Ages. The
love of arms and religious fervour were two dominant passions which, mingling
in some way, lent each other a mutual energy. These two great principles,
united and acting together, gave birth to the holy war; and carried,
among the crusaders, valour, resignation, and heroism of character to the
highest degree of eminence. Some writers have seen nothing in these great
expeditions but the most deplorable excesses, without any advantage to the
ages that succeeded them; others, on the contrary, maintain that we owe
to them all the benefits of civilisation. It is not, at present, our business to
examine these two conflicting opinions. Without believing that the holy
wars have done either all the good or all the harm that is attributed to them,
it must be admitted that they were a source of bitter sorrow to the generations
that saw them or took part in them; but, like the ills and tempests of
human life, which render man better and often assist the progress of his
reason, they have forwarded the experiences of nations; and it may be said
that, after having for a time seriously agitated and shaken society, they
have, in the end, much strengthened the foundations of it. This opinion,
when stripped of all spirit of exaggeration or system, will perhaps appear
the most reasonable.</p>

<h5>EARLY CHRISTIAN PILGRIMAGES</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[306-335 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the earliest ages of the church, a custom had been practised of
making pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Judea, full of religious remembrances,
was still the promised land of the faithful; the blessings of heaven
appeared to be in store for those who visited Calvary, the tomb of Jesus
Christ, and renewed their baptism in the waters of the Jordan. Under the
reign of Constantine, the ardour for pilgrimages increased among the faithful;
they flocked from all the provinces of the empire to worship Jesus
Christ upon his own tomb, and to trace the steps of their God in that city
which had but just resumed its name, and which the piety of an emperor
had caused to issue from its ruins. The Holy Sepulchre presented itself to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
the eyes of the pilgrims surrounded by a magnificence which redoubled their
veneration. An obscure cavern had become a marble temple, paved with
precious stones and decorated with splendid colonnades. To the east of the
Holy Sepulchre appeared the church of the Resurrection, in which they could
admire the riches of Asia, mingled with the arts of Greece and Rome.
Constantine celebrated the thirty-first year of his reign by the inauguration
of this church, and thousands of Christians came, on occasion of this solemnity,
to listen to the panegyric of Christ from

<p>St. Helena, the mother of the emperor, repaired
to Jerusalem, at a very advanced age,
and caused churches and chapels to be built
upon Mount Tabor, in the city of Nazareth, and
in the greater part of the places which Christ
had sanctified by his presence and his miracles.
From this period, pilgrimages to the Holy Land
became much more frequent. The pilgrims, no
longer in dread of the persecutions of the pagans,
could now give themselves up, without fear, to
the fervour of their devotion; the Roman eagles,
ornamented with the cross of Jesus Christ, protected
them on their march; they everywhere
trampled under foot the fragments of idols, and
they travelled amidst the abodes of their fellow-Christians.</p>

<p>When the emperor Julian, in order to weaken
the authority of the prophecies, undertook to
rebuild the temple of the Jews, numerous were
the prodigies related by which God confounded
his designs, and Jerusalem, for that attempt even,
became more dear to the disciples of Jesus Christ.
The Christians did not cease to visit Palestine.
St. Jerome, who, towards the end of the fourth
century, had retired to Bethlehem, informs us in
one of his letters that pilgrims arrived in crowds
in Judea, and that around the holy tomb the
praises of the Son of God were to be heard,
uttered in many languages. From this period,
pilgrimages to the Holy Land were so numerous
that several doctors and fathers of the church
thought it their duty to point out the abuses and
danger of the practice. They told Christians
that long voyages might turn them aside from
the path of salvation; that their God was not
confined to one city; that Jesus Christ was everywhere where faith and good
works were to be found; but such was the blind zeal which then drew the
Christians towards Jerusalem that the voice of the holy doctors was scarcely
heard. As soon as the people of the West became converted to Christianity,
they turned their eyes to the East. From the depths of Gaul, from the
forests of Germany, from all the countries of Europe, new Christians were to
be seen hastening to visit the cradle of the faith they had embraced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[493-750 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>When the world was ravaged by the Goths, the Huns, and the Vandals,
pilgrimages to the Holy Land were not at all interrupted. Pious travellers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
were protected by the hospitable virtues of the barbarians, who began
to respect the cross of Christ, and sometimes even followed the pilgrims to
Jerusalem. In these times of trouble and desolation, a poor pilgrim who
bore his scrip and staff often passed through fields of carnage, and travelled
without fear amidst armies which threatened the empires of the East and the
West.</p>

<p>Illustrious families of Rome came to seek an asylum at Jerusalem, and
upon the tomb of Jesus Christ. Christians then found, on the banks of the
Jordan, that peace which seemed to be banished from the rest of the world.
This peace, which lasted several centuries, was not troubled before the reign
of Heraclius. Under this reign, the armies of Chosroes, king of Persia, invaded
Syria, Palestine, and Egypt; the Holy City fell into the hands of the
worshippers of fire; the conquerors bore away into captivity vast numbers
of Christians, and profaned the churches of Jesus Christ. All the faithful
deplored the misfortunes of Jerusalem, and shed tears when they learned
that the king of Persia had carried off, among the spoils of the vanquished,
the cross of the Saviour, which had been preserved in the church of the
Resurrection. Heraclius, after ten years of reverses, triumphed, and
brought back to Jerusalem the Christians whose chains he had broken.
Then was to be seen an emperor of the East, walking barefooted in the
streets of the Holy City, carrying on his shoulders to the summit of Calvary
the wood of the true cross, which he considered the most glorious trophy of
his victories.</p>

<p>But the joy of the faithful was not of long duration. Towards the beginning
of the seventh century there had arisen, in an obscure corner of
Asia, a new religion, opposed to all others which preached dominion and
war. Mohammed had promised the conquest of the world to his disciples,
who had issued almost naked from the deserts of Arabia. By his passionate
doctrine he was able to inflame the imagination of the Arabs, and on the
field of battle knew how to inspire them with his own impetuous courage.
His first successes, which must have greatly exceeded his hopes, were like so
many miracles, increasing the confidence of his partisans and carrying conviction
to the minds of the weak and wavering. After the death of the
prophet of Mecca, his lieutenants and the companions of his first exploits
carried on his great work.</p>

<h5>JERUSALEM UNDER THE SARACENS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[750-860 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Amidst the first conquests of the Saracens, they had turned their eyes
towards Jerusalem. According to the faith of the Moslems, Mohammed
had been in the city of David and Solomon; it was from Jerusalem that he
set out to ascend into heaven in his nocturnal voyage. The Saracens
considered Jerusalem as the house of God, as the city of saints and miracles.
The Christians had the grief of seeing the church of the Holy Sepulchre
profaned by the presence of the chief of the infidels. Although Omar had
left them the exercise of their worship, they were obliged to conceal their
crosses and their sacred books. The caliph ordered a mosque to be erected
on the spot whereon the temple of Solomon had been built. In the meantime,
the presence of Omar, of whose moderation the East boasts, restrained
the jealous fanaticism of the Moslems. After his death the faithful had
much more to suffer; they were driven from their houses, insulted in their
churches; the tribute which they had to pay to the new masters of Palestine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
was increased, and they were forbidden to carry arms or to mount on horseback.
A leathern girdle, which they were never allowed to be without, was
the badge of their servitude; the conquerors would not permit the Christians
to speak the Arab tongue, sacred to the disciples of the <i>Koran</i>; and the
people who remained faithful to Jesus Christ had not liberty even to pronounce
the name of the patriarch of Jerusalem, without the permission of
the Saracens.</p>

<p class="caption">HOLY SEPULCHRE, JERUSALEM</p>
</div>

<p>All these persecutions could not stop the crowd of Christians who
repaired to Jerusalem, the sight of the Holy City sustaining their courage as
it heightened their devotion. There were no evils, no outrages, that they
could not support with resignation, when they remembered that Christ had
been loaded with chains and had died upon the cross in the places they were
about to visit. The Christians of Palestine, however, enjoyed some short
intervals of security during the civil wars of the Mussulmans. The dynasty
of the Omayyads, which had established the seat of the Moslem empire at
Damascus, was always odious to the ever-formidable party of the Alids, and
employed itself less in persecuting the Christians than in preserving its own
precarious power. Merwan II, the last caliph of this house, was the most
cruel towards the disciples of Christ; and when he, with all his family, sank
under the power of his enemies, the Christians and the infidels united in
thanks to heaven for having delivered the East from his tyranny.</p>

<p>The Abbasids, established in the city of Baghdad which they had
founded, persecuted and tolerated the Christians by turns. The Christians,
always living between the fear of persecution and the hope of a transient
security, saw at last the prospect of happier days dawn upon them with the
reign of Harun ar-Rashid, the greatest caliph of the race of Abbas. Under
this reign the glory of Charlemagne, which had reached Asia, protected the
churches of the East. His pious liberality relieved the indigence of the
Christians of Alexandria, of Carthage, and Jerusalem. The two greatest
princes of their age testified their mutual esteem by frequent embassies: they
sent each other magnificent presents; and, in the friendly intercourse of two
powerful monarchs, the East and the West exchanged the richest productions
of their soil and their industry. There was no doubt policy in the marks of
esteem which Harun lavished upon the most powerful of the princes of the
West. He was making war against the emperors of Constantinople, and
might justly fear that they would interest the bravest among Christian
people in their cause. To take from the Franks every pretext for a religious
war, which might make them embrace the cause of the Greeks, and draw
them into Asia, the caliph neglected no opportunity of obtaining the friendship
of Charlemagne; and caused the keys of the Holy City and of the
Holy Sepulchre to be presented to him.</p>

<p>Whilst the Arabians of Africa were pursuing their conquests towards
the West, whilst they took possession of Sicily, and Rome itself saw its
suburbs and its churches of St. Peter and St. Paul invaded and pillaged by
infidels, the servants of Jesus Christ prayed in peace within the walls of
Jerusalem. To the desire of visiting the tomb of Jerusalem was joined the
earnest wish to procure relics, which were then sought for with eagerness by
the devotion of the faithful. All who returned from the East made it their
glory to bring back to their country some precious remains of Christian
antiquity, and above all the bones of holy martyrs, which constituted the
ornament and the riches of their churches and upon which princes and
kings swore to respect truth and justice. The productions of Asia likewise
attracted the attention of the people of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[860-1050 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In short, the Christians of Palestine and the Moslem provinces, the
pilgrims and travellers who returned from the East, seemed no longer to
have any persecutions to dread, when all at once new storms broke out in
the East. The children of Harun soon shared the fate of the posterity
of Charlemagne, and Asia, like the West, was plunged into the horrors of
anarchy and civil war. The gigantic empire of the Abbasids crumbled
away on all sides, and the world, according to the expression of an Arabian
writer, was within the reach of him who would take possession of it. The
Greeks then appeared to rouse themselves from their long supineness,
and sought to take advantage of the divisions and the humiliation of the
Saracens. Nicephorus Phocas took the field at the head of a powerful
army, and recaptured Antioch from the Moslems. Deprived of the powerful
stimulus of fanaticism, Nicephorus found among the Greeks more
panegyrists than soldiers, and could not pursue his advantages against the
Saracens. His triumphs were confined to the taking of Antioch, and only
served to create a persecution against the Christians of Palestine.</p>

<p>Zimisces resolved to avenge the outrage inflicted upon religion and the
empire. On all sides preparations were set on foot for a fresh war against
the Saracens. The nations of the West were no strangers to this enterprise,
which preceded, by more than a year, the first of the Crusades. After
having defeated the Mussulmans on the banks of the Tigris, and forced the
caliph of Baghdad to pay a tribute, Zimisces penetrated, almost without
resistance, into Judea, took possession of Cæsarea, of Ptolemais, of Tiberias,
Nazareth, and several other cities of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>After this first campaign, the Holy Land appeared to be on the eve of
being delivered entirely from the yoke of the infidels, when the emperor died
poisoned. His death at once put a stop to the execution of an enterprise of
which he was the soul and the leader. The Christian nations had scarcely
time to rejoice at the delivery of Jerusalem, when they learned that the
Holy City had again fallen into the hands of the Fatimite caliphs, who, after
the death of Zimisces, had invaded Syria and Palestine. Hakim, the third
of the Fatimite caliphs, signalised his reign by all the excesses of fanaticism
and outrage. Unfixed in his own projects, and wavering between two
religions, he by turns protected and persecuted Christianity.</p>

<p>The inconstancy of Hakim, in a degree, mitigated the misfortunes of
Jerusalem, and he had just granted liberty to the Christians to rebuild their
churches, when he died by the hand of the assassin. His successor, guided
by a wiser policy, tolerated both pilgrimages and the exercise of the Christian
religion. The church of the Holy Sepulchre was not entirely rebuilt till
thirty years after its destruction; but the spectacle of its ruins still inflamed
the zeal and the devotion of the Christians. In the eleventh century the
Latin church allowed pilgrimages to suffice instead of canonical penitences;
sinners were condemned to quit their country for a time, and to lead a wandering
life, after the example of Cain. There existed no crime that might
not be expiated by the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Even the weak and timid
sex was not deterred by the perils of a long voyage.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_1b1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>CHARACTER OF THE PILGRIMS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1000-1050 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Though pilgrimages were generally considered acts of virtue, yet some
of the leaders of the church accounted them useless and criminal. Gregory,
bishop of Nyssa, in the fourth century, dissuades his flock from these journeys.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
They were not conscientious obligations, he said, for in the description of
persons whom Christ had promised to acknowledge in the next world the
name of pilgrim could not be found. A migratory life was dangerous to
virtue, particularly to the modesty of women.</p>

<p>The necessity of making a pilgrimage to Rome and other places was often
urged by ladies, who did not wish to be mewed in the solitary gloom of a
cloister, “chaunting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.” In the ninth
century, a foreign bishop wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury, requesting,
in very earnest terms, that English women of every rank and degree might
be prohibited from pilgrimising to Rome. Their gallantries were notorious
over all the continent. “<i>Perpaucæ enim sunt civitates in Longobardia, vel in
Francia, aut in Gallia, in qua non sit adultera
vel meretrix generis Anglorum: quod scandalum
est, et turpitudo totius ecclesiæ.</i>” Muratori,
<i>Antiquitates Italiæ Med. Ævi, Dissert. 58</i>, vol.
V., p. 58. “There are few cities in Lombardy,
in France, or in Gaul, in which there is not an
English adultress or harlot, to the scandal and
disgrace of the whole church.” Morality did
not improve as the world grew older. The
prioress in Chaucer, demure as she is, wears a
bracelet on which was inscribed the sentence,
“<i>Amor vincit omnia.</i>” The gallant monk, in
the same pilgrimage, ties his hood with a true-lover’s
knot.</p>

<p>Horror at spectacles of vice would diminish
with familiarity, and the moral principle would
gradually be destroyed. Malice, idolatry,
poisoning, and bloodshed disgraced Jerusalem
itself; and so dreadfully polluted was the city
that, if any man wished to have a more than
ordinary spiritual communication with Christ,
he had better quit his earthly tabernacle at
once than endeavour to enjoy it in places
originally sacred, but which had been since
defiled. Some years after the time of Gregory,
a similar description of the depravity at Jerusalem
was given by St. Jerome, and the Latin
father commends a monk who, though a resident
in Palestine, had but on one occasion travelled
to the city. The opinions of these two venerable
spiritual guides could not stem the torrent
of popular religion. The coffers of the church were enriched by the sale of
relics, and the dominion of the clergy became powerful in proportion to the
growth of religious abuses and corruptions. Pilgrims from India, Ethiopia,
Britannia, and Hibernia went to Jerusalem; and the tomb of Christ
resounded with hymns in various languages. Bishops and teachers would
have thought it a disgrace to their piety and learning if they had not adored
their Saviour on the very spot where his cross had first shed the light of his
Gospel.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p327.jpg" width="200" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Pilgrim and Shrine</span></p>
</div>

<p>The assertion, that “the coffers of the church were enriched by the sale
of relics,” requires some observations; because the sale of one relic in particular
encouraged the ardour of pilgrimages, and from the ardour the Crusades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
arose. During the fourth century, Christendom was duped into the belief
that the very cross on which Christ had suffered had been discovered in
Jerusalem. The city’s bishop was the keeper of the treasure, but the faithful
never offered their money in vain for a fragment of the holy wood. They
listened with credulity to the assurance of their priests that a living virtue
pervaded an inanimate and insensible substance, and that the cross permitted
itself every day to be divided into several parts, and yet remained uninjured
and entire. Thus Erasmus says, in his entertaining dialogue on pilgrimages,
that “if the fragments of the cross were collected, enough would be found
for the building of a ship.” It was publicly exhibited during the religious
festivities of Easter, and Jerusalem was crowded with pious strangers to
witness the solemn spectacle. But after four ages of perpetual distribution,
the world was filled with relics, and superstition craved for a novel object.
Accordingly, the Latin clergy of Palestine pretended that on the vigil of
Easter, after the great lamps in the church of the Resurrection had been
extinguished, they were relighted by God himself. People flocked from the
West to the East in order to behold this act of the Divinity, and to catch
some portion of a flame which had the marvellous property of healing all
diseases, mental as well as bodily, if those who received it had faith.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_1c"><a href="#crusades_endnote_1c">c</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1050-1076 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The inclination to acquire holiness by the journey to Jerusalem became
at length so general that the troops of pilgrims alarmed by their numbers
the countries through which they passed, and although they came not as
soldiers they were designated “the armies of the Lord.” In the year 1054,
Litbert, bishop of Cambray, set out for the Holy Land, followed by more
than three thousand pilgrims from the provinces of Picardy and Flanders.</p>

<p>Ten years after, seven thousand Christians set out together from the
banks of the Rhine. This numerous caravan, which was the forerunner of
the Crusades, crossed Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Thrace, and was
welcomed at Constantinople by the emperor Constantine Ducas. After
having visited the churches of Byzantium, the pilgrims of the West traversed
Asia Minor and Syria without danger; but when they approached
Jerusalem, the sight of their riches aroused the cupidity of the Bedouin
Arabs, undisciplined hordes, who had neither country nor settled abode, and
who had rendered themselves formidable in the civil wars of the East. The
Arabs attacked the pilgrims of the West, and compelled them to sustain
a siege in an abandoned village; and this was on a Good Friday. The
emir of Ramala, informed by some fugitives, came happily to their rescue,
delivered them from the death with which they were threatened, and permitted
them to continue their journey. After having lost more than three
thousand of their companions, they returned to Europe, to relate their
tragical adventures, and the dangers of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>

<h5>THE TURKS IN POWER</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1076-1088 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>New perils and the most violent persecutions at this period threatened
both the pilgrims of the West and the Christians of Palestine. Asia was
once again about to change masters, and tremble beneath a fresh tyranny.
During several centuries the rich countries of the East had been subject
to continual invasions from the wild hordes of Tatary. The Turks,
issuing from countries situated beyond the Oxus, had rendered themselves
masters of Persia. Palestine yielded to the power of the Turks. The
conquerors spared neither the Christians nor the children of Ali, whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
the caliph of Baghdad represented to be the enemies of God. The Egyptian
garrison was massacred, and the mosques and the churches were delivered
up to pillage. The Holy City was flooded with the blood of Christians and
Mussulmans.</p>

<p>Other tribes of Turks, led by Suleiman, penetrated into Asia Minor.
They took possession of all the provinces through which pilgrims were
accustomed to pass on their way to Jerusalem. The standard of the prophet
floated over the walls of Edessa, Iconium, Tarsus, and Antioch. Thousands
of children had been circumcised. Everywhere the laws of the <i>Koran</i> took
the place of those of the Evangelists and of Greece. The black or white
tents of the Turks covered the plains and the mountains of Bithynia and
Cappadocia, and their flocks pastured among the ruins of the monasteries
and churches. The Greeks had never had to contend against more cruel and
terrible enemies than the Turks. In the midst of revolutions and civil wars,
the Greek Empire was hastening to its fall.</p>

<p>Whilst the empire of the East approached its fall and appeared sapped
by time and corruption, the institutions of the West were in their infancy.
The empire and the laws of Charlemagne no longer existed. Nations had
no relations with each other; and mistaking their political interests, made
wars without considering their consequences or their dangers, and concluded
peace without being at all aware whether it was advantageous or not. Royal
authority was nowhere sufficiently strong to arrest the progress of anarchy
and the abuses of feudalism. At the same time that Europe was full of
soldiers and covered with strong castles, the states themselves were without
support against their enemies, and had not an army to defend them.</p>

<p>Ten years before the invasion of Asia Minor by the Turks, Michael
Ducas, the successor of Romanus Diogenes, had implored the assistance of
the pope and the princes of the West. He had promised to remove all the
barriers which separated the Greek from the Roman church, if the Latins
would take up arms against the infidels. Gregory VII then filled the chair
of St. Peter. The hope of extending the religion and the empire of the
holy see into the East made him receive kindly the humble supplications of
Michael Ducas. Excited by his discourses, fifty thousand pilgrims agreed
to follow Gregory to Constantinople, and thence to Syria; but the affairs of
Europe suspended the execution of his projects.</p>

<p>Every day the power of the popes was augmented by the progress of
Christianity, and by the ever-increasing influence of the Latin clergy.
Rome was become a second time the capital of the world, and appeared
to have resumed, under the monk Hildebrand, the empire it had enjoyed
under the cæsars. Armed with the two-edged sword of Peter, Gregory
loudly proclaimed that all the kingdoms of the earth were under the dominion
of the holy see, and that his authority ought to be as universal as the
church of which he was the head. These dangerous pretensions, fostered by
the opinions of his age, engaged him immediately in violent disputes with
the emperor of Germany. He desired also to dictate laws to France, Spain,
Sweden, Poland, and England; and thinking of nothing but making himself
acknowledged as the great arbiter of states, he launched his anathemas even
against the throne of Constantinople, which he had undertaken to defend, and
gave no more attention to the deliverance of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After the death of Gregory, Victor III, although he pursued the policy of
his predecessor and had to contend against the emperor of Germany and
the party of the anti-pope Guibert (Clement III), did not neglect the opportunity
of making war against the Mussulmans. The Saracens, inhabiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
Africa, disturbed the navigation of the Mediterranean, and threatened the
coast of Italy. Victor invited the Christians to take arms, and promised
them the remission of all their sins if they went to fight against the infidels.
The inhabitants of Pisa, Genoa, and several other cities, urged by
their zeal for religion and their desire to defend their commerce, equipped
fleets, levied troops, and made a descent upon the coasts of Africa,
where, if we are to believe the chronicles of the time, they cut in pieces an
army of one hundred thousand Saracens.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_1b2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>PETER THE HERMIT</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1088-1095 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The true story of the first Crusade is, as Kugler<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_1d"><!-- letter not in references list for this chapter -->d</span> says, sufficiently marvellous.
It was a vast awakening in which religion, adventure, and design
forced the European peoples out of their narrow lines of life and brought
the West and East again in contact, and it grows in strangeness as we trace
the story in detail. But monkish, uncritical writings which record the
vague traditions of that great uprising have not rested satisfied with the marvellous
truth: they have added much that is legendary. Among the legends
that have failed to stand the test of recent scholarship, is the famous one which
made Peter the Hermit the originator of the first Crusade. We may now
feel sure that it was not Peter but Urban II who set going the great impetus;
but the legend of Peter the Hermit has grown into the story of the first Crusade,
and won its place in history from the belief of centuries. The reader
must, however, be aware, as he reads it, that we have no authentic account
of Peter’s preaching before the Council of Clermont. He was probably one
of the preachers who scattered the enthusiasm of that council in northeastern
France. His preaching was likely limited to the land where he could be
understood in the vernacular, and his real influence is rather to be estimated
by the rabble that followed him and Walter the Penniless, to leave their
bones by the Danube or Bosporus. So much prefaced, let us turn to the
story.</p>

<p>As the legend runs, Peter, an obscure hermit, came from his retreat, and
followed into Palestine the crowd of Christians who went to visit the holy
places.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span> The sight of Jerusalem excited him much more than any of the other
pilgrims, for it created in his ardent mind a thousand conflicting sentiments.
In the city, which exhibited everywhere marks of the mercy and the anger
of God, all objects inflamed his piety, irritated his devotion and his zeal, and
filled him by turns with respect, terror, and indignation. After having
followed his brethren to Calvary and the tomb of Christ he repaired to
the patriarch of Jerusalem. The white hairs of Simeon, his venerable
figure, and above all the persecution which he had undergone, bespoke
the full confidence of Peter, and they wept together over the ills of the
Christians. The patriarch resolved to implore, by his letters, the help of
the pope and the princes of Europe, and the hermit swore to be the interpreter
of the Christians of the East and to rouse the West to take arms
for their deliverance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p331.jpg" width="150" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Hermit of the Middle Ages</span></p>
</div>

<p>After this interview, the enthusiasm of Peter knew no bounds; he was
persuaded that heaven itself called upon him to avenge its cause. One day,
whilst prostrated before the Holy Sepulchre, he believed that he heard the
voice of Christ, which said to him: “Peter, arise! hasten to proclaim
the tribulations of my people; it is time that my servants should receive
help, and that the holy places should be delivered.” Full of the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
these words, which sounded unceasingly in his ears, and charged with
letters from the patriarch, he quitted Palestine, crossed the seas, landed
on the coast of Italy, and hastened to cast himself at the feet of the pope.
The chair of St. Peter was then occupied by Urban II, who had been the
disciple and confidant of both Gregory and Victor. Urban embraced
with ardour a project which had been entertained by his predecessors; he
received Peter as a prophet, applauded his design, and bade him go forth
and announce the approaching deliverance of Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1095-1096 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Peter the Hermit traversed Italy, crossed the Alps, visited all parts of
France, and the greatest portion of Europe, inflaming all hearts with the
same zeal that consumed his own. He travelled
mounted on a mule, with a crucifix in his hand, his
feet bare, his head uncovered, his body girded with
a thick cord, covered with a long frock, and a
hermit’s hood of the coarsest stuff. The singularity
of his appearance was a spectacle for the people,
whilst the austerity of his manners, his charity, and
the moral doctrines that he preached caused him to
be revered as a saint wherever he went.</p>

<p>He went from city to city, from province to
province, working upon the courage of some and upon
the piety of others; sometimes haranguing from the
pulpits of the churches, sometimes preaching in the
high-roads or public places. His eloquence was
animated and impressive, and filled with those
vehement apostrophes which produce such effects
upon an uncultivated multitude. He described the
profanation of the holy places, and the blood of the
Christians shed in torrents in the streets of Jerusalem.
He invoked, by turns, heaven, the saints, the angels,
whom he called upon to bear witness to the truth of
what he told them. He apostrophised Mount Zion,
the rock of Calvary, and the Mount of Olives, which
he made to resound with sobs and groans. When
he had exhausted speech in painting the miseries of
the faithful, he showed the spectators the crucifix
which he carried with him; sometimes striking his
breast and wounding his flesh, sometimes shedding
torrents of tears. The people followed the steps of
Peter in crowds. The preacher of the holy war
was received everywhere as a messenger from God.</p>

<h5>THE APPEAL OF THE EMPEROR ALEXIUS</h5>

<p>In the midst of this general excitement, Alexius
Comnenus, who was threatened by the Turks, sent
ambassadors to the pope, to solicit the assistance of the Latins. “Without
the prompt assistance of all the Christian states,” he wrote, “Constantinople
must fall under the most frightful domination of the Turks.” He reminded
the princes of Christianity of the holy relics preserved in Constantinople,
and conjured them to save so sacred an assemblage of venerated objects from
the profanation of the infidels. After having set forth the splendour and the
riches of his capital, he exhorted the knights and barons to come and defend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
them; he offered them his treasures as the reward of their valour, and
painted in glowing colours the beauty of the Greek women, whose love
would repay the exploits of his liberators. Thus, nothing was spared that
could flatter the passions or arouse the enthusiasm of the warriors of the
West.</p>

<h5>COUNCILS OF PLACENTIA AND CLERMONT</h5>

<p>In compliance with the prayers of Alexius and the wishes of the faithful,
the sovereign pontiff convoked a council at Placentia, in order there to
expose the dangers of the Greek and Latin churches in the East. The
preachings of Peter had so prepared the minds and animated the zeal of
the faithful, that more than two hundred bishops and archbishops, four thousand
ecclesiastics, and thirty thousand of the laity obeyed the invitation of
the holy see. The council was so numerous that it was obliged to be held
in a plain in the neighbourhood of the city. The Council of Placentia,
however, came to no determination upon the war against the infidels. The
deliverance of the Holy Land was far from being the only object of this
council: the declarations of the empress Adelaide, who came to reveal her
own shame and that of her husband, anathemas against the emperor of
Germany and the anti-pope Guibert, occupied, during several days, the
attention of Urban and the assembled fathers.</p>

<p>A new council assembled at Clermont, in Auvergne. Before it gave up
its attention to the holy war, the council at first considered the reform of the
clergy and ecclesiastical discipline; and it then occupied itself in placing a
restraint upon the license of wars among individuals. In these barbarous
times even simple knights never thought of redressing their injuries by any
other means than arms. It was not an uncommon thing to see families, for
the slightest causes, commence a war against each other that would last
during several generations; Europe was distracted with troubles occasioned
by these hostilities. In the impotence of the laws and the governments, the
church often exerted its salutary influence to restore tranquillity; several
councils had placed their interdict upon private wars during four days of the
week, and their decrees had invoked the vengeance of heaven against disturbers
of the public peace. The Council of Clermont renewed the Truce
of God, and threatened all who refused “to accept peace and justice” with
the thunders of the church. One of its decrees placed widows, orphans,
merchants, and labourers under the safeguard of religion. They declared,
as they had already done in other councils, that the churches should be so
many inviolable sanctuaries, and that crosses, even, placed upon the high-roads,
should become points of refuge against violence.</p>

<p>Humanity and reason must applaud such salutary decrees; but the sovereign
pontiff, although he presented himself as the defender of the sanctity
of marriage, did not merit the same praises when he pronounced in this
council an anathema against Philip I. But such was then the general infatuation,
that no one was astonished that a king of France should be
excommunicated in the very bosom of his own kingdom. The sentence of
Urban could not divert attention from an object that seemed much more
imposing, and the excommunication of Philip scarcely holds a place in the history
of the Council of Clermont. The faithful, gathered from all the
provinces, had but one single thought; they spoke of nothing but the evils
the Christians endured in Palestine, and saw nothing but the war which was
about to be declared against the infidels. Enthusiasm and fanaticism, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
always increase in large assemblies, were carried to their full height. Urban
at length satisfied the impatience of the faithful&mdash;impatience which he,
perhaps, had adroitly excited, and which was the surest guarantee of success.</p>

<p>The council held its tenth sitting in the great square or place of Clermont,
which was soon filled by an immense crowd. Followed by his cardinals, the
pope ascended a species of throne which had been prepared for him; at his
side was Peter the Hermit, clad in that whimsical and uncouth garb which
had everywhere drawn upon him the attention and the respect of the multitude.
Urban, who spoke after Peter, represented, as he had done, the holy
places as profaned by the domination of the infidels.</p>

<p>As Urban proceeded, the sentiments by which he was animated penetrated
to the very souls of his auditors. When he spoke of the captivity and the
misfortunes of Jerusalem, the whole assembly was dissolved in tears; when
he described the tyranny and the perfidy of the infidels, the warriors who
listened to him clutched their swords, and swore in their hearts to avenge
the cause of the Christians. Urban redoubled their enthusiasm by announcing
that God had chosen them to accomplish his designs, and exhorted
them to turn those arms against the Moslems which they now bore in conflict
against their brothers. They were not now called upon to revenge the
injuries of men, but injuries offered to divinity; it was now not the conquest
of a town or a castle that was offered to them as the reward of their valour,
but the riches of Asia, the possession of a land in which, according to the
promises of the Scriptures, flowed streams of milk and honey.</p>

<p>“Christian warriors,” he exclaimed, “who seek without end for vain pretexts
for war, rejoice, for you have to-day found true ones. You who have
been so often the terror of your fellow-citizens, go and fight against the barbarians,
go and fight for the deliverance of the holy places; you who sell for
vile pay the strength of your arms to the fury of others, armed with the
sword of the Maccabees, go and merit an eternal reward. If you triumph
over your enemies, the kingdoms of the East will be your heritage; if you
are conquered, you will have the glory of dying in the very same place as
Jesus Christ, and God will not forget that he shall have found you in his
holy ranks. This is the moment to prove that you are animated by a true
courage; this is the moment in which you may expiate so many violences
committed in the bosom of peace, so many victories purchased at the expense
of justice and humanity. If you must have blood, bathe your hands in the
blood of the infidels. I speak to you with harshness, because my ministry
obliges me to do so: soldiers of hell, become soldiers of the living God!
When Jesus Christ summons you to his defence, let no base affections detain
you in your homes; see nothing but the shame and the evils of the Christians;
listen to nothing but the groans of Jerusalem, and remember well what the
Lord has said to you: ‘He who loves his father and his mother more than
me, is not worthy of me; whoever shall abandon his house, or his father, or
his mother, or his wife, or his children, or his inheritance, for the sake of my
name, shall be recompensed a hundredfold, and possess life eternal.’”</p>

<p>At these words the auditors of Urban displayed an enthusiasm that
human eloquence had never before inspired. The assembly arose in one
mass as one man, and answered him with a unanimous cry, “It is the will
of God! It is the will of God!”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Pity, indignation, despair, at the same
time agitated the tumultuous assembly of the faithful; some shed tears over
Jerusalem and the fate of the Christians; others swore to exterminate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
race of the Moslems; but, all at once, at a signal from the sovereign pontiff,
the most profound silence prevailed. Cardinal Gregory, who afterwards
occupied the chair of St. Peter under the name of
Innocent II, pronounced, in a loud voice, a form of
general confession, the assembly all fell upon their
knees, beat their breasts, and received absolution
for their sins. All the faithful decorated their
garments with a red cross. From that time, all
who engaged to combat the infidels were termed
“bearers of the cross,”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and the holy war took the
name of “Crusade.” The faithful solicited Urban
to place himself at their head; but the pontiff,
who had not yet triumphed over the anti-pope
Guibert, who was dealing out at the same time
his anathemas against the king of France and
the emperor of Germany, could not quit Europe
without compromising the power and the policy of
the holy see. He refused to be chief of the crusade,
and named the bishop of Puy apostolic legate
with the army of the Christians.</p>

<h5>THE FRENZY OF EUROPE</h5>

<p>He promised to all who assumed the cross the
entire remission of their sins. Their persons, their
families, their property, were all placed under the
protection of the church and of the apostles St.
Peter and St. Paul. The council declared that
every violence exercised upon the soldiers of
Christ should be punished by anathema, and
recommended its decrees in favour of the bearers
of the cross to the watchful care of all bishops
and priests. It regulated the discipline and the
departure of those who had enrolled themselves in
the holy ranks, and for fear reflection might
deter any from leaving their homes, it threatened
with excommunication all those who did not fulfil
their vows.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Monks of the Middle Ages</span></p>
</div>

<p>It might be said that the French had no longer
any other country than the Holy Land, and that
to it they were bound to sacrifice their ease, their
property, and their lives. This enthusiasm, which
had no bounds, was not long in extending itself
to the other Christian nations; the flame which
consumed France was communicated to England, still disturbed by the
recent conquest of the Normans; to Germany, troubled by the anathema<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
of Gregory and Urban; to Italy, agitated by its factions; to Spain, even,
although it had to combat the Saracens on its own territory.</p>

<p>The devotion for pilgrimages, which had been increasing during several
centuries, became a passion and an imperative want for most Christians;
everyone was eager to march to Jerusalem, and to take part in the crusade,
which was, in all respects, an armed pilgrimage. The situation in which
Europe was then placed no doubt contributed to increase the number of
pilgrims. “All things were in such disorder,” says William of Tyre, “that
the world appeared to be approaching to its end, and was ready to fall again
into the confusion of chaos.” Everywhere the people groaned under a horrible
servitude; a frightful scarcity of provisions, which had during several
years desolated France and the greater part of the kingdoms of the West,
had given birth to all sorts of brigandage and violence; and these proving
the destruction of agriculture and commerce increased still further the horrors
of the famine. Villages, towns even, became void of inhabitants, and
sank into ruins. The people abandoned a land which no longer nourished
them, or could offer them either repose or security: the standard of the
cross appeared to them a certain asylum against misery and oppression.
According to the decrees of the Council of Clermont, the crusaders were
freed from all imposts, and could not be pursued for debts during their
voyage. At the name of the cross the very laws suspended their menaces,
tyranny could not seek its victims, nor justice even the guilty, amidst those
whom the church adopted for its defenders. The assurance of impunity,
the hope of a better fate, the love of license, and a desire to shake off the
most sacred ties, actuated a vast proportion of the multitude which flocked
to the banners of the crusade.</p>

<p>Many nobles who had not at first taken the cross, and who saw their
vassals set out, without having the power to prevent them, determined to
follow them as military chiefs, in order to preserve some portion of their
authority. It was known that two or three hundred Norman pilgrims had
conquered Apulia and Sicily from the Saracens. The lands occupied by the
infidels appeared to be heritages promised to knights whose whole wealth
consisted in their birth, their valour, and their sword.</p>

<p>We should nevertheless deceive ourselves if we did not believe that religion
was the principle which acted most powerfully upon the greater number
of the crusaders. In ordinary times men follow their natural inclinations,
and only obey the voice of their own interest; but in the times of the
Crusades, religious fever was a blind passion which spoke louder than all
others. Religion permitted not any other glory, any other felicity to be
seen by its ardent defenders, but those which she presented to their heated
imagination. Love of country, family ties, the most tender affections of the
heart, were all sacrificed to the ideas and the opinions which then possessed
the whole of Europe. Moderation was cowardice, indifference treason,
opposition a sacrilegious interference. The power of the laws was reckoned
as nothing amongst men who believed they were fighting in the cause of God.
Subjects scarcely acknowledged the authority of princes or lords in anything
which concerned the holy war; the master and the slave had no other
title than that of Christian, no other duty to perform than that of defending
his religion, sword in hand.</p>

<p>They whom age or condition appeared to detain in Europe, and whom
the council had exempted from the labours and perils of the crusade, caused
the heaven which called them to the holy war to speak aloud. Women and
children imprinted crosses upon their delicate and weak limbs, to show the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
will of God. Monks deserted the cloisters in which they had sworn to die,
believing themselves led by a divine inspiration; hermits and anchorites
issued from forests and deserts, and mingled with the crowd of crusaders.
What is still more difficult to believe, thieves and robbers, quitting their
secret retreats, came to confess their crimes, and promised, whilst receiving
the cross, to go and expiate them in Palestine.</p>

<p>Europe appeared to be a land of exile, which everyone was eager to quit.
Artisans, traders, labourers, abandoned the occupations by which they subsisted;
barons and lords even renounced the domains of their fathers. The
lands, the cities, the castles, for which they had but of late been at war, all at
once lost their value in the eyes of their possessors, and were given up, for
small sums, to those whom the grace of God had not touched, and who were
not called to the happiness of visiting the holy places and conquering the
East.</p>

<p>Contemporary authors relate several miracles which assisted in heating
the minds of the multitude. Stars fell from the firmament; traces of blood
were seen in the heavens; cities, armies, and knights decorated with the
cross were pictured in the clouds. We will not relate all the other miracles
reported by historians, which were believed in an age in which nothing was
more common than prodigies, in which, according to the remark of Fleury,
the taste for the wonderful prevailed greatly over that for the true. Our
readers will find quite enough of extraordinary things in the description of
so many great events for which the moral world, and even nature herself,
seemed to have interrupted their laws. What prodigy, in fact, can more
astonish the philosopher, than to see Europe, which may be said to have
been agitated to its very foundations, move all at once, and like a single
man march in arms towards the East?</p>

<p>The Council of Clermont, which was held in the month of November,
1095, had fixed the departure of the crusaders for the festival of the Assumption
of the following year. During the winter nothing was thought of but
preparations for the voyage to the Holy Land. As soon as the spring appeared,
nothing could restrain the impatience of the crusaders, and they
set forward on their march to the places at which they were to assemble.
The greater number went on foot; some horsemen appeared amongst the
multitude; a great many travelled in cars; they were clothed in a variety
of manners, and armed, in the same way, with lances, swords, javelins, iron
clubs, etc. The crowd of crusaders presented a whimsical and confused
mixture of all ranks and all conditions; women appeared in arms in the
midst of warriors, prostitution not being forgotten among the austerities of
penitence. Old age was to be seen with infancy, opulence next to misery;
the helmet was confounded with the frock, the mitre with the sword.
Around cities, around fortresses, in the plains, upon the mountains, were
raised tents and pavilions; everywhere was displayed a preparation for war
and festivity. Here was heard the sound of arms or the braying of trumpets;
whilst at a short distance the air was filled with psalms and spiritual
songs. From the Tiber to the ocean, and from the Rhine to the other side
of the Pyrenees, nothing was to be seen but troops of men marked with the
cross, who swore to exterminate the Saracens, and were chanting their songs
of conquest beforehand. On all sides resounded the war-cry of the crusaders:
“It is the will of God! It is the will of God!”</p>

<p>Families, whole villages, set out for Palestine, and drew into their ranks
all they met with on their passage. They marched on without forethought,
and would not believe that he who nourishes the sparrow would leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
pilgrims clothed with the holy cross to perish with want. Their ignorance
added to their illusion, and lent an air of enchantment to everything they
saw; they believed at every moment they were approaching the end of their
pilgrimage. The children of the villagers, when they saw a city or a castle,
asked if that was Jerusalem. Many of the great lords, who had passed their
lives in their rustic donjons, knew very little more on this head than their
vassals; they took with them their hunting and fishing appointments, and
marched with their falcons on their wrists, preceded by their hounds. They
expected to reach Jerusalem enjoying themselves on the road, and to exhibit
to Asia the rude luxury of their castles.</p>

<p>In the midst of the general delirium, no sage caused the voice of reason
to be heard; nobody was then astonished at that which now creates so much
surprise. These scenes so strange, in which everyone was an actor, could
only be a spectacle for posterity.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_1b3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

was sewed upon the right shoulder of the coat or mantle, or else fastened on the front of the
helmet, after having been blessed by the pope or some bishop. The prayers and ceremonies
used on this occasion are still to be found in the Romish ritual. On returning from the Holy
Land, they removed this mark from the shoulder and placed it on the back, or else wore it at the

<p>The 15th of August had been fixed in the Council of Clermont for the
departure of the pilgrims; but the day was anticipated by the thoughtless
and needy crowd of plebeians. Early in the spring, from the confines of
France and Lorraine, above sixty thousand of the populace of both sexes,
flocked round the first missionary of the Crusades, and pressed him with
clamorous importunity to lead them to the Holy Sepulchre. The hermit,
assuming the character, without the talents or authority, of a general, impelled
or obeyed the forward impulse of his votaries along the banks of the Rhine
and Danube. Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate, and
his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, a valiant though needy soldier, conducted
a vanguard of pilgrims, whose condition may be determined from the
proportion of eight horsemen to fifteen thousand foot.</p>

<p>The example and footsteps of Peter were closely pursued by another
fanatic, the monk Godescal [or Gottschalk], whose sermons had swept away
fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the villages of Germany. Their
rear was again pressed by a herd of two hundred thousand, the most stupid
and savage refuse of the people, who mingled with their devotion a brutal
license of rapine, prostitution, and drunkenness. Some counts and gentlemen,
at the head of three thousand horse, attended the motions of the multitude
to partake in the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may we credit such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
folly?) were a goose and a goat, who were carried in the front, and to whom
these worthy Christians ascribed an infusion of the divine Spirit. Of these,
and of other bands of enthusiasts, the first and most easy warfare was against
the Jews, the murderers of the Son of God. In the trading cities of the
Moselle and the Rhine, their colonies were numerous and rich; and they
enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor and the bishops, the free exercise
of their religion. At Verdun, Trèves, Mainz, Speier, Worms, many
thousands of that unhappy people were pillaged and massacred; nor had
they felt a more bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian. A remnant
was saved by the firmness of their bishops, who accepted a feigned
and transient conversion; but the more obstinate Jews opposed their fanaticism
to the fanaticism of the Christians, barricaded their houses, and precipitating
themselves, their families, and their wealth into the rivers or the
flames, disappointed the malice, or at least the avarice, of their implacable
foes.</p>

<h5>PETER THE HERMIT AND HIS RABBLE</h5>

<p>Between the frontiers of Austria and the seat of the Byzantine monarchy
the crusaders were compelled to traverse an interval of six hundred miles&mdash;the
wild and desolate countries of Hungary and Bulgaria. Both nations
had imbibed the rudiments of Christianity: the Hungarians were ruled by
their native princes, the Bulgarians by a lieutenant of the Greek emperor;
but on the slightest provocation their ferocious nature was rekindled, and
ample provocation was afforded by the disorders of the first pilgrims. Agriculture
must have been unskilful and languid among a people whose cities
were built of reeds and timber, which were deserted in the summer season
for the tents of hunters and shepherds. A scanty supply of provisions was
rudely demanded, forcibly seized, and greedily consumed; and on the first
quarrel, the crusaders gave a loose rein to indignation and revenge. But
their ignorance of the country, of war, and of discipline exposed them to
every snare. The Greek prefect of Bulgaria commanded a regular force;
at the trumpet of the Hungarian king, the eighth or the tenth of his martial
subjects bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was
insidious, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was unrelenting and
bloody. About a third of the naked fugitives, and the hermit Peter was of
the number, escaped to the Thracian Mountains; and the emperor, who
respected the pilgrimage and succour of the Latins, conducted them by
secure and easy journeys to Constantinople, and advised them to await the
arrival of their brethren.</p>

<p>For awhile they remembered their faults and losses; but no sooner were
they revived by the hospitable entertainment than their venom was again
inflamed; they stung their benefactor, and neither gardens, nor palaces, nor
churches were safe from their depredations. For his own safety, Alexius
allured them to pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosporus; but their
blind impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had
assigned, and to rush headlong against the Turks who occupied the road of
Jerusalem. The hermit, conscious of his shame, had withdrawn from the
camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, who was
worthy of a better command, attempted without success to introduce some
order and prudence among the herd of savages. They separated in quest
of prey, and themselves fell an easy prey to the arts of the sultan. By a
rumour that their foremost companions were rioting in the spoils of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
capital, Suleiman tempted the main body to descend into the plain of
Nicæa; they were overwhelmed by the Turkish arrows; and a pyramid of
bones informed their companions of the place of their defeat. Of the first
crusaders, three hundred thousand<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> had already perished before a single city
was rescued from the infidels, before their graver and more noble brethren
had completed the preparations of their enterprise.</p>

<h5>THE LEADERS OF THE FIRST CRUSADE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1096-1097 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>None of the great sovereigns of Europe embarked their persons in the
First Crusade. The religious ardour was more strongly felt by the princes
of the second order, who held an important place in the feudal system.
The first rank both in war and council is justly due to Godfrey de Bouillon;
and happy would it have been for the crusaders, if they had trusted themselves
to the sole conduct of that accomplished hero, a worthy representative
of Charlemagne, from whom he was descended in the female line.</p>

<p>In the service of Henry IV, he bore the great standard of the empire,
and pierced with his lance the breast of Rudolf the rebel king; Godfrey
was the first who ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow,
perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the pope, confirmed an early
resolution of visiting the Holy Sepulchre, not as a pilgrim but a deliverer.
His valour was matured by prudence and moderation; his piety, though
blind, was sincere; and in the tumult of a camp he practised the real and
fictitious virtues of a convent. Superior to the private factions of the chiefs,
he reserved his enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a
kingdom by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged by
his rivals. Godfrey de Bouillon was accompanied by his two brothers&mdash;by
Eustace the elder, who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by
the younger, Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue.</p>

<p>In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the king’s presence, about
two months after the Council of Clermont, Hugh, count of Vermandois was
the most conspicuous of the princes who assumed the cross. But the appellation
of “the great” was applied, not so much to his merit or possessions
(though neither were contemptible) as to the royal birth of the brother
of the king of France. Robert, duke of Normandy, was the eldest son of
William the Conqueror; but on his father’s death he was deprived of the
kingdom of England by his own indolence and the activity of his brother
Rufus. For the trifling sum of ten thousand marks he mortgaged Normandy,
during his absence, to the English usurper; but his engagement and
behaviour in the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of manners,
and restored him in some degree to the public esteem. Another Robert was
count of Flanders; he was surnamed the Sword and Lance of the Christians;
but in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot the duties of a
general. Stephen, count of Chartres, of Blois, and of Troyes, was one of
the richest princes of the age; and the number of his castles has been compared
to the 365 days of the year. His mind was improved by literature; and
in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent Stephen was chosen to discharge
the office of their president. These four were the principal leaders of the
French, the Normans, and the pilgrims of the British Isles; but the list<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
of the barons who were possessed of three or four towns would exceed,
says a contemporary, the catalogue of the Trojan War.</p>

<p>In the south of France, the command was assumed by Adhemar, bishop
of Puy, the pope’s legate; and by Raymond, count of St. Giles and Toulouse,
who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne and marquis of Provence.
The former was a respectable prelate, alike qualified for this world and the
next. The latter was a veteran warrior, who had fought against the Saracens
of Spain, and who consecrated his declining age not only to the deliverance
but to the perpetual service of the Holy Sepulchre. A mercantile, rather
than a martial spirit prevailed among his provincials&mdash;a common name which
included the natives of Auvergne and Languedoc&mdash;the
vassals of the kingdom of Burgundy
or Arles. From the adjacent frontier
of Spain, he drew a band of hardy adventurers;
as he marched through Lombardy, a crowd of
Italians flocked to his standard, and his united
force consisted of one hundred thousand horse
and foot. If Raymond was the first to enlist
and the last to depart, the delay may be
excused by the greatness of his preparation
and the promise of an everlasting farewell.</p>

<p>The name of Bohemond, the son of Robert
Guiscard, was already famous by his double
victory over the Greek emperor; but his
father’s will had reduced him to the principality
of Taranto and the remembrance of
his eastern trophies, till he was awakened by
the rumour and passage of the French pilgrims.
It is in the person of this Norman
chief that we may seek for the coolest policy
and ambition with a small alloy of religious
fanaticism. His conduct may justify a belief
that he had secretly directed the design of the
pope, which he affected to second with astonishment
and zeal. At the siege of Amalfi, his
example and discourse inflamed the passions
of a confederate army; he instantly tore his
garment to supply crosses for the numerous
candidates and prepared to visit Constantinople
and Asia at the head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot.
Several princes of the Norman race accompanied this veteran general; and
his cousin Tancred was the partner, rather than the servant, of the war. In
the accomplished character of Tancred we discover all the virtues of a perfect
knight&mdash;the true spirit of chivalry, which inspired the generous sentiments
and social offices of man, far better than the base philosophy, or the baser
religion, of the times.</p>

<p>Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the Crusades, a revolution
had taken place among the Spaniards, the Normans, and the French, which
was gradually extended to the rest of Europe. The service of the infantry was
degraded to the plebeians; the cavalry formed the strength of the armies,
and the honourable name <i>miles</i>, or soldier, was confined to the gentlemen who
served on horseback and were invested with the character of knighthood.
The dukes and counts, who had usurped the rights of sovereignty, divided the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
provinces among their faithful barons; the barons distributed among their
vassals the fiefs or benefices of their jurisdiction; and these military tenants,
the peers of each other and of their lord, composed the noble or equestrian
order, which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same
species with themselves. The dignity of their birth was preserved by pure
and equal alliances; their sons alone who could produce four quarters or
lines of ancestry without spot or reproach, might legally pretend to the
honour of knighthood: but a valiant plebeian was sometimes enriched and
ennobled by the sword and became the father of a new race. A single knight
could impart, according to his judgment, the character which he received;
and the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this personal
distinction than from the lustre of their diadem.</p>

<p>Such were the troops, and such the leaders, who assumed the cross for
the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre. As soon as they were relieved by the
absence of the plebeian multitude, they encouraged each other, by interviews
and messages, to accomplish their vow and hasten their departure. Their
wives and sisters were desirous of partaking the danger and merit of the
pilgrimage; their portable treasures were conveyed in bars of silver and
gold; and the princes and barons were attended by their equipage of
hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to supply their table. The
difficulty of procuring subsistence for so many myriads of men and horses
engaged them to separate their forces; their choice or situation determined
the road; and it was agreed to meet in the neighbourhood of Constantinople,
and from thence to begin their operations against the Turks.</p>

<h5>ALEXIUS COMPELS HOMAGE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1097 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In some oriental tale there is the fable of a shepherd, who was ruined
by the accomplishment of his own wishes: he had prayed for water; the
Ganges was turned into his grounds, and his flock and cottage were swept
away by the inundation. Such was the fortune, or at least the apprehension,
of the Greek emperor Alexius Comnenus. In the Council of Placentia,
his ambassadors had solicited a moderate succour, perhaps of ten thousand
soldiers; but he was astonished by the approach of so many potent chiefs and
fanatic nations. The promiscuous multitudes of Peter the Hermit were savage
beasts, alike destitute of humanity and reason; nor was it possible for
Alexius to prevent or deplore their destruction. The troops of Godfrey
and his peers were less contemptible, but not less suspicious, to the Greek
emperor. Their motives might be pure and pious; but he was equally
alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond, and his ignorance of
the Transalpine chiefs; the courage of the French was blind and headstrong;
they might be tempted by the luxury and wealth of Greece, and
elated by the view and opinion of their invincible strength; and Jerusalem
might be forgotten in the prospect of Constantinople.</p>

<p>After a long march and painful abstinence, the troops of Godfrey encamped
in the plains of Thrace; they heard with indignation that their
brother, the count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the Greeks; and their
reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some freedom of retaliation
and rapine. They were appeased by the submission of Alexius;
he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused, in the midst of
winter, to pass the Bosporus, their quarters were assigned among the
gardens and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea. But an incurable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
jealousy still rankled in the minds of the two nations, who despised each
other as slaves and barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, and suspicion
was inflamed into daily provocations; prejudice is blind, hunger is
deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault the Latins in a
dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the waters. Godfrey sounded
his trumpets, burst the net, overspread the plain, and insulted the suburbs;
but the gates of Constantinople were strongly fortified; the ramparts were
lined with archers; and after a doubtful conflict, both parties listened to
the voice of peace and religion. The gifts and promises of the emperor
insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of the western strangers; as a Christian
warrior, he rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise,
which he engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return
of spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in
Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosporus than the Greek vessels
were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The same policy was repeated
with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the example and weakened
by the departure of their foremost companions. By his skill and diligence
Alexius prevented the union of any two of the confederate armies at the
same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before the feast of
the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast of Europe.</p>

<p>The same arms which threatened Europe might deliver Asia, and repel the
Turks from the neighbouring shores of the Bosporus and the Hellespont.
The fair provinces from Nicæa to Antioch were the recent patrimony of the
Roman emperor; and his ancient and perpetual claim still embraced
the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt. In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged, or
affected, the ambitious hope of leading his new allies to subvert the thrones
of the East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded him
from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and lawless barbarians.
His prudence, or his pride, was content with extorting from the
French princes an oath of homage and fidelity, and a solemn promise that
they would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests, as the humble
and loyal vassals of the Roman Empire. Their independent spirit was fired
at the mention of this foreign and voluntary servitude; they successively
yielded to the dexterous application of gifts and flattery; and the first
proselytes became the most eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply
the companions of their shame.</p>

<p>The ceremony of their homage was grateful to a people who had long
since considered pride as the substitute of power. High on his throne, the
emperor sat mute and immovable; his majesty was adored by the Latin
princes; and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his knees, an indignity
which their own writers are ashamed to confess, and unable to deny.</p>

<h5>NUMBERS OF THE CRUSADERS</h5>

<p>The conquest of Asia was undertaken and achieved by Alexander, with
thirty-five thousand Macedonians and Greeks; and his best hope was in the
strength and discipline of his phalanx of infantry. The principal force of
the crusaders consisted in their cavalry; and when that force was mustered
in the plains of Bithynia, the knights and their martial attendants on horseback
amounted to one hundred thousand fighting men, completely armed
with the helmet and coat of mail. The value of these soldiers deserved
a strict and authentic account; and the flower of European chivalry might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
furnish, in a first effort, this formidable body of heavy horse. A part of the
infantry might be enrolled for the service of scouts, pioneers, and archers;
but the promiscuous crowd were lost in their own disorder; and we depend
not on the eyes or knowledge, but on the belief and fancy of a chaplain of
Count Baldwin, in the estimate of six hundred thousand pilgrims able to bear
arms, besides the priests and monks, the women and children, of the
Latin camp. The reader starts; and before he recovers from his surprise,
we shall add, on the same testimony, that if all who took the cross had
accomplished their vow, above six millions would have migrated from Europe
to Asia. Under this oppression of faith we derive some relief from a more
sagacious and thinking writer, who, after the same review of the cavalry,
accuses the credulity of the priest of Chartres, and even doubts whether the
Cisalpine regions (in the geography of a Frenchman) were sufficient to produce
and pour forth such incredible multitudes. The coolest scepticism will
remember, that of these religious volunteers great numbers never beheld
Constantinople and Nicæa. Of enthusiasm the influence is irregular and
transient; many were detained at home by reason or cowardice, by poverty
or weakness; and many were repulsed by the obstacles of the way, the more
insuperable as they were unforeseen to these ignorant fanatics. The savage
countries of Hungary and Bulgaria were whitened with their bones; their
vanguard was cut in pieces by the Turkish sultan; and the loss of the first
adventure, by the sword, or climate, or fatigue, has already been stated at
three hundred thousand men. Yet the myriads that survived, that marched,
that pressed forwards on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment
to themselves and to the Greeks. The copious energy of her language
sinks under the efforts of the princess Anna Comnena; the images of locusts,
of leaves and flowers, of the sands of the sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly
represent what she had seen and heard; and the daughter of Alexius
exclaims, that Europe was loosened from its foundations and hurled against
Asia. The ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labour under the same doubt
of a vague and indefinite magnitude; but we are inclined to believe that a
larger number has never been contained within the lines of a single camp
than at the siege of Nicæa, the first operation of the Latin princes. Their
motives, their characters, and their arms, have been already displayed. Of
their troops the most numerous portion were natives of France; the Low
Countries, the banks of the Rhine, and Apulia sent a powerful reinforcement;
some bands of adventurers were drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and
England, and from the distant bogs and mountains of Ireland or Scotland
issued some naked and savage fanatics, ferocious at home, but unwarlike
abroad.</p>

<h5>THE SIEGE OF NICÆA</h5>

<p>We have expatiated with pleasure on the first steps of the crusaders, as
they paint the manners and character of Europe; but we shall abridge the
tedious and uniform narrative of their blind achievements, which were performed
by strength, and are described by ignorance. From their first station
in the neighbourhood of Nicomedia, they advanced in successive divisions;
passed the contracted limit of the Greek Empire; opened a road through
the hills, and commenced, by the siege of his capital, their pious warfare
against the Turkish sultan. His kingdom of Roum extended from the
Hellespont to the confines of Syria, and barred the pilgrimage of Jerusalem;
his name was Kilij-Arslan, or Suleiman, of the race of Seljuk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
and son of the first conqueror; and in the defence of a land which the
Turks considered as their own, he deserved the praise of his enemies, by
whom alone he is known to posterity. Yielding to the first impulse of the
torrent, he deposited his family and treasure in Nicæa; retired to the mountains
with fifty thousand horse; and twice descended to assault the camps
or quarters of the Christian besiegers, which formed an imperfect circle of
above six miles.</p>

<p>The lofty and solid walls of Nicæa were covered by a deep ditch, and
flanked by 370 towers; and on the verge of Christendom, the Moslems
were trained in arms, and inflamed by religion. Before this city, the French
princes occupied their stations, and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence
or subordination; emulation prompted their valour; but their
valour was sullied by cruelty, and their emulation degenerated into envy
and civil discord. In the space of seven weeks, much labour and blood
were expended, and some progress, especially by Count Raymond, was made
on the side of the besiegers. But the Turks could protract their resistance
and secure their escape, as long as they were masters of the lake Ascanius,
which stretches several miles to the westward of the city. The means of
conquest were supplied by the prudence and industry of Alexius; a great
number of boats was transported on sledges from the sea to the lake; they
were filled with the most dexterous of his archers; the flight of the sultana
was intercepted; Nicæa was invested by land and water; and a Greek emissary
persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master’s protection, and to save
themselves, by a timely surrender, from the rage of the savages of Europe.
In the moment of victory, or at least of hope, the crusaders, thirsting for
blood and plunder, were awed by the imperial banner that streamed from
the citadel; and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this important conquest.
The murmurs of the chiefs were stifled by honour or interest; and
after a halt of nine days, they directed their march towards Phrygia, under
the guidance of a Greek general, whom they suspected of a secret connivance
with the sultan. The consort and the principal servants of Suleiman
had been honourably restored without ransom; and the emperor’s generosity
to the miscreants was interpreted as treason to the Christian cause.</p>

<h5>BATTLE OF DORYLÆUM</h5>

<p>Suleiman was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his capital;
he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange invasion of the western
barbarians; the Turkish emirs obeyed the call of loyalty or religion;
the Turkoman hordes encamped round his standard; and his whole force
is loosely stated by the Christians at 200,000, or even 360,000 horse.
Yet he patiently waited till they had left behind them the sea and the
Greek frontier; and hovering on the flanks, observed their careless and
confident progress in two columns beyond the view of each other. Some
miles before they could reach Dorylæum in Phrygia, the left, and least
numerous, division was surprised and attacked and almost oppressed, by
the Turkish cavalry. The heat of the weather, the clouds of arrows, and the
barbarous onset, overwhelmed the crusaders; they lost their order and
confidence; and the fainting fight was sustained by the personal valour,
rather than by the military conduct, of Bohemond, Tancred, and Robert of
Normandy. They were revived by the welcome banners of Duke Godfrey,
who flew to their succour with the count of Vermandois and sixty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
horse; and was followed by Raymond of Toulouse, the bishop of Puy, and
the remainder of the sacred army. Without a moment’s pause, they formed
in new order, and advanced to a second battle. They were received with
equal resolution; and, in their common disdain for the unwarlike people of
Greece and Asia, it was confessed on both sides, that the Turks and the
Franks were the only nations entitled to the appellation of soldiers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p346.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Helmet of a Crusader of the First Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>As long as the horses were fresh and the quivers full, Suleiman maintained
the advantage of the day; and four thousand Christians were pierced
by the Turkish arrows. In the evening, swiftness yielded to strength; on
either side, the numbers were equal,
or at least as great as any ground
could hold, or any generals could
manage; but in turning the hills,
the last division of Raymond and
his provincials was led, perhaps
without design, on the rear of an
exhausted enemy, and the long contest
was determined. Besides a
nameless and unaccounted multitude,
three thousand pagan knights
were slain in the battle and pursuit;
the camp of Suleiman was
pillaged. Reserving ten thousand
guards of the relics of his army,
Suleiman evacuated the kingdom
of Roum, and hastened to implore
the aid, and kindle the resentment,
of his eastern brethren. In a
march of five hundred miles, the
crusaders traversed the Lesser Asia,
through a wasted land and deserted towns, without either finding a friend or
an enemy. The geographer may trace the position of Dorylæum, Antioch
of Pisidia, Iconium, Archelais, and Germanicia, and may compare those classic
appellations with the modern names of Eskishehr the old city, Akshehr the
white city, Cogni, Erekli, and Marash.</p>

<h5>PRINCIPALITY OF EDESSA FOUNDED</h5>

<p>To improve the general consternation, the cousin of Bohemond and the
brother of Godfrey were detached from the main army with their respective
squadrons of five, and of seven, hundred knights. They overran in a rapid
career the hills and sea coast of Cilicia, from Cogni to the Syrian gates; the
Norman standard was first planted on the walls of Tarsus and Malmistra;
but the proud injustice of Baldwin at length provoked the patient and generous
Italian; and they turned their consecrated swords against each other in a
private and profane quarrel. Honour was the motive, and fame the reward,
of Tancred; but fortune smiled on the more selfish enterprise of his rival.
He was called to the assistance of a Greek or Armenian tyrant, who had been
suffered under the Turkish yoke to reign over the Christians of Edessa.
Baldwin accepted the character of his son and champion; but no sooner was
he introduced into the city than he inflamed the people to the massacre of
his father, occupied the throne and treasure, extended his conquests over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
hills of Armenia and the plain of Mesopotamia, and founded the first principality
of the Franks or Latins, which subsisted fifty-four years beyond
the Euphrates.</p>

<h5>SIEGE OF ANTIOCH</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1097-1098 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Before the Franks could enter Syria, the summer, and even the autumn,
were completely wasted. The siege of Antioch, or the separation and repose
of the army during the winter season, was strongly debated in their council.
At the head of the Turkish emirs, Baghi Sian, a veteran chief, commanded in
the place; his garrison was composed of six or seven thousand horse, and
fifteen or twenty thousand foot. Notwithstanding strong fortifications, the
city had been repeatedly taken by the Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and
the Turks; so large a circuit must have yielded many previous points of
attack; and in a siege that was formed about the middle of October, the
vigour of the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt.
Whatever strength and valour could perform in the field was abundantly
discharged by the champions of the cross; in the frequent occasions of
sallies, of forage, of the attack and defence of convoys, they were often victorious;
and we can only complain that their exploits are sometimes enlarged
beyond the scale of probability and truth. The sword of Godfrey divided
a Turk from the shoulder to the haunch; and one half of the infidel fell to
the ground, while the other was transported by his horse to the city gate.
But the reality or report of such gigantic prowess must have taught the
Moslems to keep within their walls; and against those walls of earth or stone,
the sword and the lance were unavailing weapons.</p>

<p>Indolence or weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the
entire circuit; and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the wants
and recruited the garrison of the city. At the end of seven months, after
the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by famine, desertion, and
fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was imperceptible, and their success
remote, if the Latin Ulysses, the artful and ambitious Bohemond, had not
employed the arms of cunning and deceit. The Christians of Antioch were
numerous and discontented; Firuz, a Syrian renegado, had acquired the
favour of the emir and the command of three towers. A secret correspondence
was soon established. Bohemond declared in the council of the
chiefs that he could deliver the city into their hands. But he claimed the
sovereignty of Antioch as the reward of his service; and the proposal which
had been rejected by the envy, was at length extorted from the distress, of
his equals. The nocturnal surprise was executed by the French and Norman
princes, who ascended in person the scaling ladders that were thrown from
the wall; their new proselyte, after the murder of his too scrupulous brother,
embraced and introduced the servants of Christ; the army rushed through
the gates; and the Moslems soon found, that, although mercy was hopeless,
resistance was impotent.</p>

<p>But the citadel still refused to surrender, and the victors themselves were
speedily encompassed and besieged by the innumerable forces of Kerboga,
prince of Mosul, who with twenty-eight Turkish emirs advanced to the
deliverance of Antioch. Five-and-twenty days the Christians spent on the
verge of destruction; and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and the sultan
left them only the choice of servitude or death. In this extremity they collected
the relics of their strength, sallied from the town, and in a single
memorable day annihilated or dispersed the host of Turks and Arabians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
which they might safely report to have consisted of six hundred thousand
men. Their supernatural allies we shall proceed to consider; the human
causes of the victory of Antioch were the fearless despair of the Franks,
and the surprise, the discord, perhaps the errors, of their adversaries.</p>

<p>In the eventful period of the siege and defence of Antioch, the crusaders
were alternately exalted by victory or sunk in despair; either swelled with
plenty or emaciated with hunger. A speculative reasoner might suppose
that their faith had a strong and serious influence on their practice; and that
the soldiers of the cross, the deliverers of the Holy Sepulchre, prepared
themselves by a sober and virtuous life for the daily contemplation of martyrdom.
Experience blows away this charitable illusion; and seldom does
the history of profane war display such scenes of intemperance and prostitution
as were exhibited under the walls of Antioch. The grove of Daphne
no longer flourished; but the Syrian air was still impregnated with the
same vices; the Christians were seduced by every temptation that nature
either prompts or reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised; and
sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those scandalous disorders,
not less pernicious to military discipline, than repugnant to evangelic purity.
In the first days of the siege and the possession of Antioch, the Franks consumed
with wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence of
weeks and months; the desolate country no longer yielded a supply; and from
that country they were at length excluded by the arms of the besieging
Turks. Disease, the faithful companion of want, was envenomed by the
rains of the winter, the summer heats, unwholesome food, and the close
imprisonment of multitudes. The pictures of famine and pestilence are
always the same, and always disgustful.</p>

<p>The remains of treasure or spoil were eagerly lavished in the purchase of
the vilest nourishment; and dreadful must have been the calamities of the
poor, since, after paying three marks of silver for a goat, and fifteen for a
lean camel, the count of Flanders was reduced to beg a dinner, and Duke
Godfrey to borrow a horse. Sixty thousand horses had been reviewed in the
camp; before the end of the siege they were diminished to two thousand,
and scarcely two hundred fit for service could be mustered on the day of
battle. Weakness of body and terror of mind extinguished the ardent
enthusiasm of the pilgrims; and every motive of honour and religion was
subdued by the desire of life. Among the chiefs, three heroes may be found
without fear or reproach: Godfrey de Bouillon was supported by his magnanimous
piety; Bohemond by ambition and interest; and Tancred declared,
in the true spirit of chivalry, that as long as he was at the head of forty
knights he would never relinquish the enterprise of Palestine. But the
count of Toulouse and Provence was suspected of a voluntary indisposition;
the duke of Normandy was recalled from the sea shore by the censures of
the church; Hugh the Great, though he led the vanguard of the battle,
embraced an ambiguous opportunity of returning to France; and Stephen
count of Chartres basely deserted the standard which he bore, and the
council in which he presided. The soldiers were discouraged by the flight
of William, viscount of Melun, surnamed the Carpenter from the weighty
strokes of his axe; and the saints were scandalised by the fall of Peter the
Hermit, who attempted to escape from the penance of a necessary fast.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<h5>A TYPICAL MIRACLE</h5>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p349.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Norman Crusader</span></p>
</div>

<p>In such a cause, and in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles
were frequent and familiar. In the distress of Antioch, they were repeated
with unusual energy and success; St. Ambrose had assured a pious ecclesiastic
that two years of trial must precede the season of deliverance and grace; the
deserters were stopped by the presence and reproaches of Christ himself;
the dead had promised to arise and combat with their brethren; the Virgin
had obtained the pardon of their sins; and their confidence was revived by
a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid discovery of the holy lance. The
policy of their chiefs has on this occasion been admired, and might surely
be excused; but a pious fraud
is seldom produced by the cool
conspiracy of many persons;
and a voluntary impostor
might depend on the support
of the wise and the credulity
of the people. Of the
diocese of Marseilles, there
was a priest of low cunning
and loose manners, and his
name was Peter Bartholemy.
He presented himself at the
door of the council-chamber
to disclose an apparition of
St. Andrew which had been
thrice reiterated in his sleep,
with a dreadful menace, if
he presumed to suppress the
commands of heaven. “At
Antioch,” said the apostle, “in
the church of my brother St.
Peter, near the high altar, is
concealed the steel head of the
lance that pierced the side of
our Redeemer. In three days,
that instrument of eternal, and
now of temporal salvation, will
be manifested to his disciples.
Search and ye shall find; bear it aloft in battle, and that mystic weapon shall
penetrate the souls of the miscreants.” The pope’s legate, the bishop of Puy,
affected to listen with coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly
accepted by Count Raymond, whom his faithful subject, in the name of the
apostle, had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance.</p>

<p>The experiment was resolved; and on the third day after a due preparation
of prayer and fasting the priest of Marseilles introduced twelve trusty
spectators, among whom were the count and his chaplain; and the church
doors were barred against the impetuous multitude. The ground was
opened in the appointed place; but the workmen, who relieved each other,
dug to the depth of twelve feet without discovering the object of their
search. In the evening, when Count Raymond had withdrawn to his post,
and the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy in his shirt, and
without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the darkness of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and deposit the head of a Saracen
lance; and the first sound, the first gleam of the steel, was saluted with
a devout rapture. The holy lance was drawn from its recess, wrapped in a
veil of silk and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders; their
anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope, and the
desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm of valour.
Next day the gates of Antioch were thrown open; the battle array was
marshalled; the holy lance was carried by Raymond’s chaplain; and the
hosts of the enemy were annihilated or scattered.</p>

<p>In the season of danger and triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy of
Marseilles was unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary service
was accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal alms which the count of
Toulouse derived from the custody of the holy lance provoked the envy, and
awakened the reason, of his rivals. A Norman clerk presumed to sift, with
a philosophic spirit, the truth of the legend, the circumstances of the discovery,
and the character of the prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed
their deliverance to the merits and intercession of Christ alone. For a
while, the provincials defended their national palladium with clamours and
arms; and new visions condemned to death and hell the profane sceptics
who presumed to scrutinise the truth and merit of the discovery. The
prevalence of incredulity compelled the author to submit his life and veracity
to the judgment of God. A pile of dry fagots, four feet high, and fourteen
long, was erected in the midst of the camp; the flames burned fiercely to the
elevation of thirty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve inches was left for
the perilous trial. The unfortunate priest of Marseilles traversed the fire
with dexterity and speed; but his thighs and belly were scorched by the
intense heat; he expired the next day; and the logic of believing minds
will pay some regard to his dying protestations of innocence and truth.
Some efforts were made by the provincials to substitute a cross, a ring, or a
tabernacle, in the place of the holy lance, which soon vanished in contempt
and oblivion.</p>

<p>The prudence or fortune of the Franks had delayed their invasion till the
decline of the Turkish Empire. Under the manly government of the first
three sultans, the kingdoms of Asia were united in peace and justice; and
the innumerable armies which they led in person were equal in courage,
and superior in discipline, to the barbarians of the West. But at the time
of the crusade the inheritance of Malik Shah was disputed by his four sons.
The twenty-eight emirs, who marched with the standard of Kerboga, were
his rivals or enemies; their hasty levies were drawn from the towns and
tents of Mesopotamia and Syria; and the Turkish veterans were employed
or consumed in the civil wars beyond the Tigris. The caliph of Egypt
embraced this opportunity of weakness and discord, to recover his ancient
possessions; and his sultan Afdal besieged Jerusalem and Tyre, expelled
the children of Ortok, and restored in Palestine the civil and ecclesiastical
authority of the Fatimites. They heard with astonishment of the vast
armies of Christians that had passed from Europe to Asia, and rejoiced in
the sieges and battles which broke the power of the Turks, the adversaries
of their sect and monarchy. But the same Christians were the enemies of the
prophet; and from the overthrow of Nicæa and Antioch, the motive of
their enterprise, which was gradually understood, would urge them forwards
to the banks of the Jordan, or perhaps of the Nile. An intercourse of epistles
and embassies, which rose and fell with the events of war, was maintained
between the throne of Cairo and the camp of the Latins; and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
adverse pride was the result of ignorance and enthusiasm. The ministers
of Egypt declared in a haughty, or insinuated in a milder, tone, that their
sovereign, the true and lawful commander of the faithful, had rescued Jerusalem
from the Turkish yoke; and that the pilgrims, if they would divide
their numbers, and lay aside their arms, should find a safe and hospitable
reception at the sepulchre of Jesus. In either fortune the answer of the
crusaders was firm and uniform; they disdained to inquire into the private
claims or possessions of the followers of Mohammed; whatsoever was his
name or nation, the usurper of Jerusalem was their enemy; and instead of
prescribing the mode and terms of their pilgrimage, it was only by a timely
surrender of the city and province, their sacred right, that he could deserve
their alliance, or deprecate their impending and irresistible attack.</p>

<h5>JERUSALEM BESIEGED</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1098-1099 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Yet this attack, when they were within the view and reach of their
glorious prize, was suspended above ten months after the defeat of Kerboga.
The zeal and courage of the crusaders were chilled in the moment of victory;
and instead of marching to improve the consternation, they hastily dispersed
to enjoy the luxury of Syria. The causes of this strange delay may be
found in the want of strength and subordination. In the painful and
various service of Antioch, the cavalry was annihilated; many thousands of
every rank had been lost by famine, sickness, and desertion; the same abuse
of plenty had been productive of a third famine; and the alternation of
intemperance and distress had generated a pestilence, which swept away
above fifty thousand of the pilgrims. Few were able to command, and
none were willing to obey; and Count Raymond exhausted his troops
and treasures in an idle expedition into the heart of Syria. The winter was
consumed in discord and disorder. In the month of May, the relics of this
mighty host proceeded from Antioch to Laodicea; about forty thousand
Latins, of whom no more than fifteen hundred horse, and twenty thousand
foot, were capable of immediate service. Their easy march was continued
between Mount Libanus and the sea shore; their wants were liberally supplied
by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa; and they drew large contributions
from the emirs of Tripolis, Tyre, Sidon, Acre, and Cæsarea, who granted
a free passage and promised to follow the example of Jerusalem. From
Cæsarea they advanced into the midland country; their clerks recognised
the sacred geography of Lydda, Ramla, Emmaus, and Bethlehem, and as soon
as they descried the Holy City, the crusaders forgot their toils and claimed
their reward.</p>

<p>Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and importance
of her memorable sieges. It was not till after a long and obstinate contest
that Babylon and Rome could prevail against the obstinacy of the people,
the craggy ground that might supersede the necessity of fortifications, and the
walls and towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain. By
the experience of a recent siege, and a three years’ possession, the Saracens
of Egypt had been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy, the
defects of a place, which religion as well as honour forbade them to resign.
Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph’s lieutenant, was entrusted with the defence;
his policy strove to restrain the native Christians by the dread of their own
ruin and that of the Holy Sepulchre. His garrison is said to have consisted
of forty thousand Turks and Arabians; and if he could muster twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed that the besieged were
more numerous than the besieging army. Their siege was more reasonably
directed against the northern and western sides of the city. Godfrey de
Bouillon erected his standard on the first swell of Mount Calvary; to the
left, as far as St. Stephen’s gate, the line of attack was continued by Tancred
and the two Roberts; and Count Raymond established his quarters from the
citadel to the foot of Mount Zion, which was no longer included within
the precincts of the city. On the fifth day, the crusaders made a general
assault. By dint of brutal force, they burst the first barrier, but they
were driven back with shame and slaughter to the camp; the influence of
vision and prophecy was deadened by the too frequent abuse of those pious
stratagems; and time and labour were found to be the only means of victory.
The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled in forty days, but they were forty
days of calamity and anguish. On a Friday, at three in the afternoon,
the day and hour of the passion, Godfrey de Bouillon stood victorious on the
walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every side by the
emulation of valour; and about 460 years after the conquest of Omar,
the Holy City was rescued from the Mohammedan yoke. In the
pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had agreed to respect
the exclusive property of the first occupant; and the spoils of the great
mosque, seventy lamps and massy vases of gold and silver, rewarded the
diligence, and displayed the generosity, of Tancred.</p>

<p>A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of
the Christians; resistance might provoke, but neither age nor sex could
mollify, their implacable rage; they indulged themselves three days in a
promiscuous massacre; and the infection of the dead bodies produced an
epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems had been put to the
sword, and the harmless Jews had been burned in their synagogue, they
could still reserve a multitude of captives, whom interest or lassitude persuaded
them to spare. Of these savage heroes of the cross, Tancred alone
betrayed some sentiments of compassion; yet we may praise the more
selfish lenity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe conduct to
the garrison of the citadel.</p>

<p>The Holy Sepulchre was now free; and the bloody victors prepared to
accomplish their vow. Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and
in a humble posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud
anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the Saviour
of the world, and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument of
their redemption.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_2b1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_2b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>THE ARAB ACCOUNT</h5>

<p>It is well in a moment of such historic import as this to see how the
other side accepts the crisis. The Arab historian Ibn Guzi<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_2d1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_2d">d</a></span> wrote as follows:
“The Franks, when they set out from Antioch, numbered one million men,
of whom five hundred thousand were fit for war. The rest consisted of
workmen and those employed on the swivel-guns and other instruments
of war. They marched along the sea shore. Jerusalem at that time belonged
to the Egyptians. Their commander was named Iftikhar ad-Daulah,
or ‘the glory of the empire.’</p>

<p>“The siege lasted forty days. The Franks built two towers to command
the walls of the town, one in the direction of the gate of Sidon, the other
in that of the gates of Asbat and Amud, or the gates of the Tribes and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
the Column. The besieged succeeded in burning the tower near the gate
of Sidon; the second was brought up close to the walls. Then the Franks
set all their machines to work at the same time; attacking like one single
man, they put the Moslems to flight and entered the town by force. The
inhabitants took refuge in the mosque Alacsa and its dependencies; the
Franks, following them there, killed it is said one hundred thousand persons,
and made an equal number prisoners. They did not even spare the aged
of both sexes.</p>

<p>“In this spot immense riches were stored. They found seventy lamps,
twenty of which were of gold and the others of silver; they also carried off
a <i>tennur</i> or large silver lamp, weighing forty Syrian pounds. The Jews
they shut up in their synagogue, and burned them there. Jerusalem had
been in the power of Islam without a break since the reign of Caliph
Omar, in the sixteenth year of the Hegira (637 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). A Moslem author
named Ibn Zulak,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_2d2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_2d">d</a></span> thinking no doubt to give greater importance to this
event, declares that at the moment when the Christians entered the Holy
City the sun was eclipsed, the earth was hidden in darkness, and the
stars appeared in broad daylight.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_2d3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_2d">d</a></span></p>

<p>The Moslem poets describe the horrors of massacre in vehement terms,
bewailing the butchery of the women and the children and the fate of their
fathers who “but lately masters of Syria, now found no other refuge than
the backs of swift camels or even the entrails of the vultures!”<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>GODFREY ELECTED KING (1099 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1099-1147 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Eight days after this memorable event, which Pope Urban did not live
to hear, the Latin chiefs proceeded to the election of a king to guard and
govern their conquest in Palestine. The jealousy and ambition of Raymond
were condemned by his own followers; and the free, the just, the unanimous
voice of the army proclaimed Godfrey de Bouillon the first and most
worthy of the champions of Christendom. His magnanimity accepted a
trust as full of danger as of glory; but in a city where his Saviour had been
crowned with thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name and ensigns of
royalty; and the founder of the kingdom of Jerusalem contented himself
with the modest title of Defender and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre. His
government of a single year, too short for the public happiness, was interrupted
in the first fortnight by a summons to the field by the approach of
the vizir or sultan of Egypt, who had been too slow to prevent, but who was
impatient to avenge, the loss of Jerusalem. His total overthrow in the
battle of Askalon sealed the establishment of the Latins in Syria, and signalised
the valour of the French princes, who in this action bade a long farewell
to the holy wars.</p>

<p>After suspending before the Holy Sepulchre the sword and standard of
the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title) embraced his departing companions,
and could retain only, with the gallant Tancred, three hundred
knights and two thousand foot soldiers, for the defence of Palestine. His
sovereignty was soon attacked by a new enemy, the only one against whom
Godfrey was a coward. Adhemar, bishop of Puy, who excelled both in
council and action, had been swept away in the last plague of Antioch; the
remaining ecclesiastics preserved only the pride and avarice of their character;
and their seditious clamours had required that the choice of a bishop
should precede that of a king. The revenue and jurisdiction of the lawful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
patriarch were usurped by the Latin clergy; the exclusion of the Greeks
and Syrians was justified by the reproach of heresy or schism; and, under
the iron yoke of their deliverers, the oriental Christians regretted the tolerating
government of the Arabian caliphs. Daimbert, archbishop of Pisa, had
long been trained in the secret policy of Rome; he brought a fleet of his
countrymen to the succour of the Holy Land, and was installed, without a
competitor, the spiritual and temporal head of the church. The new patriarch
immediately grasped the sceptre which had been acquired by the toil
and blood of the victorious pilgrims; and both Godfrey and Bohemond submitted
to receive at his hands the investiture of their feudal possessions.
Nor was this sufficient; Daimbert claimed the immediate property of Jerusalem
and Joppa; instead of a firm and generous refusal, the hero negotiated
with the priest; a quarter of either city was ceded to the church; and
the modest bishop was satisfied with an eventual reversion of the rest, on the
death of Godfrey without children, or on the future acquisition of a new seat
at Cairo or Damascus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Crusader</span></p>
<p class="caption">(From an effigy on a tomb in Florence)</p>
</div>

<p>Without this indulgence, the conqueror would have been almost stripped
of his infant kingdom, which consisted only of Jerusalem and Joppa, with
about twenty villages and towns of the adjacent country. Within this narrow
verge, the Mohammedans were still lodged in some impregnable castles;
and the husbandman, the trader, and the pilgrim were exposed to daily and
domestic hostility. By the arms of Godfrey himself, and of the two Baldwins,
his brother and cousin, who succeeded to the throne, the Latins
breathed with more ease and safety; and at length they equalled, in the
extent of their dominions, though not in the millions of their subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
the ancient princes of Judah and Israel. After the reduction of the maritime
cities of Laodicea, Tripolis, Tyre, and Askalon, which were powerfully
assisted by the fleets of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and even of Flanders and
Norway, the range of sea coast from Scanderoon to the borders of Egypt was
possessed by the Christian pilgrims. If the prince of Antioch disclaimed
his supremacy, the counts of Edessa and Tripolis owned themselves the vassals
of the king of Jerusalem; the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrates;
and the four cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo were the only
relics of the Mohammedan conquests in Syria.</p>

<p>The laws and language, the manners and titles, of the French nation and
Latin church, were introduced into these transmarine colonies. The whole
legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed eleven thousand men, a slender
defence against the surrounding myriads of Saracens and Turks. But the
firmest bulwark of Jerusalem was founded on the knights of the Hospital
of St. John, and of the Temple of Solomon; on the strange association of
a monastic and military life, which fanaticism might suggest, but which policy
must approve. The flower of the nobility of Europe aspired to wear
the cross, and to profess the vows of these respectable orders; their spirit
and discipline were immortal; and the speedy donation of twenty-eight
thousand farms, or manors, enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry
and infantry for the defence of Palestine. The austerity of the convent
soon evaporated in the exercise of arms; the world was scandalised by
the pride, avarice, and corruption of these Christian soldiers. But in their
most dissolute period, the knights of the Hospital and Temple maintained
their fearless and fanatic character; they neglected to live, but they were
prepared to die, in the service of Christ; and the spirit of chivalry, the
parent and offspring of the Crusades, has been transplanted by this institution
from the Holy Sepulchre to the Isle of Malta.</p>

<p>No sooner had Godfrey de Bouillon accepted the office of supreme magistrate,
than he solicited the public and private advice of the Latin pilgrims,
who were the best skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe. From
these materials, with the counsel and approbation of the patriarchs and
barons of the clergy and laity, Godfrey composed the <i>Assize of Jerusalem</i>&mdash;a
precious monument of feudal jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by two tribunals
of unequal dignity, which were instituted by Godfrey de Bouillon
after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in person, presided in the upper
court, the court of the barons. Of those the four most conspicuous were
the prince of Galilee, the lord of Sidon and Cæsarea, and the counts of Joppa
and Tripolis, who, perhaps with the constable and marshal, were in a special
manner the compeers and judges of each other. But all the nobles who held
their lands immediately of the crown were entitled and bound to attend the
king’s court; and each baron exercised a similar jurisdiction in the subordinate
assemblies of his own feudatories. The trial by battle was established
in all criminal cases which affected the life, or limb, or honour, of any
person; and in all civil transactions, of or above the value of one mark of
silver.</p>

<p>Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of
feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is one of the most
powerful; and if those of Palestine are coeval with the First Crusade, they
may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world. Many of the pilgrims
had escaped from their lords under the banner of the cross; and it
was the policy of the French princes to tempt their stay by the assurance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
the rights and privileges of freemen. It is expressly declared in the <i>Assize
of Jerusalem</i>, that after instituting, for his knights and barons, the court of
peers, in which he presided himself, Godfrey de Bouillon established a second
tribunal, in which his person was represented by his viscount. The jurisdiction
of this inferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom;
and it was composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy
citizens, who were sworn to judge, according to the laws, of the actions and
fortunes of their equals. In the conquest and settlement of new cities, the
example of Jerusalem was imitated by the kings and their great vassals;
and above thirty similar corporations were founded before the loss of the
Holy Land. Another class of subjects, the Syrians, or oriental Christians,
were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and protected by the toleration of
the state. Godfrey listened to their reasonable prayer, that they might be
judged by their own national laws. A third court was instituted for their
use, of limited and domestic jurisdiction; the sworn members were Syrians,
in blood, language, and religion; but the office of the president (in Arabic,
of the <i>rais</i>) was sometimes exercised by the viscount of the city. At
an immeasurable distance below the nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers,
the <i>Assize of Jerusalem</i> condescends to mention the villeins and slaves, the
peasants of the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally considered
as the objects of property. The relief or protection of these unhappy
men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legislator; but he diligently
provides for the recovery, though not indeed for the punishment, of the
fugitives. Like hounds, or hawks, which had strayed from the lawful owner,
they might be lost and claimed; the slave and falcon were of the same value;
but three slaves, or twelve oxen, were accumulated to equal the price of the
war-horse; and a sum of three hundred pieces of gold was fixed, in the age
of chivalry, as the equivalent of the more noble animal.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_2b2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_2b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>RESULTS OF THE FIRST CRUSADE</h5>

<p>As if obeying the impetus it had received, the new state continued the
spirit of conquest under Godfrey’s first two successors&mdash;Baldwin I (1100-1118)
and Baldwin II of Bourg (1118-1131). But after these two reigns
decadence began in discord. The atabegs who ruled at Mosul and Damascus
took Edessa and massacred its people in 1144. There needed nothing
less than this bloody disaster, which left Palestine exposed, to drive Europe
to the renewal of crusade.</p>

<p>The First Crusade was very different from the seven others. It kindled
all Europe, profoundly stirred the masses, both people and peers, and was the
symptom of a great upheaval of sentiments and ideals. Those of the two
following centuries had not the same motive. They were almost all conducted
by kings who had kept aloof from the first; and even if faith were
never absent, politics was often superior.</p>

<p>The Second Crusade felt still a vivid reflection of the spirit of devotion
that animated the First; but it was no longer the work of the people but
of princes&mdash;the emperor Conrad III and King Louis VII of France, who
took the cross in spite of the prudent counsels of his minister, Abbé Suger.
This Crusade was preached in France and Germany by St. Bernard; but
already the zeal was somewhat chilled. A general tax levied on the whole
kingdom of France, and on every class&mdash;nobles, priests, or peasants&mdash;roused
much protest; at Sens the people killed the abbé of St. Pierre le Vif, ruler of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
part of their city, because of an impost he had wished to collect. “The
king,” said a contemporary, “started on his way in the midst of curses.”
St. Bernard had been offered the command of the expedition, but remembering
Peter the Hermit, he refused.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_2e"><a href="#crusades_endnote_2e">e</a></span></p>

<p>This Peter the Hermit, who for all his meek and lowly manner had
unhinged all Europe and led a huge rabble to the slaughter in Asia Minor,
had received an address of thanks in Jerusalem when the city had been
taken; and then retiring to his native France had built a monastery at Huy
on the Maas, where he lived quietly and died obscurely in 1115, recking
nothing of the series of bloody wars that were to follow as the aftermath
of his perfervid oratory and fanatic frenzy.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the First Crusade is a natural and simple event, while
hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise congenial to the spirit of the
times. But the obstinate perseverance of Europe may indeed excite our
pity and admiration: that no instruction should have been drawn from constant
and adverse experience; that the same confidence should have repeatedly
grown from the same failures; that six succeeding generations should
have rushed headlong down the precipice that was open before them; and
that men of every condition should have staked their public and private
fortunes on the desperate adventure of possessing or recovering a tombstone
two thousand miles from their country. In a period of two centuries after
the Council of Clermont, each spring and summer produced a new emigration
of pilgrim warriors for the defence of the Holy Land; but the seven
great armaments or crusades were excited by some impending or recent
calamity; the nations were moved by the authority of their pontiffs and
the example of their kings; their zeal was kindled, and their reason
was silenced, by the voice of their holy orators; and among these, Bernard,
the monk or the saint, may claim the most honourable place.</p>

<h5>ST. BERNARD</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1115-1147 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>About eight years before the first conquest of Jerusalem he was born of
a noble family in Burgundy; at the age of twenty-three he buried himself
in the monastery of Citeaux, then in the primitive fervour of the institution;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
at the end of two years he led forth her third colony, or daughter, to the
valley of Clairvaux in Champagne; and was content till the hour of his
death with the humble station of abbot of his own community. A philosophic
age has abolished, with too liberal and indiscriminate disdain, the
honours of these spiritual heroes. The meanest among them are distinguished
by some energies of the mind; they were at least superior to their
votaries and disciples; and in the race of superstition, they attained the
prize for which such numbers contended. In speech, in writing, in action,
Bernard stood high above his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions
are not devoid of wit and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as
much reason and humanity as may be reconciled with the character of a
saint. In a secular life he would have shared the seventh part of a private
inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance, by closing his eyes against
the visible world, by the refusal of all ecclesiastical dignities, the abbot
of Clairvaux became the oracle of Europe, and the founder of 160 convents.
Princes and pontiffs trembled at the freedom of his apostolical censures;
France, England, and Milan consulted and obeyed his judgment in
a schism of the church; the debt was repaid by the gratitude of Innocent
II; and his successor, Eugenius III, was the friend and disciple of the
holy Bernard.</p>

<p>It was in the proclamation of the Second Crusade that he shone as the
missionary and prophet of God, who called the nations to the defence of
the Holy Sepulchre. At the parliament of Vézelay he spoke before the king;
and Louis VII, with his nobles, received their crosses from his hand. The
abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less easy conquest of the emperor
Conrad; a phlegmatic people, ignorant of his language, was transported by
the pathetic vehemence of his tone and gestures; and his progress from
Constance to Cologne was the triumph of eloquence and zeal. Bernard applauds
his own success in the depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities
and castles were emptied of their inhabitants; and computes that only one
man was left behind for the consolation of seven widows. The blind fanatics
were desirous of electing him for their general; but the example of
the hermit Peter was before his eyes; and while he assured the crusaders
of the divine favour, he prudently declined a military command in which
failure and victory would have been almost equally disgraceful to his
character.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3b"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3b">b</a></span></p>

<p>In the consternation throughout Palestine which the fall of Edessa
occasioned, all classes of people beckoned their compatriots in the West.
The news of the loss of the eastern frontier of the Latin kingdom reached
France at a time peculiarly favourable for foreign war. After having
reduced his vassal the count of Champagne to obedience, Louis VII the
French king exceeded the usual cruelty of conquerors, and instead of sheathing
his sword, when the inhabitants of Vetri submitted, he set fire to a church,
to which more than thirteen hundred of them had fled for refuge. His sacrilegious
barbarity excited the indignation of the clergy and laity. A fit of
sickness calmed his passions; his conscience accused and condemned him,
and he resolved to expiate his sins by a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Louis
VII was the first sovereign prince who engaged himself to fight under the
banner of the cross. The news of the calamities in Palestine quickened his
holy resolution, and like other men he was impetuously moved by the eloquence
of St. Bernard, the great oracle of the age.</p>

<p>The wish of Louis for a crusade was applauded by Pope Eugenius III.
His intention was pronounced to be holy; and Bernard was ordered to travel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
through France and Germany, and preach a plenary indulgence to those who
followed the royal example. Eugenius wrote to the faithful sons of the
church, urging them to cross the seas to Palestine. The first crusaders had
provoked the wrath of heaven by their dissoluteness and folly; but the new
soldiers of Christ ought to travel simple in dress, and disdaining the luxury
of falcons and dogs of the chase. As Peter had represented the scandal
of suffering the sacred places to remain in the hands of the infidels,
the eloquent Bernard thundered from the pulpit the disgrace of allowing a
land which had been recovered from pollution again to sink into it. He was
admitted to the thrones of princes, as well as to the pulpits of their churches;
to public assemblies and to private meetings. In a parliament held at
Vézelay, in the season of Easter, 1146, Louis was confirmed in his pious
resolve; and having on his knees received the holy symbol, he joined with
Bernard in moving the barons and knights to save the sanctuary of David
from the hands of the Philistines. No house could contain the multitude;
they assembled in the fields and Bernard addressed them from a lofty pulpit.
As at the Council of Clermont, so on this occasion shouts of “<i>Deus id vult</i>”
rent the skies; the crosses which the man of God had brought with him
to the meeting fell far short of the number of enthusiasts; and he therefore
tore his simple monkish garment into small pieces, and affixed them to the
shoulders of his kneeling converts. The successful incendiary then crossed
the Rhine; and every city and village from Constance to Carinthia echoed the
call to war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1147-1148 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But the emperor Conrad III made a long and firm denial. As politics
prevented the exercise of religious fervour, the preacher endeavoured to
impress him with the belief that were he in arms for the kingdom of God,
heaven would protect his kingdom in Europe. Still the emperor wanted
faith; but when the holy orator, in a moment of peculiar energy, drew
an animated picture of the proceedings of the day of judgment, of the punishments
which would be inflicted on the idle, and the rewards which would be
showered upon the Christians militant, then it was that conviction flashed
across the mind of the royal auditor; and the profession was made that the
lord of the Germans knew and would perform his duty to the church.
Encouraged by this example, the barons and people flew to arms.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Mainz was the rendezvous of the French crusaders, and Ratisbon of
those from Germany. The French levies were of priests, of people, and of
soldiers; and of the last class the number of men armed with the helmet
and coat of mail was seventy thousand. The civil wars of England had
been closed by the weakness of all parties; but some of the nobility, restless
when not engaged in deeds of blood, joined themselves to the force of Louis.
Conrad had an army quite as large and formidable, with a due proportion of
light-armed men, and simple pilgrims. The enthusiasm of the crusade realised
the dreams of romancers, and heroines as well as heroes had prepared
themselves to make war upon the paynim brethren. A considerable troop
of women rode among the Germans; they were arrayed with the spear and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
shield, but (like Virgil’s Camilla) some love of usual delights had mingled
itself with the desire of great exploits, for they were remarkable by the
splendour of their dress, and the bold leader was called “the golden-footed
dame.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The emperor marched through Hungary and solicited the friendship
of the Grecian court.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/fp3.jpg" width="650" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ST. BERNARD FEEDING THE POOR</p>
</div>

<p>Manuel, the grandson of Alexius, was on the throne, and although like
his ancestor he beheld with secret dread the armaments of Europe, yet for
the protection of his subjects he entered into a treaty with Conrad for the
regular purchase and sale of provisions. There was frequent matter of
charge and recrimination between the Greeks and the Germans in the march
of the latter to Constantinople; and circumstances occasioned many negotiations
between the two emperors. But Conrad apprehended the duplicity
of Manuel, and in indignation at the Grecian’s infraction of the treaty relating
to intercourse, he crossed the Bosporus without meeting or conferring
with the emperor.</p>

<p>Manuel received the king of France as an equal. He met him in the
court of his palace, and after mutual embraces conducted him into an apartment,
where they sat with equal dignity. In the midst of feasts and public
rejoicings the French monarch learned that the emperor and the sultan of
Iconium were in correspondence. The impatience of the barons and knights
to visit Jerusalem overcame every suggestion to revenge, and made them
think that the defence of the Holy Land, and not the destruction of the
Greek Empire, was the object for which they had taken up arms. But there
were not wanting men who urged that the time was arrived for removing the
barrier between Europe and Asia.</p>

<h5>DISASTERS OF THE GERMANS</h5>

<p>The passage through Bithynia completed, Conrad entered Lycaonia, the
heart of the dominions of the Seljuk Turks. The sultan had assembled from
every quarter of his states all the troops that could possibly be brought into
the field, and the number was so great that the rivers could not satisfy their
thirst or the country furnish provisions. The imperial guides conducted the
objects of their care either through deserts where the soldiers perished from
hunger, or led them into the jaws of the Moslems. In their occasional transactions,
the bread which the crusaders purchased was mixed with chalk,
and various other cruel frauds were practised by the Greeks. The assaults
of the Turks were incessant. The staff of the pilgrim was a poor defence
from a scimitar, and the heavily armed Germans could not retreat from the
activity of the Tatars. Only a tenth part of the soldiers and palmers that
had left the banks of the Danube and the Rhine escaped the arrows of the
Moslems, and with their commander secured their retreat to the French
army. Louis had been lulled into security by the flattering assurances of
Manuel that Conrad, so far from standing in need of succour, had even defeated
the Turks and taken Iconium. The French king was lying in camp
on the borders of the lake near Nicæa, when some wretched German fugitives
arrived with news of the perfidy of the Greeks, and the triumph of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
Moslems. The allied monarchs soon met and consulted on the road which
the champions of the cross should take. They united their crusaders, turned
aside from the path which had been trodden by the feudal princes of Europe,
and marched in concert as far as Philadelphia in Lydia; but the Germans
had lost their baggage, and on a prospect
of new calamities, many returned
to Constantinople, and near Ephesus
(to which place the army directed its
course) the emperor himself embarked,
and went to Jerusalem by ship.</p>

<h5>THE FRENCH FAILURE</h5>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p362.jpg" width="250" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dubbing a Knight on the Field of Battle</span></p>
</div>

<p>The French recruited themselves
on the shores of the Ægean Sea, and
pursued their march in an easterly
direction. They rejected with disdain
an offer of Manuel of a protection from
Moslem fury, and they gallantly kept
up their course with the usual portion
of suffering, till they arrived at the
banks of the Mæander. They found
there the Turks, who having safely deposited
their spoils came to dispute with
the Latins the passage of the river. The
battle was not of long duration; the
French made so great a slaughter of
their foe, that the bones of the Moslems
were conspicuous for years. The crusaders
proceeded in good order and discipline
through the town of Laodicea,
into the barrier mountains between
Phrygia and Pisidia. The vanguard
of the army advanced beyond the appointed
rendezvous. The rearguard, in
which was the king, moved forwards
with perfect confidence that the heights
before them were in possession of their
friends. Their ravenous enemy, who always hovered round them, seized the
moment when the ranks of the Christians were divided, and casting aside their
bows and arrows, fell upon them with tumultuous rapidity, sword in hand. It
was in a defile of the mountains that the Turkish tempest burst on the Latin
troops. Rocks ascending to the clouds were above the crusaders, and fathomless
precipices beneath them. The French could not recover from the shock
and horror of the surprise. Men, horses, and baggage were cast into the
abyss. The Turks were innumerable and irresistible. The life of the king
was saved more by fortune than by skill. He escaped to an eminence with a
few soldiers, and in the deep obscurity of the night made his way to the advanced
guard. The snows of winter, deficiency of stores, and the refusal of
the Greeks to trade with them, were the evils with which the French had to
contend. They marched, or rather wandered, for they knew not the roads,
and the discipline of the army was broken. They arrived at Attalia (Adalia),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
the metropolis of Pamphylia, seated on the sea shore near the mouth of the
Cestrus. But the unchristian Greeks refused hospitality to the enemies of
the infidel name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1148-1149 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Famine had so dreadfully thinned the ranks of the army, and so many
horses and other beasts of burden had perished, that the most sage and prudent
among the crusaders advised their companions to turn aside from scenes
of desolation, and proceed by sea to Antioch. The king and his soldiers
embarked for Antioch. The way-worn pilgrims and the sick were committed
to the charge of Thierry, count of Flanders, who was to march with
them to Cilicia. But when Louis quitted the harbour, the Turks fell upon
the Christians who were left behind, and the escort was found to be feeble
and ineffective. The people of Attalia not only declined to open their gates,
but even murdered the sick. Every day the Turks killed hundreds of the
pilgrims, and as it was evident that flight alone could save the remainder,
Thierry escaped by sea. Seven thousand wretched votaries of the cross
attempted to surmount the higher difficulties of the land journey to Jerusalem;
but the Holy City never opened to their view, and in perishing under
Moslem vengeance they thought that the loss of the completion of the pilgrimage
was compensated by the glories of martyrdom.</p>

<p>The nobility, the clergy, and people of Antioch received the French king
with every demonstration of respect; but no blandishments of persuasion or
petulant threats of divorce from his wife Eleanora, could move Louis from
his purpose of marching into Palestine. He repaired to the Holy City;
entered it in religious procession, while crowds of ecclesiastics and laymen
were singing the psalm, “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.”
His arrival had been preceded by that of the emperor of Germany, the dukes
of Saxony and Bavaria, and the ruined German band.</p>

<p>A council was held at Ptolemais, composed of the princes, barons, and
prelates of Syria and Palestine, and the new commanders from Europe.
The misfortunes of the Edessenes were forgotten, or yielded to higher feelings,
for though the recapture of the principality of the Courtenais was the
great object of the crusade, yet there were Moslem cities in Syria far more
dangerous to Jerusalem than the remote city of Edessa. The decree for a
march to Damascus was passed, and the emperor of Germany and the kings
of France and Jerusalem brought their troops into the field; but the best
disciplined parts of the army were the knights of the Temple and St. John.
Eager to relieve Damascus from the yoke under which she had groaned for
nearly five centuries, the champions of Christianity soon arrived under her
walls. Numerous and of long continuance were the engagements between
the Latins and the Syrians. The city was apparently in the power of the
crusaders, and the people abandoned themselves to despair. But instead of
taking possession of Damascus the Latins anticipated the event and thought
only to whom the prize should be given. Much time was wasted in intrigues,
and after sustaining for a short time the sallies of reinforcements, and rejecting
in a council of war the advice of some unsubdued spirits for an attack
on Askalon, the Christian army raised the siege of Damascus, and retrograded
to Jerusalem in sorrow and in shame. Conrad soon returned to Europe with
the shattered relics of the German host, and his steps were a year afterwards
traced by the French king, the queen, and most of the French lords.</p>

<p>Among the few men whose virtues and abilities spread some rays of moral
and intellectual light over the twelfth century was Suger, the abbot of the
celebrated religious fraternity of St. Denis, in France. Strongly imbued
with the superstition of his time, his fondest wish was for the overthrow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
the Moslems. As minister of Louis VII, however, he had exposed to his
royal master the embarrassment of the state finances, the fierce and menacing
aspect of the crown vassals, and other circumstances of a political nature, to
deter him from quitting his dominions. But the spirit of romantic devotion
in the heir of Charlemagne could not be quenched, and Louis well consulted
the interests of his kingdom in delivering the sceptre to the charge of the
abbot of St. Denis. After his return from Palestine, the king ardently
wished to recross the seas, and by martial achievements to obliterate the
memory of former disasters. When all thoughts of a crusade had apparently
died away, France was astonished at the appearance of a martial missionary
in the person of him who had opposed the second holy war. The clergy of
the East implored Suger to restore the fortunes of the Holy Land, knowing
that he possessed more credit in France than all the other princes and prelates,
and that his piety equalled his authority. Papal benediction was bestowed
upon him, though the pope was at first amazed at the enthusiasm of a
man nearly seventy years of age; but his influence was exerted in vain.
Angry at the timidity of his countrymen, his own courage rose; he resolved
to conduct a small army to Palestine himself, and his reliance on the favour
of heaven made him hope that the vassals of St. Denis alone would be more
powerful than the congregated myriads of Europe. All aspirations for glory
were humbled by a fever; he died at St. Denis, and his successor in the
abbacy pursued the usual duties of his station, without superadding those of
a martial description.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3c1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>THE FALL OF THE KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1149-1154 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The very question that had proved a stumbling-block to the Germano-Roman
world, namely, the right of women to succeed to the throne, also kept
the knightly ecclesiastical colony of the kingdom of Jerusalem in perpetual
unrest. War broke out between Melusina&mdash;who, assuming the management
of public affairs at the death of her husband Fulk, gave great power
into the hands of her cousin, the constable of Manassa&mdash;and her son, King
Baldwin III, around whom rallied a number of barons, all ill-disposed to
acknowledge the new rule. The feud was fought out by the mother and son
near the Holy Sepulchre in 1152, with the result that Melusina was obliged
to relinquish all her pretensions.</p>

<p>Hodierna, Melusina’s sister, on the other hand, was given guardianship
over her youngest son, after the murder of her husband, Raymond I of Tripolis.
The remainder of the countship of Edessa passed to Greece, by reason
of a pact which assured to the widowed countess and her children a considerable
income; Jocelyn II was taken prisoner by the Turkomans and died in
captivity. Raymond of Antioch had also been killed while bravely fighting
in 1149, and his widow Constantia now became the object of the liveliest contention.
It was at first feared that she would listen to the many proposals
made to her by Greeks; but when she finally accepted the French knight,
Rainald de Chatillon, a struggle broke out between him and the patriarchs,
who had hitherto held the preponderance of power, laming the forces of both
sides. Under such circumstances there could be as little thought of establishing
one solid supremacy and power in the Orient as of accomplishing a
like result in France at the same period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1154-1163 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The wonder was that there had actually risen to prominence on the side
of the Abbasids and Seljuks, during the late struggles for the possession of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
Aleppo, Edessa, and Damascus, a well-consolidated might&mdash;that of the atabegs
of Mosul, who disposed of a particularly warlike element in the Kurds, with
whom their borders were overrun from the north. Nur ad-Din vigorously
pursued the policy laid down by his father, Zenki. He was by far the more
capable and enlightened of the two; since the days of the Omayyads,
so historians tell us, there had been no prince so liberal and law-abiding,
and there never reigned one more just. Four times each week he
sat in judgment. He made no personal use of the state revenues, looking
upon them as a sacred trust placed in his hands to be expended for the public
good. He was equally zealous in the conduct of the holy war. All the
dust that settled on his shoes and garments during his various battles against
unbelievers, he caused to be collected in a sack which was to be placed
under his head when he was dead. As already related, he conquered
Damascus (1154), which was under the rule of a weak prince who had in
vain sought safety on the side of the Christians, and took up his residence
in the immediate neighbourhood of that kingdom. He was a brave and
worthy representative of the Abbasid caliphate, which he had formerly
served in the capacity of Emir al-Omara. At times the Christians rallied
for a successful feat of arms, and under the sacred symbol of the cross,
which after preliminary worship in the king’s tent they gave into the keeping
of the archbishop of Tyre, they even inflicted defeat on Nur ad-Din
(1158). Also Baldwin III, who died in 1162 at the age of thirty-three,
achieved some fame and several victories. He was brave and circumspect&mdash;in
every way a fit man for the particular kind of warfare he was
obliged to carry on. Still it was not in these battles alone that the real
issue lay; the result was determined as much by the weakness of the Fatimites
in Egypt as by the strength of the atabegs in Syria.</p>

<p>Neither had the power of the Ismailite doctrines, founded on those in
circulation before the beginning of the Fatimite caliphate, suffered any diminution;
rather it had recently taken on a new form in the most singular
and hideous of all religious sects. Who has not heard of the Assassins and
of their leader, the Old Man of the Mountain? Unlike the Sunnite caliphate
which had been restored to power by the victories of the great Seljuk sultans,
the sect founded by the Persian, Hassan, towards the end of the eleventh
century, rose to prominence by reason of teachings based on the extremest
Ismailite beliefs, and compounded of fanaticism, sensuality, and blind obedience,
which raised up men to be assassins and general instruments of terror.
Mainly by the agency of that Ridwan of Aleppo who fought with the crusaders
before Antioch, and wavered in allegiance between the Abbasids and
the Fatimites, there was planted in northwestern Syria a colony of Assassins
which, under the rule of a certain sheikh, Al-Jebel, grew to occupy an important
place in history&mdash;if such can be said of a purely destructive principle.
It was by the Assassins that Raymond of Tripolis was slain. But their dagger
struck Moslem as well as Christian, Shiite as well as Sunnite, since a foe
of their nature lies outside all partisanship&mdash;is in fact beyond the pale of
any human ordinance.</p>

<p>That the Fatimite caliphate profited nothing by this latest religious
movement is apparent from the symptoms of decay that shortly afterward
began to be manifest. The caliphs themselves were given over to a life
of luxury and disorder, and vizirs, who bore the title of sultan, were constantly
engaged in quarrels with each other, in which right was decided by
might alone. The conditions were similar to those which preceded the fall
of the Abbasid caliphate in the tenth century. In the year 1163 the sultan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
and vizir Shawer was deposed and supplanted by his rival Dargham, who
enjoyed for some time the fruits of his usurpation. But Shawer eventually
returned, and with him the emir and Kurd chieftain, Shirkuh, whom Nur
ad-Din, regardless of religious differences, had sent to his assistance.
Dargham was murdered and Shawer again assumed the sultanate, but he
could not reconcile himself to fulfilling
the promise he had made the Kurds,
that he would pay over to them one
third of the revenues of Egypt. To
protect himself more fully against his
extortionate allies, he besought assistance
of Almeric, king of Jerusalem,
brother and successor of Baldwin III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1163-1168 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Inheriting the desire of Baldwin I
for ascendency in Egypt, Baldwin III
had besieged and taken Askalon in
1153. The garrison had defended itself
ably, even to the point of driving
back a body of Templars that had
penetrated within the walls, and the
king had reason to believe that all was
lost. But the support of the Jerusalem
patriarchs enabled him to press the
siege, and a successful sally on the part
of the knights of St. John, who with
their grand master had been particularly
active, finally placed Askalon at
his mercy. At this the inhabitants, in
despair, having received no reinforcements
from either Damascus or Egypt,
called upon their military commander
to surrender. Without doubt Almeric
(1162-1173) was the most important
of the later kings of Jerusalem. Like
Louis VII he was tireless, despite his
corpulence, in the hunt and in war, and
took no pleasure in any kind of diversion. In theological questions he often
revealed an acuteness that brought his prelates to confusion; with a firm
hand he held the troublesome barons in subjection, even giving precedence
over them to certain newly arrived Franks&mdash;Milo de Plancy, for example.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p366.jpg" width="250" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Italian Armour, Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries</span></p>
</div>

<p>It could escape no one that there was danger to the kingdom in allowing
the Kurds of Nur ad-Din to become firmly established in Egypt. Losing no
time in reflection, Almeric took decisive steps at once, and fortune so far
favoured him that he succeeded in confining the Kurds within Pelusium
(1164); he was obliged to grant them a free withdrawal, however, in consequence
of domestic troubles that had befallen Nur ad-Din. A Christian
knight addressed Shirkuh, who was striding with uplifted axe behind his
followers: “Think you we do not mean to keep our pact with you?”
“You dare not break it!” was the reply.</p>

<p>No sooner had they returned home than the Kurds began preparations
for a second and greater expedition; Shirkuh incited the Sunnites to
wrath against the perfidious caliph in Cairo, and in 1167 he set out for
Egypt. Almeric also assembled his forces at the same time, and in Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
the native populations consolidated with the Pullanes in a formal alliance.
That the caliph might be encouraged by the support of their presence, the
Christian delegates were conducted into the palace. Scarcely could they
repress their admiration and astonishment at the wonders that everywhere
met their gaze. When they arrived in a splendid hall that was divided in
the middle by a curtain embroidered in gold and pearls, the vizir prostrated
himself and went through the form of taking a solemn oath; at the conclusion
of this ceremony the curtain was drawn aside and the figure of the
caliph was revealed. From his golden chair he extended his right hand to
the Christian knights, but the hand was enveloped in a veil. Hugo of
Cæsarea objected that in entering upon a pact both sides must act with
perfect fairness and good faith; whereupon the caliph uncovered his hand,
but with exceeding ill grace, as though his royal dignity had been affronted.
To the Christian knights was entrusted the defence of the walls and towers
of Cairo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1168 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Compelled to abandon his position opposite Cairo on the left bank of
the Nile, Shirkuh withdrew his forces in the direction of Upper Egypt.
Almeric pursued him hotly at the head of a mixed band of Frankish and
oriental troops, such as were never again brought together in that land until
the time of Napoleon. The two armies met in the pass of Babein. Shirkuh
was about to cross over to the other side of the river with the intention
of fleeing into the regions beyond, when a mameluke of Nur ad-Din
overtook him and exclaimed: “What, you who rejoice in all the blessings
of Islam are about to fly from the enemy? Do you not know that the
atabegs will take from the Kurds all the lands they may find on the other
side?” Thus it came about that Shirkuh remained where he was, and taking
up his position with a picked band of men on the right flank of the main
body of his troops, he overcame the king while the latter was making an attack
on the enfeebled centre. So hard was Almeric beset that he could scarcely
cut his way back to his own forces. He retained sufficient power, however,
to surround and harass Alexandria, which Shirkuh had left in the charge of
his nephew, Saladin, the son of Eyyub. Shirkuh was induced to conclude a
peace, according to the terms of which both sides, Christians as well as Kurds,
were obliged to evacuate Egypt. As the price of this concession Shirkuh
received from Shawer fifty thousand pieces of gold, while to the Christians,
so Abulfeda tells us, were promised a special magistracy in Cairo and an
important yearly revenue.</p>

<p>It is well to contemplate closely these events, as they offer not only
the final standpoint from which to judge the kingdom of Jerusalem, but the
highest and best from which to take cognisance of the entire Christian world
of that time in its relation to Islam. The main fact derived by history is
that the establishment of the Franks in the Orient was made possible only
by the antagonism that subsisted between the Abbasid and Fatimite dynasties;
so long as this antagonism continued the colonial kingdom could be
upheld, but let it once subside and the whole structure would fall to the
ground. At the period of which we write the Cairo caliphate had sunk into a
state of impotency and demoralisation; in order to prevent its falling into
the hands of the Mohammedans of Syria the kings of Jerusalem must either
take forceful possession of Egypt themselves, or must sustain it in its present
show of independence by the most rigid political conjunction. For the first
course they were far too weak, as the sequel showed, and as might have been
expected from a study of the circumstances by which they were surrounded;
but for the second they possessed quite sufficient strength, as was evidenced by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
the successes of Almeric. Indeed in all respects this was the better course to
pursue, since by the exercise of a moderate degree of wisdom affairs would
doubtless, even in the natural course of events, so have shaped themselves
that to the Christian element would gradually fall a peaceful sovereignty
over the whole realm of Egypt. What a position in the world would have
been gained to the Latin races by such a solution! Entrance into all the
Indian waters would have been open to the Italian sea powers, and it was
furthermore to be expected that northern Africa, cut off entirely from the
powers of the East, would eventually fall into the
hands of the Spaniards or of the Sicilian Normans.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not to be denied, however, that mankind
at that period was not yet ripe to exercise complete
ascendency either over the Orient or over
any other considerable portion of the world. The
religions of both divisions of humanity permitted
not the slightest compromise with unbelievers,
and the very factors that had brought about the
first amazing successes later acted as a check on
the progress of their cause towards complete fulfilment.
It seemed to be self-evident that no kind
of serious alliance could ever permanently subsist
between the crusaders and the caliphs; nay,
there was something almost against nature in
the thought of Christians defending the towers
of Cairo on behalf of infidels in a struggle of
Moslem against Moslem. Religious antagonism
was stronger in the guardians of the Holy Sepulchre
than loyalty and good faith.</p>

<p>Almeric united with Manuel of Byzantium,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
who had already formed a league with the Lombards
and the pope, and allowed himself to be
drawn into a joint scheme of conquest in Egypt.
This union between Greeks and Latins was
the more easily effected inasmuch as the king
had married a Greek and the emperor a Syrian
princess. The idea of the expedition seems to
have emanated from Manuel who, in his all-embracing
policy, kept a constant watch on both
East and West, in search of undertakings that
might promise him success. Influence was brought to bear on Almeric to
gain his consent by the grand-master of the knights of St. John; but the
Templars were strongly opposed to the project, seeing in it a shameful
violation of the peace.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the arrival of the Greek forces, the Christians of
Jerusalem opened the war in November, 1168. They took Pelusium, and
advanced on Cairo&mdash;at a very slow rate of progress, to be sure, as they
were awaiting ransom for a son of Shawer, whom they had taken prisoner.
The ransom was brought them, but at the same time they learned that the
invincible Shirkuh had set out from his desert in their direction. Both
Shawer and the caliph had overcome their former repugnance and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
addressed an appeal for aid to Nur ad-Din. Thus the supporters of the two
caliphs came together in a coalition similar to that formed by the Greeks and
Latins. The bravest and hardiest Turkomans composed the troops led by
Shirkuh and Saladin. Almeric had courageously advanced into the desert
to meet them, but Shirkuh passed him by; it was destined that the Franks
should depart from Egypt in dishonour. And now fate hurried events on to
the climax. Arrived in Jerusalem Shirkuh and Saladin opened hostilities
with the sultan, Shawer, who was accused of having plotted to murder the
Turkoman emirs. An opportunity was given Saladin to become possessed of
the sultan’s person on the occasion of a visit the latter made to the grave
of a Moslem saint. The caliph gave his consent to the captive’s execution,
and was further persuaded to appoint Shirkuh his vizir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1169-1174 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>On the death of Shirkuh, shortly after, Saladin acceded to the vacant
post (1169). He looked upon himself as in truth the chief power under
Nur ad-Din, who persistently urged him to overthrow the Fatimite caliphate.
But Saladin shrewdly withheld compliance<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> until he had obtained complete
possession of the capital and had rid himself of all his enemies, even delaying
until the Fatimite Aladid, who was still young, fell sick unto death. He
died in 1171 and Saladin, who had meanwhile repulsed an attack by Almeric
and a Byzantine fleet from Damietta, and torn from the Franks the harbour
of Ailah, on the Red Sea, took possession of the entire treasure of the
Fatimites and became master over all Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1174-1181 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A momentary advantage accrued to the Christians from this usurpation,
inasmuch as a continuance of friendly relations between the new master of
the Nile and his supreme chief, the atabeg in Damascus, was not to be
thought of. Saladin immediately sought to cut himself loose from all allegiance
to Nur ad-Din. That no hostages might be left in the hands of the
atabeg ruler, he caused his entire family to come to him in Egypt, giving to
his aged father, Eyyub, the post of guardian of his treasure. Nur ad-Din
first conceived suspicions as to his subordinate’s fealty when the latter refused
to assist him in conquering certain Frankish settlements that guarded the route
from Damascus to Egypt. He was stricken by death, however (1174), in the
midst of preparations for an expedition that was to punish the faithless emir.
Now Saladin’s plans took on wider expansion, and his aspirations soared to
greater heights. Nur ad-Din had left behind him but one minor son, Malik
as-Salih, and it was his name that appeared on the coins Saladin at first caused
to be struck off. But the Syrians were highly dissatisfied with the rule that
had succeeded that of Nur ad-Din, and were inclined to welcome Saladin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
whenever he should present himself among them. Without drawing sword
he entered Damascus in 1174, and Emesa, Hama, and Baalbek also fell into
his power. Malik as-Salih was allowed to retain Aleppo on condition that
he should withdraw from Damascus. At his death (1181) Saladin gained
possession of Aleppo and little by little extended his territory as far as
Mesopotamia; eventually the entire heritage of Nur ad-Din fell into his
hands.</p>

<p>In this manner there arose in the course of a few years a might that,
springing as it did from a union of Egypt and Syria, threatened great
danger to the Christians, and even placed in question the further existence
of the many Frankish colonies that were scattered about the Orient. The
forces at the command of the consolidated power were trained to obey the
slightest gesture of a single chief, and were saturated with the doctrines of
a single religion. Of lateral religious branches there was no longer any
question, save as they still survived in the sect of the Assassins of Lebanon,
whose leader, the Old Man of the Mountain, occasionally instigated some
fresh disturbance. Saladin himself was one day set upon by three assailants,
but his strong arm successfully defended his life. He immediately
thereafter started out to exterminate the Assassins, and devastated their
entire domains, making his name a terror wherever he went. All Saladin’s
prowess and success was the outgrowth of a remarkable personality. Like
Zenki and Nur ad-Din, he was a devout Mohammedan; it was even his
custom to read the <i>Koran</i> to armies about to rush upon each other in battle.
He scrupulously made up for all fasts that he missed, and never failed to
say the five prayers through to the end. He drank nothing but water, wore
garments of harsh wool, and allowed himself to be summoned before the bar
of judgment. He personally instructed his children in the tenets of Islam;
but his own close observance of religion did not prevent him from unlawfully
usurping power. When fortune favoured him, as on the achievement
of some brilliant victory, he delighted in exhibiting a certain careless magnanimity
that greatly enhanced the majesty of his bearing. In misfortune
he was steadfast and patient, never once turning aside from the aim he had
in view. He was brave and crafty, contriving to win for himself supporters
even among the ranks of his enemies, and he governed his subjects with
justice and moderation. As a ruler he possessed all the qualities necessary
to accomplish the building up of a state and its conservation in prosperity
and power; and to a far greater degree than had the atabegs he became the
hero of reconstructed Islam, the man of fate in the destinies of the kingdom
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Had the Christians then but known how to make the most of the little
time that was left them, all might yet have been well; but it is not to be
denied that simultaneously with the rise of the new oriental might occurred
the rapid and shameful decay of the Christian administration in the East.
The western laws of succession which had been transplanted in full force,
and which secured the throne to the direct line of descent whether male or
female, dealt the finishing blow to the tottering kingdom. In a community
of which the head should be above all a military commander, where the
commonweal could be secured only by holding the whole state in constant
readiness for war, the rule frequently fell into the hands of feeble, incompetent
youths, the whole question of succession was repeatedly and violently
reopened by the marriages of female heirs to the throne; and regencies
were successively established, disputed, and destroyed. There was no
permanent, inflexible power to hold in check the inordinate ambition of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
knights, and a general lawlessness prevailed that penetrated to every rank
of political and religious life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1173-1185 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Almeric died before Nur ad-Din in 1173. He was succeeded by his thirteen-year-old
son, Baldwin IV, who was a victim to the terrible disease of
leprosy, and up to the time of his early death in 1185 never really came into
possession of the rule. During the first part of his reign Raymond II of
Tripolis, son of Hodierna, acted as vicegerent, and in 1175 he concluded a
truce with Saladin by which he bound himself not to oppose the latter in
any of his struggles for the succession of Nur ad-Din. It was this act that
lost for Raymond all his authority in the realm. The knights now looked
towards the West for a ruler more to their liking, and Longaspada, marquis
of Montferrat, arrived among them in answer to their summons in October,
1176, shortly afterward marrying Sybilla, the eldest sister of the minor king.
He had firmly established himself in the respect and confidence of all when his
untimely death occurred (1177). His successor was Philip of Flanders and
Vermandois, a former adversary of Henry II of England and an adherent of
Becket, who was obliged to make this pilgrimage to Jerusalem in expiation
of certain violent acts he had committed. There was some reluctance
felt at placing the government in the hands of this prince, the general
opinion being that only one who was bound by self-interest to the kingdom
could effectually serve it. Philip was willing either to assume the authority
himself or to relinquish it into the hands of the count of Bethune, provided
the latter would cede to him certain possessions in the vicinity. The project
had been formed of organising, in alliance with the Greeks, an expedition
against Saladin; but Philip proved to be totally inadequate to the command
of such an enterprise, and returned home without having performed a single
act of moment.</p>

<p>A prince who fulfilled in all respects the requirements of the knights
next assumed the vicegerency, Rainald of Chatillon, who had taken part in
the siege of Askalon, and was afterwards chosen as husband and the guardian
of her son by Constantia, widow of Raymond of Antioch. In this noble were
represented all the warlike tendencies of the times. He defeated Saladin in
November, 1178, near Askalon, as he had only a short time previously
defeated Saladin’s brother, Turan Shah, near Damascus. A breathing space
fell to the kingdom after these victories that was utilised to construct near
Paneas, on the Jordan, a citadel which was entrusted to the Templars to
defend. Near this very place, however, Saladin achieved a victory over the
Christians in a battle wherein fell the grand master of the Templars, Odo
de St. Amand. On his death Saladin laid siege to the stronghold and carried
it by storm. The defeated Templars sought death by remaining behind in
the burning citadel, plunging into the waters of the Jordan, or precipitating
themselves from the top of a steep cliff.</p>

<p>About this time the bishops of the oriental Latin church began to assume
prominence in the Council of Lateran; among them being Archbishop
William of Tyre, historian of the kingdom, who in chronicling the defeat of
the Templars employed the language of the Bible: “The Lord, their God,
departed from them.” The eyes of all were now turned towards the West.
Nothing would have so fully met the aspirations of Alexander III as another
crusade, entered upon in the spirit that had marked that of Urban II;
shortly before his death he even caused a petition to be drawn up urging
the advisability of such an undertaking. It was then generally assumed that
in case the two great western monarchs, the kings of England and France,
should again decide to invade the Orient, they could count on the support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
and assistance of the emperor Manuel, who had maintained friendly relations
with the Christians of Syria while engaging in fresh wars with the Seljuks
of Asia Minor. Most reluctantly had he given up the expedition against
Egypt, even after Saladin had made himself master of the land; he could not
have been induced to do so at all, in fact, had not the knights of Jerusalem
been so tardy in rendering aid. Unfortunately for the Christian cause he
died in the year 1180; conditions in the West at that time were also
unfavourable to the undertaking of any
important enterprise, Frederick I being
deeply engaged in war with Henry the
Lion and in negotiations for a treaty with
the Lombards while the sons of Henry II
kept France and England in a state of constant
turmoil. Thus the kingdom of Jerusalem,
being deprived of all hope of outside
aid, was thrown completely on its own resources.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p372.jpg" width="200" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Crusader of the Second Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>Life was not utterly intolerable there,
nor was hope definitively abandoned so long
as Saladin was kept from entering into
possession of the entire inheritance of
Nur ad-Din. The knights still gained an
occasional victory over him, as in the plain
of Belveir and Ferbelet in 1182; and he was
compelled to raise the siege of Berytus at
the approach of the Christian troops. The
daring Rainald de Chatillon even succeeded
in his bold attempt to reconquer the harbour
of Ailah, on the Mediterranean sea. The
Latin fleet proceeded thence to the coast
of Arabia, where it threatened Mecca and
Medina, but was finally overcome near
Haura, and the knights were slain in a battle
with the Arab prophet. By this defeat
Ailah was again lost to Jerusalem. Brave
to the point of foolhardiness as was Rainald
de Chatillon in his undertakings against
Saladin, and knightly as was the spirit by
which he was moved, he failed to achieve any serious result for the
cause to which he was devoted.</p>

<p>The affairs of the opposite side now took a decisive turn. In 1181 Malik
as-Salih, prince of Aleppo and Nur ad-Din’s son, had died, leaving no kinsman
worthy to succeed him. Imad ad-Din had essayed to fill the difficult post of
ruler, but was totally incompetent, and when Saladin marched against him
in 1183 he surrendered Aleppo without a struggle, and made no attempt to
regain any of the fortresses that had already been taken from him. Saladin
made his formal entry into Aleppo in June, 1183. He was universally
accepted as the bravest and mightiest warrior that had ever fought on
the side of Islam, and religious fervour, once more risen to great height
among the Mohammedans, further aided to smooth all difficulties from his
path.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1185-1187 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In contrast to this success disaster followed disaster in the Frankish
camp. In 1185 Baldwin IV succumbed to his fatal malady, and was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
by his nephew, Baldwin V, the son of Sybilla and of William
Longaspada, who was but five years old. As if this misfortune were not
enough, Sybilla espoused in second marriage, contrary to the wishes of all
her advisers, a certain knight, Guy de Lusignan, of an ancient and noble
family of Poitou, whom no one believed capable of successfully defending
the kingdom in case of need.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/fp4.jpg" width="450" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SALADIN</p>
</div>

<p>At this juncture Raymond of Tripolis again assumed the vicegerency,
and as before held a compact with Saladin to be the only means by which he
could preserve authority over the realm. A truce
was concluded on the only terms possible&mdash;the payment
by Raymond of a certain tribute. A fresh
disturbance arose when Sybilla gave the crown,
which she had claimed for herself on the death of
Baldwin V in 1186, over to her husband, Guy de
Lusignan. This was done in direct opposition to
Raymond, who had planned to usurp the crown
himself, and endangered his newly concluded pact
with Saladin. While Guy de Lusignan, at the head
of the whole body of knighthood which had gone
unhesitatingly over to the side of the rightful heiress,
was preparing to attack Raymond at Tiberias,
the latter appealed for aid to Saladin, who sent
him a band of Turkish horsemen. It had come,
then, to this, that a master Templar was obliged to
fly to Saladin in his distress, and march out, at the
head of an army of infidels, to do battle against
his fellow Templars of Jerusalem! All bonds of
honour and tradition were severed at a single blow.
The clergy made itself particularly obnoxious at
this crisis, being incited thereto by the patriarch
Heraclius of Jerusalem. Thus, eaten up by corruption
from within and left by its natural supporters
in the West to face alone an enemy that was practically
all-powerful, the kingdom that had once
given such rich promise for the future was now tottering
helplessly to its fall.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p373.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Crossbow Man of the Second Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>Saladin, standing ready to seize the first favourable
opportunity, had some show of justice on his
side in choosing the present crisis as the most
suitable for attack, since Rainald de Chatillon, now in command of certain
citadels on the other side of the Jordan, had recently, in flagrant breach of
the truce, fallen upon and plundered a passing caravan in which was the
mother of the sultan. After in vain demanding indemnity of Rainald, Saladin
rallied all his forces for another great sacred war, and at head of countless
warriors made forcible irruption into Galilee.</p>

<p>As on many previous occasions the Christian army again assembled near
the spring of Saffuria. The grand master of the Templars had contributed
an important sum, sent him by Henry II of England, toward the preparations
for war, and Count Raymond of Tripolis was present in person. Once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
more the holy cross of Jerusalem was worshipped by the Christian army on
the eve of battle. The very first day’s operations were disastrous, however,
as the army, impelled by the knights, hurried to the relief of beleaguered
Tiberias. On the evening of July 4th, 1187, after a battle that brought victory
to neither side, Saladin’s light horse drove the Christians back to a
parched and arid eminence in the neighbourhood of Hittin, named by tradition
as the scene of Christ’s sermon on the mount. Here, at the close of a
torrid summer day, they were obliged to pass the night in the tortures of
thirst. On July 5th Saladin resumed his attack on the enfeebled, exhausted
Christians, of whom very few survived the battle that ensued. Count Raymond
escaped, thanks to the clemency of the Saracens, who opened their ranks
before him and his body of knights, as before one who had once been their
friend. King Guy and as many of his followers as had not been slain, together
with the holy cross, fell into the hands of Saladin, who this time knew no
mercy. All the captured Templars and knights of St. John were put to death,
while with his own hand the angry monarch struck down Rainald de Chatillon,
the perjured violator of the truce.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3d1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3d">d</a></span></p>

<h5>MOSLEM ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLE OF TIBERIAS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1187 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Imad ad-Din, the Moslem historian, who took part in the battle, remarks
with astonishment that as long as the Christians kept in the saddle they
were unharmed, for they were covered from head to foot with a protecting
mail woven of iron rings; but when the horse fell, the rider was lost.
“That battle,” adds the writer, “took place on a Saturday. The Christians,
like lions at the beginning of the fray, were as scattered lambs at the
end. Of many thousands, but a small number survived. The battle-field
was covered with the dead and dying. I myself walked over Mount Hittin;
it was a horrible spectacle. I saw all that a happy nation had done to a
miserable people. I saw the condition of their leader&mdash;who could describe
it? I saw severed heads; dull, dead eyes; dust-covered bodies, twisted
limbs; severed arms; crushed bones; gashed and bloody necks; broken
thighs; feet no longer joined to the leg; bodies in two pieces; torn lips
and split foreheads. On seeing their faces strewn over the ground and
covered with blood and wounds, I recalled these words of the <i>Koran</i>: “The
infidel shall say ‘What am I but dust!’ What sweet odour is exhaled from
this victory!”</p>

<p>After these reflections, which show well the Arab taste, the writer presents
another picture: “The tent ropes,” he says, “did not suffice to bind
the prisoners. I saw thirty or forty men bound by the same rope; I saw
one or two hundred of them placed together and guarded by a single man.
These warriors, who formerly exhibited extraordinary prowess and enjoyed
might and power, now with lowered brows and naked bodies were indeed a
miserable sight. Counts and Christian lords had become the prey of the
hunter, the knights that of the lion. Those who had humiliated others
were humbled in their turn; the free man was in irons. Those who
accused the truth of falsehood and treated the <i>Koran</i> as imposture had
fallen into the hands of the true believers.”</p>

<p>After the battle Saladin retired to his tent and caused King Guy and the
principal prisoners to be brought before him. It was his will that the king
be seated at his side; and as the prince was suffering from thirst he had
melted snow brought to him. The king, after drinking, offered the cup to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
Rainald, but Saladin cried: “It is not I who have asked that wretched man
to drink; I am in no way bound to him.” In fact, according to Imad
ad-Din’s statement, it was the custom with the Arabs never to kill a prisoner
to whom drink or food had been offered. Now Saladin had on two occasions
vowed to kill Rainald did the lord of Karak ever fall into his hands&mdash;the
first, when the knight planned to attack Mecca and Medina; the
second, when he captured a caravan in times of peace. The sultan turned
to Rainald and in terrible tones reproached him with these two deeds;
then rushed upon him with uplifted sword. Following his example the
emirs threw themselves upon Rainald and severed head from body. The
trunk rolled to the feet of the king, who at the sight trembled in great fear;
but Saladin hastened to reassure him and promised to respect his life.</p>

<p>Imad ad-Din relates later that what had most angered Saladin against
Rainald was that on the occasion of the above-mentioned seizure of the Moslem
caravan he called in jest to his captives to invoke Mohammed to see
whether the prophet would come to their assistance, and that before killing
him the sultan said to him: “Well, how does it seem to thee? Have
I not sufficiently avenged Mohammed for thy outrages?” Finally, adds
Imad ad-Din, he proposed to Rainald to become a Mohammedan; the latter
refused, saying that he preferred to die. Imad ad-Din relates on his own
side that when Saladin reproached Rainald with his perfidies and bad faith,
the lord replied by interpreter that such was the custom of princes and that
he in this respect had but followed the beaten path.</p>

<p>Finally the sultan had the king brought to Damascus, the captive lords
with him. With regard to the Templars and Hospitallers, Ibn al-Atir relates
that the sultan collected all he had in one place and cut off their heads.
He ordered also all those in his army who had any belonging to these
religious orders in their hands to put them to death; then judging that
the soldiers would not be sufficiently generous to make this sacrifice, he
offered fifty pieces of gold for each Templar or Hospitaller surrendered to
him. Two hundred of these warriors who were brought to him were at
once decapitated. What led the sultan to these extreme measures was that
the Templars and Hospitallers made war by profession upon Islam and were
its most cruel enemies. Thus Abul-Faraj in his <i>Syrian Chronicle</i> puts on this
occasion these words into Saladin’s mouth: “Since killing when it can be
turned to the good of their religion seems to them so sweet a thing, let
us kill them in their turn.” Saladin sent also to his lieutenant in Damascus
ordering to be put to death all the knights held in that city, whether they
were his own property or that of others; and this was done.</p>

<p>We read in Imad ad-Din, an eye-witness, that during the massacre of the
knights Saladin looked on with smiling countenance and that the victims
were sunk in hopeless despair. The Moslem army was drawn up in battle
array, the emirs in two rows. Some of the executioners performed their duty,
adds the author, with a degree of skill that brought deserved praises; some,
however, refused to act and left it to their companions. Before beheading,
a proposition was made to the prisoners to embrace Islamism but the opportunity
was taken by a very small number.</p>

<p>Such is the manner in which the Arabian chroniclers describe the battle
of Tiberias. The compiler of <i>The Two Gardens</i> gives several letters written
on that occasion. We read in one of them, sent to Baghdad, that of
the forty-five thousand men composing the Christian army scarcely one thousand
survived, and since one poor Mohammedan soldier, having taken a
prisoner, exchanged him for a pair of sandals, posterity may know that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
number of prisoners was so great that they were sold for footgear. Imad
ad-Din says in another place that all Islam rejoiced in this victory which
was but the prelude to the conquest of Jerusalem and the source of greater
triumphs.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3e1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>THE FALL OF JERUSALEM</h5>

<p>A panic terror now overspread the land, and under its resistless impulse all
hastened to place themselves in subjection to the conqueror. Even the most
strongly fortified coast towns fell one after the other; Tyre, Tripolis, and Antioch
alone upheld their independence. Askalon demanded as the price
of its surrender the release of the captive king. Jerusalem held out in
its own defence a few days longer; but what could the few knights that
remained avail against an enemy so mighty? On the 2nd of October,
1187, Saladin took formal possession of the Christian capital, to shouts of
“<i>Allah akbar!</i>” instead of the “Christ victorious!” that had been heard
in former times.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3d2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3d">d</a></span></p>

<p>Jerusalem became the refuge for such of the Christians as had escaped the
swords or the chains of the Turks. One hundred thousand people are said
to have been in the place; but so few were the soldiers, and so feeble was
the government of the queen, that the Holy City was no object of terror.
Saladin declared his unwillingness to stain with human blood a spot which
even the Turks held in reverence, as having been sanctified by the presence
of many of God’s messengers. He offered the people, on condition of the
surrender of the city, money and settlements in Syria. Prudence suggested
the acceptance of this offer, but, clinging to that feeling of superstition
which had given birth to the holy wars, the Christians declared that they
would not resign to the infidels the place where the Saviour had died.
Saladin was indignant at this rejection of his kindness, and swore to enter the
place sword in hand, and retaliate the dreadful carnage which the Franks
had made in the days of Godfrey de Bouillon. The people cast their eyes
on Balean of Ibelin as their commander. The veteran organised the forces,
and put arms into the hands of the citizens.</p>

<p>During fourteen days there were various engagements; but the Christians,
though brave to desperation, could never destroy the military engines
of the Moslems. At the end of fourteen days the Latins discovered that the
walls near the gate of St. Stephen’s were undermined. From that moment
the defence of the city was abandoned; the clergy prayed for the miraculous
protection of heaven, the soldiers threw down their arms and crowded into
the churches. The consternation was augmented by the discovery of a
correspondence between some Greeks that were in the place and the Moslems.
The Latins then recollected the proffered clemency of Saladin, and
a deputation of them implored a renewal of it. But he urged the force of
the oath which he had taken, and that it was ridiculous to capitulate for a
fallen town. “But,” said he, “if you will surrender the city to me, I will
behave to you with mercy, and allow you to redeem the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>After some deliberation, the Christians resolved to trust the generosity
of the conqueror. Saladin stipulated that the military and nobles should be
escorted to Tyre, and that the Latin population should become slaves, if
they were not ransomed at the rate of ten crowns of gold for a man, five for
a woman, and one for a child. After four days had been consumed by
the miserable inhabitants in weeping over and embracing the Holy Sepulchre
and other sacred places, the Latins left the city and passed through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
the enemy’s camp. Children of all ages clung round their mothers, and the
strength of the fathers was used in bearing away some little portion of their
household furniture. In solemn procession the clergy, the queen, and her
retinue of ladies followed. Saladin advanced to meet them, and his heart
melted with compassion, when they approached him in the attitude and
with the air of suppliants. The softened warrior uttered some words of
pity, and the women, encouraged by his sympathising tenderness, declared
that one word of his would remove their distress.</p>

<p>It is the generous remark of an enemy that Saladin was in nothing a
barbarian but in name. With courteous clemency he released all the prisoners
whom the women requested, and loaded them with presents. This
action, worthy of a gentle and Christian knight, was not the consequence of
a transient feeling of humanity; for when he entered the city of Jerusalem,
and heard of the tender care with which the military friars of St. John
treated the sick, he allowed ten of the order to remain in their hospital till
they could complete their work of humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1188-1189 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The infidels were once more established in Jerusalem. The great cross
was taken down from the church of the sepulchre, and for two days dragged
through the mire of the streets. The bells of the churches were melted, and
the floors and walls of the mosque of Omar were purified with Damascene
rose-water. Prayers and thanksgivings were offered to heaven for the victory;
all individual merit was forgotten, and the conquest of Jerusalem was
attributed to the bounty of God, and his desire for the universal influence of
Islamism. Askalon, Laodicea, Gabala, Sidon, Nazareth, Bethlehem&mdash;all
those places and their territories fell when their great support was gone, and
Tyre was almost the only town of consequence which remained to the
Christians.</p>

<p>Saladin attacked it with all his efforts, but the spirit of freedom
triumphed over the thirst of conquest, and the Moslems were necessitated
to raise the siege. Some time after the capitulation of Askalon, Guy de
Lusignan, the grand master of the Templars, and others obtained their liberty;
and the husband of Sybilla solemnly renounced to Saladin his title
to the kingdom of Jerusalem. The unprincipled Guy took the road for
Tyre, and announced his resolve to enter the city as sovereign lord.</p>

<p>After the fall of Jerusalem, Saladin carried his conquering army into the
principality of Antioch. Five and twenty towns submitted, and Antioch itself
became tributary to the Moslems. The victories of Saladin and the loss
of Jerusalem were melancholy contrasts to those hopes of the triumphs of
Christianity over Islamism which the Council of Clermont had held out to
Europe. In the eighty-eight years that the crusaders possessed the Holy
City, peace seldom dwelt about her walls; surrounded by numerous hostile
nations, she was in a continual siege, and as great a number of her wars were
undertaken for the maintenance of her existence as for the purposes of conquest.
In the time of Godfrey de Bouillon, Asia was in a state of more than
usual imbecility. The Arabian and Tatarian storms were spent, the caliphs
were pontiffs rather than sovereign princes, and the great empire of their
predecessors was dismembered and scattered.</p>

<p>But states which are formed by arms, not by policy, are as quick in their
rise as rapid in their decay, and ruin and disorder are the scenes of ambition.
The passions and abilities of the enterprising lords of Syria raised several
powerful governments; the hostile aspect of the Moslems increased in terror
when the imperial and royal crowns of Germany and France were broken;
and the crescent triumphed over the cross when Saladin united and led the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
Moslem nations to the conquest of Jerusalem. In the strength of body, and
personal and military prowess, the Turks and the Franks were equal; but the
Turks were in multitudes, the Franks were few; and as the twelfth century
was an age of war rather than of policy, the Latins did not by intellectual
superiority raise themselves above their enemies. The Christians
scrupled not to break treaties<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> with the Moslems; they never attempted
to conciliate the foe, or to live in terms of large and liberal intercourse.
Except in the case of Egypt, they allowed the Saracenian nations to unite,
without making any endeavour to break their force; and they were too proud
and too ignorant to win any members to their cause from the great confederacy
of atabegs. Conciliation could only be the result of weakness; a tender
pitying forbearance of error was held a criminal indifference by armed
saints. The Moslem contempt of infidels was not more sincere than was the
hatred which the Christians felt for the supposed enemies of God.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3c2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>FOOTNOTES</h5>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> Germany was not affected by the First Crusade in an equal degree with Lorraine, Flanders,
France, and Italy. Saxo Grammaticus says that when the Germans saw the troops of men,
women, and children, on horseback and on foot, passing through their country on their way to
Greece, they laughed at them as mad for quitting their homes to run after imaginary good in the
midst of certain dangers, renouncing their own property in search of that of other people.
Ekkehard mentions the same circumstance, and adds that the cause of the want of enthusiasm in
Germany was that the divisions between the emperor and the pope prevented the preaching of
the Crusade in that country. Signs, however, in the heavens, and other wonderful things, made
many Germans take the cross and join the armies in the course of their march.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">[51]</a> The ladies of the twelfth century did not merely thread pearls, and amuse themselves with
other employments equally delicate and elegant. The sword, and not merely the tongue,
decided their disputes. Of this practice Ordericus Vitalis, p. 687, has given a remarkable
instance. The love of “brave gestes” was the passion of the ladies as well as of the knights of
chivalry.</p>

aspired to the conquest of Egypt.”]</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> After the death of Shirkuh, several emirs of the Syrian army came forward to fill his
place: but the caliph chose Saladin and conferred on him the dignity of vizir, with the title of
<i>malik nassir</i> or general protector. According to the atabeg historian, “what induced the caliph
to choose Saladin in preference to the others, was both his youth and his weakness. He imagined
that by choosing Saladin, a man without an army and without strength, he could keep him dependent
on him and could do with him whatever he wished. He also hoped to win over one part
of the Syrian army and to drive away the other, which would restore his power to him and at
the same time put him in a position to resist Nur ad-Din and the Franks.”</p>

<p>Ibn al-Atir makes the caliph’s advisers speak in the following manner on this occasion:
“Among all the emirs of the Syrian army, there is not one weaker or younger than Joseph.
He is the one to choose. As for him, he will do what we please; we will place in the army
men devoted to our cause; we will put ourselves in a state of defence, and then we will
decide whether to seize Joseph or to banish him to Egypt.”</p>

<p>But according to the remark of the atabeg historian, “God had decided differently,” and
the caliph was to meet his ruin where he had founded his hopes. Besides, continues the same
author, Saladin at first resisted. Frightened at the high rank to which they wished to raise him,
it was necessary to persuade him by all possible means, like those beings of whom it is said that
“they must be dragged with chains to be made to enter paradise.” At last he decided to go to
the palace, and the caliph clothed him in the dress, cap, and other signs of the dignity of vizir.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_3e2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_3e">e</a></span></p>

by the valour of the military orders, and by the distant or domestic avocations of their great
enemy.”]</p>

</div>

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> It was impossible that any respect could be entertained for people like the Latins, who
were not only cruel invaders and sanguinary persecutors, but common robbers. At one time
Baldwin III gave the Moslems liberty of pasturage round Paneas. As soon as the ground was
covered with flocks of sheep, the Christian soldiers broke into the country, carried away the
animals, and murdered their keepers. The principle of not keeping faith with infidels seems
consequent on a dogma in the Decretals: “<i>Juramentum contra utilitatem ecclesiasticam præstitum
non tenet.</i>” Tancred and St. Louis were almost the only two eminent crusaders who distinguished
themselves for preferring honesty and truth to utility and convenience.</p>

<p>Europe rang with invectives against the holy Bernard, when the thousands
of men whom his eloquence and miracles had roused to arms perished
in the rocks of Cilicia. A general or a statesman would have pointed out
errors in the policy or conduct of the crusaders; but the preacher sheltered
himself under the usual defence of impostors, and declared that the sins of
the people had merited divine punishment, and that the men of his day
resembled in morals the Hebrews of old, who perished in the journey from
Egypt to the Promised Land. This language was justly felt to be cruel and
insulting; it did not exculpate the saint in the opinion of the world, and the
nations of the West were not again disposed to make religious wars the common
concern of Christendom. In the third council of the Lateran, which
met twenty years after the return to Europe of Louis and Conrad, the policy
of King Almeric had been applauded; Egypt was more dreaded than Syria,
and the possession of Damietta was held out as the object to which all the
efforts of the Christians should tend.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The clergy called on the world to
arm, but the recollection of misery was too fresh, and the decrees of the
council were heard of with sullenness and discontent. Louis, however,
always cherished the hope of returning to the Holy Land, and of reviving
his faded glory; and at length he found his wishes met by a brother sovereign.
Since virtue was his policy as well as his duty, Henry II in the
height of his disputes with Thomas à Becket had professed great sanctity;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
and following the example of the French king, he and his barons commanded
that for one year a tax of two-pence, and for four subsequent years a tax
of a penny in the pound should be levied on the movables of the people of
England. Among the deeds of virtue which washed from Henry the guilt
of Becket’s murder was the supporting of two hundred knights Templar in
Palestine for a year, and an agreement with the pope to go and fight the
infidels in Asia, or in Spain, for thrice that time if his holiness should require
it. In the year 1177, Henry and Louis agreed to travel together to the
Holy Land. But the English monarch was prudent and fond of peace,
and the illness and subsequent death of the French king terminated the
project.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1177-1188 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The count of Tripolis, while regent of Jerusalem, endeavoured to
strengthen his kingdom by new draughts of men from Europe. The importance
of the embassy which he sent to the West was apparent from
the dignity of the legates, for they were the patriarch of Jerusalem and the
grand masters of the Templars and Hospitallers.</p>

<p>While fanaticism was rekindling the torch of religious war, news arrived
in the West of the fall of Jerusalem into the hands of the infidels. The
event was felt as a calamity from one end of Europe to the other. Nothing
could exceed the terror which seized the court of Rome. In the moment
of weakness and humiliation, the cardinals acknowledged the dignity and
the force of virtue. They resolved to take no bribes in the administration
of justice, to abstain from all luxury of living and splendour of dress,
to go to Jerusalem with the scrip and staff of simple pilgrims, and never to
ride on horseback while the ground of their Saviour was trodden under the
feet of the pagans. Pope Urban III died about this period; and his death,
like every direful event of the time, was attributed to grief at the intelligence
of the Saracenian victories. William, archbishop of Tyre, our great
guide in history, was one of the messengers of the news; and his friend,
Gregory VIII, successor of Urban, not only endeavoured to deprecate the
wrath of heaven by ordaining fasting and prayer throughout Christendom,
but issued a bull for a new crusade, with the usual privileges to the
crusaders.</p>

<p>The emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, summoned a council at Mainz for
the purpose of considering the general propriety of a new crusade. Prelates
and barons were unanimous in the wish for it, and William of Tyre, and
Henry, bishop of Albano, legates of the papacy, arrived at the assembly in
time to confirm and approve its holy resolve. The emperor, and his son the
duke of Swabia, the dukes of Austria and Moravia, and sixty-eight temporal
and spiritual lords, were fired with the same enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At the solicitation of the archbishop of Tyre, Philip Augustus, king of
France, and Henry II, king of England, met at a place between Trie and
Gisors, in Normandy, February, 1188, in order to deliberate on the political
state of the times. The prelate of the eastern Latin church appeared, and
pleaded the cause of religion before the two monarchs. So pathetic was his
description of the miseries of the Latins in Syria, so touching were his reflections
on those who engaged in petty national wars, when even the stones of
the temple called on all people to avenge the cause of God, that Philip and
Henry wept, embraced, and vowed to go together to the Holy Land. They
received the cross from the hands of the archbishop. The count of Flanders
entered into their intentions. They agreed that the French crusaders should
wear red crosses, the English should be indicated by white ones, and the
Flemish by green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<h5>THE SALADIN TITHE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1188-1190 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>One opinion and one feeling influenced every breast; and, by universal
consent, a tax similar everywhere in name and in nature was imposed on
those who would not be crossed. This imposition was called the Saladin
tithe; it was to last for one year; and it extended both to movable and
unmovable property. Persons who actually assumed the cross were not
only exempted, but were even allowed to take the fiscal part of their tenants’
property. If the collectors of the tithe were dissatisfied with what a
man offered to pay, they were authorised to appoint four or six men of his
parish to make an assessment. The crusaders, too, might mortgage their
land for three years, and the mortgagee should receive the rents even to
the prejudice of former creditors. The English council forbade the pilgrims
from sensual pleasures,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> from all manner of gaming, and from the luxury of
dressing in ermine and sables. Henry wrote to the king of Hungary and
the emperor of Constantinople requesting a safe passage for his troops. The
request was granted.</p>

<p>Though ships continually sailed from England and France, bearing martial
pilgrims to the Holy Land, the ambition and restlessness of Philip
Augustus, and of Prince Richard, diverted the government and the great
body of the people from the salvation of Palestine. The ignominious peace
which England was compelled to make with France, and his mental agony
at the rebellion and ingratitude of his sons, brought on the death of the
English monarch (July, 1189). The love of military honour inflamed the
French king, and the bold, ardent, and valiant Richard Cœur de Lion had
more of the warlike spirit than of the religious feelings of the age. None of
the principles which originally caused the Crusades influenced the actions
of either.</p>

<p>So eager was Richard to equip a large military force, that he sold the
crown lands, and offices of trust and dignity were no longer to be acquired
by desert or favour. The king of Scotland obtained for ten thousand marks
Richard’s renunciation of the fortresses of Roxburgh and Berwick, and of
the claims of England on the allegiance of Scotland. Richard crossed the
channel in December, and soon after Christmas met his brother sovereign.
The monarchs renewed their protestations of perpetual friendship, and swore
that in case of necessity they would defend each others’ territories with
all the warmth of self-interest. If either of the princes should die during
the Crusade, the survivor was to use his men and money for the accomplishment
of the great design. The period of departure was deferred from
Easter to the ensuing midsummer. During his stay in Normandy, Richard
made some singular laws for regulating the conduct of the pilgrims in their
passage by sea. Murder was to be punished by casting into the water the
deceased person, with the murderer tied to him. He that drew his sword in
anger should lose his hand. If a man gave another a blow, he was to be
thrice immersed; an ounce of silver was the penalty for using opprobrious
language. A thief was to have boiling pitch and feathers put upon his head,
and was to be set on shore at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus received the staff and scrip at St. Denis, and Richard
at Tours (June, 1190). They joined their forces at Vézelay; the number
was computed at one hundred thousand soldiers, and the march to Lyons was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
conducted in union and with harmony. At that city the monarchs parted;
the lord of France pursued the Genoese road; his noble compeer that of
Marseilles, and Sicily was named as the rendezvous.</p>

<h5>BARBAROSSA’S CRUSADE AND DEATH</h5>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p382.jpg" width="150" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Crusader of the Third Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>The heroic Frederick Barbarossa was among the first of those whose grief
rose into indignation after the fall of Jerusalem. In his letters to the
sacrilegious Saladin, he demanded restitution of the city, and threatened
him in the event of non-compliance to pour into Asia all the military force
of the German states. But the triumphant
infidel replied that he would oppose his Turkomans,
his Bedouins, and Syrians to the German
hordes. Tyre, Tripolis, and Antioch, he continued,
were the only places which at that time
belonged to the Christians, and if those cities
were resigned to him, he would restore the true
cross, and permit the people of the West to
visit Jerusalem as pilgrims. Germany was indignant
at this haughty reply; all the powers
took up arms against the man who had defied
them; but in prudent remembrance of the
disorders and calamities which popular impatience
had occasioned in the First and Second
Crusades, an imperial edict was issued, that
no one should go who could not furnish his own
viaticum for a twelvemonth. The consecrated
standards of the German princes were surrounded
by innumerable hosts of crusaders,
drawn out of every class of life, from honourable
knighthood down to the meanest vassalage.
Their emperor conducted them from Ratisbon,
their rendezvous, through the friendly Hungarian
states; but when he reached the territories
of the great lord of the East, he had to
encounter the hostility of a violent yet timid foe.</p>

<p>The emperor Isaac Angelus displayed both
enmity and cowardice. He did not deny the
Germans the liberty to purchase provisions,
but in his communications with Frederick he
carefully avoided giving him imperial titles;
and the Greek governors were perplexed by
one day receiving orders to preserve the fortifications of their towns, and
at another time by commands for their destruction, lest they should become
stations of the Germans. Barbarossa marched with prudence and humanity.
In his indignation at the haughtiness and duplicity of Isaac, he generally
spared the people, and passed the Hellespont without having deigned to
enter the imperial city. He entered the territories of the Mussulmans
in triumph, and not only defeated the Turks in a general engagement, but
took Iconium. The sultan then repented of his perfidy, and with the
independent emirs of Asia Minor, deprecated the further vengeance of the
Germans. They continued their march with more honour and dignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
than had ever accompanied the early crusaders, but they were deprived by
death of their venerable hero. It was in the spring of the year that they
passed the Isaurian mountains, from which issues the small river of the
Calycadnus. In this stream Frederick bathed, but his aged frame could
not sustain the shock.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> His son, the duke of Swabia, was a brave and
experienced general, yet the death of the emperor so much revived the
courage of the Saracens, that the course of the Christians was continually
harassed. Saladin had been compelled to withdraw most of his soldiers
from Antioch, and the Germans had little difficulty in renewing a Christian
government in that city.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1190, the duke of Swabia arrived at Acre, and importance
was given to the German force by the formation of a Teutonic order
of knighthood. The Vatican confirmed the establishment; Pope Celestine
III gave it the rule of St. Augustine for its general law, and accorded to it
the privileges which distinguished the other military fraternities. The service
of the poor and sick, and the defence of the holy places, were the great
objects which the pope commanded them to regard; and their domestic
economy was to be preserved by chastity and equal participation of property.
They were divided into three classes, knights, priests, and serving brothers.
All the members were to be Germans, and those of the first class could only
be men of noble birth and extraction. The order of the Teutonic knights
of the house of St. Mary in Jerusalem was their title, and their dress was a
white mantle with a black cross, embroidered with gold.</p>

<h5>THE SIEGE OF ACRE OR PTOLEMAIS (1189-1191 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1189-1191 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>While the kings of England and France were marshalling their hosts for
a foreign war, the Christians in the Holy Land slowly recovered from their
panic, and joined Lusignan. Greeks, Latins, Syrians, Templars, and Hospitallers,
emerged from their places of secrecy, burning for revenge on the
infidel spoliators. Acre had opened its gates to the conqueror a few days
after the battle of Tiberias, and that city, by reason of its situation and
magnitude, was worthy the bravest efforts of its former lords. The sea
washed its fortifications on the north and west; a noble pier defended the
port from the storms and the enemy; and the city on the land side was fortified
by double walls, ditches, and towers.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4b1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>GEOFFREY DE VINSAUF’S ACCOUNT OF ACRE</h5>

<p>If a ten-years’ war made Troy celebrated; if the triumph of the Christians
made Antioch more illustrious, Acre will certainly obtain eternal fame,
as a city for which the whole world contended. In the form of a triangle,
it is narrow on the western side, while it extends in a wider range towards
the east, and full a third part of it is washed by the ocean on the south and
west. The port, which is not so convenient as it should be, often deceives
and proves fatal to the vessels which winter there; for the rock which lies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
over against the shore, to which it runs parallel, is too short to protect them
from the fury of the storm. And because this rock appeared a suitable
place for washing away the entrails, the ancients used it as a place for offering
up sacrifices, and on account of the flies which followed the sacrificial
flesh, the tower which stands above it was called the Tower of Flies.</p>

<p>There is also a tower called the Cursed, situated on the wall which surrounds
the city; and if we are to credit common report, it received its name
because it is said that the pieces of silver for which Judas betrayed his Lord,
were made there. The city, then named Ptolemais, was formerly situate
upon Mount Turon, which is close to the city, whence, by an error of antiquity,
some call Acre Ptolemais. There is a hill called the Mosque, near
Mount Turon, where the ancients say is the sepulchre of Memnon; but by
whose kind offices he was brought thither, we have learned neither by writing
nor by hearsay. The river which flows by the city is named Belus, and
although its bed is narrow, and not deep, Solinus has rendered it celebrated
by numbering it amongst the wonders of the world as being enriched with
glassy sand. For there was a certain sandy foss, the sand of which supplied
materials for making glass; these, if taken out, were altogether useless; but,
if let in, from the secret virtue of the place assumed a glassy nature.</p>

<p>Not far from the river is pointed out a low rock near the city, at which
it is said that the three divisions of the world, Asia, Europe, and Africa
meet; and though it contains separately the other parts of the world, the
place itself, dependent on none, is distinct from and independent of all three.
Mount Carmel rises aloft on the southern side of the city, where Elijah the
Tishbite is known to have had a habitation of modest cost, as his cave
still testifies; but although we are often wont in a description to wander away
to the pleasant parts of the circuit, we must at present overlook the attractions
of the surrounding places, while we turn our attention to the course of
the war.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4g1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4g">g</a></span></p>

<p>When Richard and Philip Augustus reached the Holy Land, the siege of
Acre had lasted twenty-two months. The most patient attention would be
exhausted by a minute detail of the operations of that period, and a liberal
curiosity will be satisfied by a notice of the chief and characteristic circumstances.</p>

<p>So perfect was the self-security of Saladin, that he did not attempt to
overwhelm the foe; and when he at length found the necessity of personally
attempting the relief of his city, the force of the king of Jerusalem was
appallingly numerous. The people of France and England could not wait
the tardy march of their organised armies; they answered with impatience the
signals of distress which Palestine hung out; indeed every country of Europe
poured forth its population with disorderly rapidity, and Lusignan was at
one time the commander of one hundred thousand soldiers. The Christians
were encamped on the plain to the south of Acre, and the general station
of Saladin was near the town and mountain of Kharuba, still further to
the south. Among the bravest of the Christian lords were the count of
Champagne, the duke of Gelderland, the landgraf of Thuringia, and James
d’Avesnes. Many of the clergy wore the casque and the cuirass; the archbishops
of Pisa and Ravenna, the bishops of Salisbury, Beauvais, Cambray,
Acre, and Bethlehem, deserved the honour of ecclesiastical knighthood; and
on one occasion the valour of Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, saved the
camp. The Christians plied the battering-rams and mangonels against
the walls, and they only ceased from their labour when Saladin called them
to battle on the plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span></p>

<p>The engagements were as sanguinary and obstinate as any which had
marked the holy wars. If the Latins at any time prevailed, they speedily
lost their advantages, by abandoning themselves to plunder, and allowing
the vigilant enemy to collect his broken battalions. When the Saracens
conquered, the Christians kept within the shelter of their fortified camp,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and did not again take the field till pressed to action by some new bands
of crusaders. The conflicts between the Moslems and Christians were by
sea as well as by land; but the naval forces were so equally balanced, that
the Latins could not finally prevent the Egyptians from succouring Acre,
and Europe kept up its communications with the camp. In the last year
of the siege the deaths by famine and pestilence exceeded the destruction
which former battles had occasioned. Both armies were wasted by a swift
decay, for the presence of such numbers had exhausted the Mussulman as
well as the Christian neighbourhood. At the siege of Acre, as well as at
the old siege of Antioch, the morals of the holy warriors were as depraved
as their condition was miserable. Yet an appearance of holiness pervaded
the camp. Religious exercises were performed, and vice was reprehended.
The crusaders were seemingly devout, but in reality were dissolute,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and
compromised for personal excesses by pharisaical scrupulosity and uncharitableness.</p>

<p>Conrad, marquis of Tyre, had joined, and afterwards left his friends,
and to his departure all the miseries of the Christians from famine were
attributed. But his own principality was his most important charge, and
he could not furnish provisions for his people and for the whole of the army
at the same time. Disease reached and destroyed princes as well as plebeians;
and when Queen Sybilla and her two young children died, Guy de Lusignan
lost his principal political support. New competitors appeared for the visionary
kingdom. Isabel, the sister of Sybilla, had been married at the early
age of eight years to Humphry lord of Thoron; but when the warm passions
of youth succeeded the indifference of infancy, the gallantry and knightly
accomplishments of Conrad, marquis of Tyre, gained her affections. In the
Middle Ages consanguinity or some canonical impediment was always discovered,
when disgust or ambition urged the dissolution of the marriage
contract; and when the will is resolved the mind is not scrupulous in its
choice of arguments of justification. The church terminated the union of
Humphry and Isabel, and the day after the proclamation of the divorce the
bishop of Beauvais married the amorous fair one to the marquis of Tyre.
As husband of the princess, Conrad claimed the honours of respect which
were due to the king of Jerusalem; Humphry was too prudent to contend
for an empty distinction, but Lusignan, who had once enjoyed the crown
would not forego the hope of recovering it. The Christian cause was
scandalised and injured by these divisions among the chiefs, but the candidates
for the pageant sceptre were obliged to submit to the general opinion
of the army, and reserve the decision of their claims for the judgment of the
French and English monarchs.</p>

<h5>RICHARD’S VOYAGE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1190-1191 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Richard’s fleet had not arrived at Marseilles at the appointed time; and
so great was his impatience that after waiting for it only eight days he hired
some galleys and put to sea. He went to Genoa, and conferred with the
French king, whose illness had kept him in that city. He then made a brief
stay at Pisa, and shortly afterwards an accident which happened to his vessel
compelled him to enter the Tiber.</p>

<p>He made some stay in Naples, and then travelled on horseback to Salerno,
where he resolved to wait till he should hear of the arrival of his navy
in the Mediterranean. The English fleet had been dispersed off Portugal by
a violent storm, but the ships finally reached Lisbon, and circumstances
enabled them to pay their obligation of gratitude. The Moors of Spain and
Africa were menacing Portugal, five hundred English soldiers joined the
king and marched to Santarem.
Their warlike aspect awed the Saracens,
and the fortunate death at this
juncture of the Moorish commander
broke the union of the enemy, and the
country was saved. The English fleet
coasted Portugal, and the southern
part of Spain, and arrived at Marseilles.
It then set sail for Messina,
and reached that place a few days before
the arrival of Philip and the French.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p386.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Knight of the Third Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>Richard left Salerno on the 13th
of September, and on the 21st reached
Mileto. He then pursued his journey,
accompanied only by one knight. He
assembled all the English ships, and
entered the harbour of Messina with
so much splendour and such clangour
of horns and trumpets that the Sicilians
and French were astonished and
alarmed. Tancred, the illegitimate
son of Roger, duke of Apulia, was at
that period the king of the island.</p>

<p>Among the precautions which Tancred took for the establishing of his
authority was the imprisonment of the widow of William the Good, his immediate
predecessor. She was the sister of Richard, king of England, but
on the arrival of that monarch in Sicily, the usurper restored her to freedom.
But her dowry was still withheld, and her brother was resolved to avenge
her wrongs. In all his measures he was violent and unjust. He placed her
in a fortress which he seized from the Sicilians, and drove out the religious
inhabitants of a monastery in order that it might contain his stores. Those
circumstances and the dissoluteness of his people were the occasion of much
altercation between the natives and the strangers. Philip Augustus had
favoured the Sicilians’ cause, and the English monarch, therefore, regarded
him as an enemy, and planted his standard on the quarters of the French.
The mediation of the barons prevented a war between Philip and Richard,
and the latter showed his goodwill to his royal companion by delivering
Messina to the soldiers of the military orders till Tancred should equitably
settle the claims of his sister. Peace was then concluded. Richard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
renounced all claims on Sicily. Messina was given to the French king,
and Richard encamped without the walls. Various regulations were made
for intercourse between the different nations during the winter months.
Merchants were not to purchase bread or corn in the army for the purpose
of re-sale, and the profits on their general transactions were restricted to
one denarius in ten. Gaming was permitted to the knights and clergy, to the
exclusion of the rest of the army. No individual, however, was to lose more
than twenty shillings in one day or night. For some time there was a frequent
interchange of good offices between the French and English. Richard
gave Philip several ships, and was so prodigal of his money among the
soldiers that it was commonly said he was more bountiful in a month than
his father had been in a year. But the disputes at Messina had rankled in
the mind of Philip, and contemporary English historians have charged him
with offering his assistance to Tancred for the expulsion of Richard.</p>

<h5>THE FRENCH SAIL TO ACRE</h5>

<p>In the month of March, 1191, Philip left Sicily and sailed to Acre. His
appearance was regarded as a divine blessing; in the moment of elation the
attacks were renewed; but orders were soon given for suspending them till
the arrival of Richard, and it is more rational to think that the improbability
of success without him was Philip’s motive, and not the specious reason that
as the cause was common, the victory should be common also. Before his
departure from Sicily, Richard avowed that he would lead a life of virtue,
and with all humility submitted his back to the scourges of his clergy. He
was detained for a short time on account of the expected arrival of his
mother Eleanor with the princess Berengaria of Navarre, to whom he had
been affianced, long before his treaty with Philip gave him liberty of marriage.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the departure of his rival, the English monarch
set sail. In the absence of numerical statements concerning the strength of
his army, we can conjecture that it was formidable from the fact that his
soldiers, horses, and stores filled two hundred ships of various sizes. A storm
dispersed his fleet, and he heard at Rhodes that two of his vessels had been
stranded on the shores of Cyprus, and that the people of the island had plundered
and imprisoned such of the crews as had survived shipwreck. The
vessel which carried the dowager queen of Sicily had been refused entrance
into port. The English therefore landed on the shores of Cyprus; the archers
as usual preceded to clear the way; their barbed arrows fell like showers of
rain on the meadows, and supported by the heavily armed soldiers they drove
the emperor and his Greeks into the interior of the island. The ruler of
Cyprus was of the race of Comnenus, but he had changed his government
into a kingdom. Isaac was taken; the king of England became lord of
Cyprus; he taxed the people to the dreadful amount of the half of their
movables, and then accorded to them the rights they had enjoyed under the
dominion of the Byzantine emperors.</p>

<p>Richard reposed himself from the toil of conquest by celebrating his marriage
with Berengaria. But in a few weeks he roused himself to arms.
His fleet left Cyprus; a large troop ship<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of Saladin crossed his way; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
light galleys surrounded and attacked her, but the lofty sides of the Turk
could not be mounted. “I will crucify all my soldiers if she should escape,”
exclaimed Richard. His men, more in dread of their sovereign’s wrath than
the swords of the foe, impelled the sharp beaks of their vessels against the
enemy; some of the soldiers dived into the sea, and seized the rudder; and
others came to close combat with the Saracens. In order to make the
capture an unprofitable one, the emir commanded his troops to cut through
the sides of their ship till the waters should rush in. They then leaped on
the decks of the English galleys. But the sanguinary and ungenerous
Richard killed or cast overboard his defenceless enemies, or, with an
avarice equally detestable, saved the commanders for the sake of their
ransom.</p>

<p>Shouts of warm and gratulatory acclamations saluted the English on
their arrival at Acre. The brilliant scene before them was calculated to
excite all the animating feelings of warriors. The martial youth of Europe
were assembled on the plain in all the pride and pomp of chivalry. The
splendid tents, the gorgeous ensigns, the glittering weapons, the armorial
cognisances, displayed the varieties of individual fancy and national peculiarities.
On the eminences in the distance the thick embattled squadrons of
the sultan were encamped. The mameluke Tatar was armed with his
bow; the people of the higher Egypt with their flails and scourges; and the
Bedouins with their spears and small round shields. The brazen drum
sounded the note of war; and the black banner of Saladin was raised in
proud defiance of the crimson standard of the cross.</p>

<h5>DISSENSION BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH KINGS</h5>

<p>The joy with which the French regarded the English was soon changed
for the bitter feelings of military envy and national hatred. The religious
objects of the war appeared to be forgotten. The Genoese and Templars
sided with Philip; and the Pisans and Hospitallers with Richard. The king
of France prepared his soldiers and their battering engines for a vigorous
and general assault on the walls of Acre; and murmured revenge when his
martial competitor declined co-operation on the ground of illness. The
choicest part of the French troops marched to the walls, eager to shame the
English.</p>

<p>But high as was the valour of the assailants, their numbers were not
adequate; and they were repulsed in every point. When Saladin, however,
attempted to carry destruction into the army and camp of his baffled foes, he
was driven back with loss. The French reappeared as assailants; but once
again displayed their imprudent spirit. In sickness and in convalescence
Richard was carried to his military engines on a mattress, and was so active
in making and using his <i>petrariæ</i>, that he soon destroyed half of one of the
Turkish towers. He preserved his machines from the Greek fire of the city;
and he rewarded his balistarii for every stone which they removed from the
walls. The ditch was filled up; the tower was completely levelled; and
the English heroes, particularly the earl of Leicester and the bishop of Salisbury,
prepared to enter the breach. The conflict was close and sanguinary.
The Pisans came to the assistance of the English, but the fury of the Turks
was irresistible and the walls were cleared of the enemy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p389.jpg" width="250" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Knight of the Third Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>The failure of the ambitious attempts of each of the monarchs at the
capture of Acre without the aid of his rival, evinced the necessity of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
co-operation.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> A reconciliation in consequence was effected between Richard
and Philip: and they determined that one should attack the walls, while the
other guarded the camp from the approaches of Saladin. But Acre had
suffered so dreadfully from a two years’ siege, that the inhabitants were
reduced to the melancholy necessity of resolving to desist from defence.
Saladin endeavoured to infuse his own invincible spirit into the minds of his
people, and revived for a moment their languid courage, by directing their
hopes to succour from Egypt. The
expected aid from Cairo did not arrive;
and the citizens wrung from
Saladin his permission for them to
capitulate. Their safety was accordingly
purchased by their agreeing to
deliver unto the two kings the city
itself, and five hundred Christian
prisoners who were in it. The true
cross was to be resigned, and one
thousand other captives, and two hundred
knights selected by the allies
from those who were in the hands of
Saladin; and unless the Mussulmans
paid to Richard and Philip the sum
of two hundred thousand pieces of
gold within forty days, the inhabitants
of Acre should be at the mercy of the
conquerors.</p>

<p>These conditions were assented to,
and, before the city changed its lords,
a proclamation was made in the French
and English camps that no one should
injure or insult such of the Turks as
quitted the place. The Christians
entered Acre; the banners of the two
kings floated on the ramparts; but
precedence seems to have been given
to Richard, for he and his wife and
sister inhabited the royal palace, while
Philip occupied the house of the Templars.
They could not refuse the justice of their soldiers’ claim, founded on
the principle that those who had shared the labours should divide the reward;
but payment was so long deferred, that many persons were forced by poverty
to sell their military equipments, and return to Europe. The kings were
divided in opinion respecting the title to the sovereignty over Palestine.
The English monarch was persuaded to espouse the cause of the weak and
miserable Lusignan. The disputes were sometimes heard of during the siege;
but after the capture they raged with violence. Negotiations however were
entered into, and the agreement reached that Lusignan should be styled king
of Jerusalem, and lord of Joppa and Askalon; yet that if Conrad should be the
survivor, he and his heirs were to have perpetual sovereignty. The English
monarch afterwards generously surrendered the isle of Cyprus to Lusignan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span></p>

<p>A few weeks after the capitulation of Acre, and before the time had
elapsed for the performance of all the conditions of the treaty, Philip
Augustus expressed his wish of returning to Europe. The duke of Burgundy,
and the largest portion of the French army, it was stipulated,
were to remain in Syria under the command of Richard. Philip Augustus
went to Tyre, gave to the marquis of that city his moiety, both of Acre and of
the Turkish prisoners, and then set sail for Europe.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4b2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>REVIEW OF THE SIEGE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1189-1191 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Such was the confusion of this famous siege, which lasted nearly three
years, and in which the crusaders shed more blood and exhibited more bravery
than ought to have sufficed for the subjugation of the whole of Asia.
More than a hundred skirmishes and nine great battles were fought before
the walls of the city; several flourishing armies came to recruit armies
nearly annihilated, and were in their turn replaced by fresh armies. The
bravest nobility of Europe perished in this siege, swept away by the sword
or disease. Among the illustrious victims of this war, history points out
Philip, count of Flanders, Guy de Chatillon, Bernard de St. Vallery, Vautrier
de Mory, Raoul de Fougères, Eudes de Gonesse, Renaud de Maguy, Geoffroi
d’Aumale, viscount de Châtellerault, Josselin de Montmorency, and
Raoul de Marle; the archbishops of Besançon and Canterbury; with many
other ecclesiastics and knights whose piety and exploits were the admiration
of Europe.</p>

<p>In this war both parties were animated by religion; each side boasted of
its miracles, its saints, and its prophets. Bishops and imams equally promised
the soldiers remission of their sins and the crown of martyrdom. Whilst
the king of Jerusalem caused the Book of the Evangelists to be borne before
him, Saladin would often pause on the field of battle to offer up a prayer or
read a chapter from the <i>Koran</i>. The Franks and the Saracens mutually accused
each other of ignorance of the true God and of outraging him by their
ceremonies. The Christians rushed upon their enemies crying, “It is the will
of God! It is the will of God!” and the Saracens answered by their war-cry,
“Islam! Islam!”</p>

<p>Fanaticism frequently augmented the fury of slaughter. The Mussulmans
from the heights of their towers insulted the religious ceremonies of
the Christians. They raised crosses on their ramparts, beat them with rods,
covered them with dust, mud, and filth, and broke them into a thousand
pieces before the eyes of the besiegers. At this spectacle the Christians
swore to avenge their outraged worship, and menaced the Saracens with the
destruction of every Mohammedan pulpit. In the heat of this religious animosity,
the Mussulmans often massacred disarmed captives; and in more than
one battle they burned their Christian prisoners in the very field of conflict.
The crusaders but too closely imitated the barbarity of their enemies; funeral
piles lighted up by fanatical rage were often extinguished in rivers of
blood.</p>

<p>The Mussulman and Christian warriors provoked each other during single
combats, and were as lavish of abuse as the heroes of Homer. Heroines
often appeared in the mêlée, and disputed the prize of strength and courage
with the bravest of the Saracens. Children came from the city to fight with
the children of the Christians in the presence of the two armies. But sometimes
the furies of war gave place to the amenities of peace, and Franks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
and Saracens would for a moment forget the hatred that had led them to take
up arms. During the course of the siege several tournaments were held in
the plain of Acre, to which the Mussulmans were invited. The champions
of the two parties harangued each other before entering the lists; the conqueror
was borne in triumph, and the conquered ransomed like a prisoner of
war. In these warlike festivities, which brought the two nations together,
the Franks often danced to the sound of Arabian instruments, and their
minstrels afterwards played or sang to the dancing of the Saracens.</p>

<p>Most of the Mussulman emirs, after the example of Saladin, affected an
austere simplicity in their vestments and manners. An Arabian author
compares the sultan, in his court, surrounded by his sons and brothers, to
the star of night which sheds a sombre light amidst the other stars. The
principal leaders of the crusade did not entertain the same love of simplicity,
but endeavoured to excel each other in splendour and magnificence. As in
the First Crusade, the princes and barons were followed into Asia by their
hunting and fishing appointments, and the luxuries of their palaces and
castles. When Philip Augustus arrived before Acre, all eyes were for a
moment turned upon the falcons he had brought with him. One of these
having escaped from the hands of his keeper, perched upon the ramparts of
the city, and the whole Christian army was excited by endeavours to recapture
the fugitive bird. As it was caught by the Mussulmans, and carried to
Saladin, Philip sent an ambassador to the sultan to recover it, offering a sum
of gold that would have been quite sufficient for the ransom of many Christian
warriors.</p>

<p>The misery which so often visited the crusaders, did not at all prevent a
great number of them from indulging in excesses of license and debauchery.
All the vices of Europe and Asia were met together on one spot. If an
Arabian author may be believed, at the very moment in which the Franks
were a prey to famine and contagious diseases, a troop of three hundred
women from Cyprus and the neighbouring islands arrived in the camp.
These three hundred women, whose presence in the Christian army was a
scandal in the eyes of the Saracens, prostituted themselves among the soldiers
of the cross, and stood in no need of employing the enchantments of
the Armida of Tasso to corrupt them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the clergy were unremitting in their exhortations to the pilgrims
to lead them back to the morals of the Gospel. Churches, surmounted
by wooden steeples, were erected in the camp, in which the faithful were
every day called together. Not unfrequently the Saracens took advantage
of the moment at which the soldiers left their entrenchments unguarded to
attend mass, and made flying but annoying incursions. Amidst general corruption,
the siege of Acre presented many subjects of edification. In the
camp, or in the field of battle, charity hovered constantly around the Christian
soldier, to soothe his misery, to watch his sick pallet, or dress his wounds.
During the siege the warriors from the north were in the greatest distress,
and could gain little assistance from other nations. Some pilgrims from
Lübeck and Bremen came to their aid, formed tents of the sails of their vessels
to shelter their poor countrymen, and ministered to their wants and
tended their diseases. Forty German nobles took part in this generous
enterprise, and their association was the origin of the hospitable and military
order of the Teutonic knights.</p>

<p>When the crusaders entered Acre, they shared the sovereignty of it
amongst them, each nation taking possession of one of the quarters of the
city, which had soon as many masters as it had had enemies. The king of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
Jerusalem was the only leader that obtained nothing in the division of the
first reconquered place of his kingdom.</p>

<p>The capitulation remained unexecuted; Saladin, under various pretexts,
deferring the completion of the conditions. Richard, irritated by a delay
which appeared to him a breach of faith, revenged himself upon the
prisoners that were in his hands. Without pity for disarmed enemies, or
for the Christians he exposed to sanguinary reprisals, he massacred five
thousand Mussulmans before the city they had so valiantly defended, and
within sight of Saladin, who shared the disgrace of this barbarity by thus
abandoning his bravest and most faithful warriors.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>This action, which excited the regret of the whole Christian army, sufficiently
exposed the character of Richard, and showed what was to be dreaded
from his violence; a barbarous and implacable enemy could not become
a generous rival. On the day of the surrender of Acre, he committed a
gross outrage upon Leopold, duke of Austria, by ordering the standard of
that prince, which had been planted on one of the towers, to be cast into the
ditch. Leopold dissembled his resentment, but swore to avenge this insult
whenever he should find an opportunity.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4c1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>THE CRUSADERS MOVE ON JERUSALEM</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1191-1192 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It was with difficulty that the soldiers would leave the pleasures of Acre.
A historian tells us that the wine in the city had already changed the complexion
of the gravest Christian knights, and, for the preservation of discipline,
women were prohibited from marching with the army. The largesses of
Richard to the duke of Austria, the count of Champagne, and others, kept
them from following Philip to Europe, and Plantagenet was at the head
of nearly thirty thousand French, German, and English soldiers. These holy
warriors left Acre and marched in a southerly direction, generally within
sight of their ships, which coasted along the shores, bearing forage and provisions,
and military necessaries. Clouds of Turks overhung and burst on
the advancing army; the Red Cross knights in the van, and the military
friars in the rear, frequently broke the violence of the storm; but the safety
of the crusaders was principally owing to the indissoluble firmness of their
columns, and their resolute forbearance.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Near Azotus a general engagement could no longer be avoided by Richard.
The right of his line was commanded by that heroic and hardy champion
of the cross, James d’Avesnes. The duke of Burgundy, a man of doubtful
virtue, headed the left; and Plantagenet himself was the stay and bulwark
of the centre. The hosts of Syria and Egypt, led by Saladin, made a general
and impetuous charge on their foe. The right wing of the Christians was
repulsed; the left drove back the Saracens, but it was drawn by the enemy
far from the other divisions of the army. Richard hastened with a select<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
band to the aid of the duke of Burgundy, and Saladin, in his endeavour to
strengthen his right wing, removed the weight of hostility from James
d’Avesnes. No deep impression had been made on the English lines. The
personal bravery of Richard achieved wonders; his countenance, his gestures,
his invocations to St. George, seconded the ardour of his troops, and the
Turks were driven back with great slaughter to Azotus. The loss of the
Christians, though not numerous, was severe, for James d’Avesnes perished,
and his death was justly regretted
by the king as the loss of a great
pillar of the Christian cause.</p>

<p>The progress of Cœur de Lion
was no longer molested, and he
quickly arrived at Joppa. That
city was now without fortifications,
for when the tide of victory
turned from the Mussulmans at
Azotus, Saladin commanded the
dismantling of all his fortresses
in Palestine. It was policy to
keep his enemies perpetually in
the field, and to exhaust them by
ceaseless skirmishes and engagements.
As the road to Askalon
was open, Richard wished to press
his advantages; but the spirit of
faction renewed its baneful influence,
and the French barons insisted
on the necessity of restoring
the works of Joppa. Their opinion
was in unfortunate accordance
with the inclinations of an army
already attenuated by incessant
marching, and who thought with
regret on the pleasures which had
been for a while familiarised and
endeared to them at Acre. It was
resolved, therefore, that Joppa
should be re-fortified. Plantagenet,
alive to every duty of a
general, urged the completion of
the works. The soldiers, however,
gradually sunk into that
state of luxury and idleness, from
which they had been with such
difficulty recovered by Richard.
The Mussulmans roused themselves
from the distress and panic of their late defeat at Azotus; they began
to collect in the vicinity of Joppa, and their military appearance awoke
the English and French from their disgraceful sleep of licentiousness.</p>

<p>Vinsauf<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4g2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4g">g</a></span> tells how Richard, as ardent in pleasure as in war, enjoyed the
amusement of falconry, heedless of the enemy. On one occasion the royal
party would have paid dearly for their temerity, if a Provençal gentleman,
named William de Pratelles, had not cried aloud, “I am the king”; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
by this noble lie the attention of the Saracens was drawn upon himself,
while the real sovereign escaped. Shortly afterwards a body of Templars
fell into an ambuscade of the Turks. Richard sent the earl of Leicester to the
aid of the brave but exhausted knights, and promised to follow straight.
Before he could buckle on his coat of steel, he heard that the enemy had
triumphed. Despising all personal solicitude, and generously declaring he
should not deserve the name of king if he abandoned those whom he had
vowed to succour, he flew to the place of combat, plunged into the thickest
of the fight, and his impetuosity received its usual reward of success.</p>

<p>The fortifications of Joppa were at length restored, a vigorous renewal
of the war was determined on, and Plantagenet declared to the Saracens that
the only way of averting his wrath would be to surrender to him the kingdom
of Jerusalem, as it existed in the reign of Baldwin the leper. Saladin
did not reject this proposal with disdain, but made a modification of the
terms, in offering to yield Palestine from the Jordan to the sea. The negotiation
lasted for some time. Richard was deceived and cajoled by the presents
and blandishments of Saphedin [Saif ad-Din], who was the brother of
Saladin, and the Christians were ashamed that their leader should be so
friendly with an infidel. The barons soon saw, and compelled their royal
lord to see, the artifice of the Turks, who resumed their attacks, and the
negotiation was broken off. But the Templars, Hospitallers, and Pisans,
dissuaded the king from attacking Jerusalem, on the argument that even if
it should be taken they would immediately have to fight with the Turks
in the neighbourhood. Richard commanded a retreat, and the army fell back
upon Ramula, and then continued its retrogression to Askalon, a city of high
consequence in the judgment of the Latins, because it was the link between
the Turks in Jerusalem and the Turks in Egypt.</p>

<p>Until the return of the spring, all commerce between Askalon and other
countries was cut off, and the army endured therefore the hardships of
famine in addition to the usual severities of the climate. The impatient
duke of Burgundy deserted the standard of Richard; some of the French
soldiers went to Acre and Joppa; and others found a welcome reception at
the court of the marquis of Tyre. But discontent gave place for a while to
better feelings; and, at the solicitation of Plantagenet, most of the deserters
returned to their duty. But Conrad disdained an answer to the royal summons.
The walls of Askalon were soon repaired, for the proudest nobles
and the most dignified clergy worked like the meanest of the people. The
duke of Austria was the only distinguished man who was wrapped in haughty
selfishness, and who could say that he was neither a carpenter nor a mason.
Before indeed the works were completed, Richard lost the aid of his French
allies, who, more mercenary than chivalric, retired to Acre, because the royal
coffers were exhausted, and the king could not give them their stipulated
pay. Commercial jealousy, as well as military envy, obstructed the Crusades.
The Genoese and Pisans made Acre the theatre of their animosities;
and an appearance of dignity and disinterestedness was given to their feuds,
when they fought in the name and for the interests of their respective
friends, Conrad and Guy. The marquis of Tyre joined his troops to the
Genoese, and the civil war would have spread through all the Christian
powers, if Plantagenet had not marched from Askalon to Acre. Conrad
prudently retraced his steps, and by the address of the English king the
breach between the republicans was closed. Richard endeavoured to conciliate
the marquis; but the young nobleman aspired to independence and sovereign
power, drew seven hundred French soldiers from Askalon to Tyre, and allied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
himself with Saladin. When Richard had retired from Jerusalem, and his
army became broken, Saladin had dismissed many of his troops to their
families and homes; but when he heard of the defection of Conrad, he
thought that the moment of active hostility was arrived, and he accordingly
spread his standard, and summoned his hosts.</p>

<p class="caption">ARMY OF RICHARD IN THE EAST</p>
</div>

<p>Richard was cool and undismayed at the military port of his enemy, but
political disturbances in England demanded the presence of the monarch,
and he was compelled to yield to his necessities, and solicit his generous foe
to terminate the war. He declared that he required only the possession of
the sacred city, and of the true cross. But the Mussulman replied that
Jerusalem was as dear to the Moslem as to the Christian world, and that he
would never be guilty of conniving at idolatry by permitting the worship of
a piece of wood. Thwarted by the religious principles of his enemies,
Richard endeavoured to win upon their softer affections. He proposed a
consolidation of the Christian and Mohammedan interests, the establishment
of a government at Jerusalem, partly European and partly Asiatic; and
these schemes of policy were to be carried into effect by the marriage of
Saphedin with the widow of William king of Sicily. The Mussulman
princes would have acceded to these terms; but the marriage was thought
to be so scandalous to religion, that the imams and the priests raised a storm
of clamour, and Richard and Saladin, powerful as they were, submitted to
popular opinion.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The necessity of Richard’s return to England grew stronger, and the
only cause of his delay was the choice of a military commander of the Christians.
The imbecile Guy had but few partisans, and the public voice was
in favour of the valiant Conrad; Richard generously overlooked the circumstance,
that the prince of Tyre was his enemy, and the friend of Saladin, and
consented to the public wish. But while preparations were making for the
coronation, Conrad was slain by two of the Assassins. In the first moments
of indignation, the French declared that Richard had instigated the murderers.
They demanded from the widow of Conrad the resignation of Tyre,
but she was too politic to encounter the anger of the king. Count Henry
of Champagne appeared in the midst of the tumult; he took the throne
upon the invitation of the people, and following the approved precedent, he
secured himself from opposition by marrying the widow of Conrad. Richard
confirmed the election of the people, and the civil war was closed. The duke
of Burgundy and the count of Champagne joined Richard.</p>

<p>Disregarding the calls from England, the king led his English and Normans
to the fortress of Darum, reduced it, and gave it to the French, whose
preparations for the attack had been rendered needless by the superior activity
of their allies. Some new messengers from England brought fresh accounts of
the increasing power of Prince John, and the treachery of Philip Augustus.
The army continued its march towards Jerusalem, and encamped in the valley
of Hebron. The generals and soldiers vowed that they would not quit Palestine
without having redeemed the sepulchre. Everything wore the face of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
joy when this resolution was adopted; Richard participated in the feeling,
and although he thought that his presence in England would be the only
means of restoring affairs there, yet he professed to the duke of Burgundy,
and the count of Champagne, that no solicitation from Europe should prevail
with him to leave the allies until after the following Easter. Hymns and
thanksgivings testified the popular joy at this resolution.</p>

<p>The nearer the approach of the Christians the greater was the terror of the
Mussulmans in Jerusalem; many of them prepared to leave the city, and even
Saladin was alarmed for its safety. The crusaders were at Bethlehem; the
French nobility in the council were as clamorous as the people without to
press forward; but the mind of Richard vacillated, and he avowed his doubts
of the policy of the measure, as his force was not adequate to a siege, and to
the keeping up of communications with its stores on the coast. He proposed
that they should march to Berytus, to Cairo, or Damascus; but as the barons
of Syria, the Templars, and Hospitallers, had a perfect knowledge of Palestine,
he thought that their decision should regulate the proceedings of the army.</p>

<h5>THE ENTERPRISE ABANDONED</h5>

<p>A council of twenty was accordingly appointed from the military orders,
the lords of the Holy Land, and also the French knights. They learned
that the Turks had destroyed all the cisterns, which were within two miles
of the city; they felt that the heats of summer had begun; and for these
reasons it was decided that the siege of Jerusalem should be deferred, and that
the army should march to some other conquest. As a general, Richard was
fully aware of the impolicy of advancing against the sacred city, yet he
was unable to suppress his bitter feelings of mortification at a decision which
would probably blast the proud hopes that he had indulged of redeeming
the sepulchre. A friend led him to a hill which commanded a view of Jerusalem;
but, covering his face with a shield, he declared that he was not
worthy to behold a city which he could not conquer. The French soldiers
uttered invectives and complaints against the decision of the council; Cœur
de Lion offered them provisions, ships, and money, if they would obey its
decree, and march to Cairo; and although they acquiesced, yet as they were
not zealous, Richard remained in inactivity and indecision.</p>

<p>Active hostility against the Saracens was abandoned by the Christians for
the fiercer employment of civil rancour and dissensions; and if a retreat had
not been commanded, the army would have been totally destroyed by Saladin.
Richard could preserve but little order and discipline among the soldiers.
Some retired to Joppa, but Acre was the rendezvous of most of the army.</p>

<p>By the quickest marches Saladin reached Joppa, and so vigorous was his
siege of it that in a few days one of the gates was broken down, and such of
the people as could not defend themselves in the great tower, or escape by
sea, were destroyed. Before the morning, however, the brave Plantagenet
reached Joppa. Abandoning the hope of rescuing the Holy Land from
infidel subjection, he was on the point of quitting Acre and of returning to
Europe, when the precipitancy of his Moslem rival opened again all his
visions of glory and conquest. The French refused to march; but the
Templars and Hospitallers, the Pisans and Genoese, the earl of Leicester and
the other English nobles, vowed to save their friends. Richard and some of
his troops went by sea to Joppa; other soldiers took the land course, but
were badly distressed by those impediments which Saladin, in anticipation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
of their approach, cast in their way. Plantagenet was the first who leaped
on shore, and the most active with his deadly sword.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4b3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<p>There have been few feats of arms more renowned than this all-day fight
of Richard, and the old chronicler, Geoffrey de Vinsauf, has written of it in
such strain of enthusiasm that we cannot forbear quoting the splendid pictures,
whose hyperbole is its own explanation and excuse.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>VINSAUF’S ACCOUNT OF RICHARD AT JOPPA</h5>

<p>The king hearing of the danger to which the besieged were exposed and
pitying their condition interrupted the messengers.</p>

<p>“As God lives,” said he, “I will be with them, and give them all the
assistance in my power!” The words were hardly out of his mouth, before
a proclamation was made that the army should be got ready. But the
French would not vouchsafe even to honour the king with an answer,
exclaiming proudly that they should never again march under his command;
and in this they were not disappointed, for they never again marched under
anybody’s command, for in a short time they all miserably perished. Meanwhile,
however, the soldiers of all nations, whose hearts God had touched,
and the sufferings of their fellow-creatures excited to compassion, hastened
to set out with the king; namely, the Templars, the Hospitallers, and several
other valiant knights, all of whom marched by land to Cæsarea; but the
noble king trusting for his safety to his own valour, embarked on board his
fleet of galleys, which were equipped with everything that could be necessary.
A contrary wind arose, which detained the king’s ships three days at
Caiphas, where they had put in.</p>

<p>The king, vexed at this delay, exclaimed aloud, “O Lord God, why dost
thou detain us here? consider, I pray thee, the urgency of the case, and the
devoutness of our wishes.” No sooner had he prayed thus than God caused
a favourable wind to spring up, which wafted his fleet before it into the
harbour of Joppa, in the midst of the night of Friday immediately preceding
the Saturday on which they had agreed to surrender, and all of them
would have been given over to destruction. They fled up the fortress as
far as they were able, and there awaited the stroke of martyrdom, shedding
tears, and supplicating the mercy of the Almighty who at length was appeased,
and deigned to listen to their petition; their deliverer was already
come, his fleet was riding in the harbour, and his soldiers were eager to
land for their rescue!</p>

<p>The Turks, discovering the arrival of the king’s fleet, sallied down to the
seaside with sword and shield, and sent forth showers of arrows: the shore
was so thronged with their multitude that there was hardly a foot of ground
to spare. Neither did they confine themselves to acting on the defensive,
for they shot their arrows at the crews of the ships, and the cavalry spurred
their horses into the sea to prevent the king’s men from landing. The king,
gathering his ships together, consulted with his officers what was the best
step to take.</p>

<p>“Shall we,” said he, “push on against this rabble multitude who occupy
the shore, or shall we value our lives more than the lives of those poor
fellows who are exposed to destruction for want of our assistance?” Some
of them replied that further attempts were useless, for it was by no means
certain that anyone remained alive to be saved, and how could they land
in the face of so large a multitude?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span></p>

<p>The king looked around thoughtfully, and at that moment saw a priest
plunge into the water and swim toward the royal galley. When he was
received on board, he addressed the king with palpitating heart and spirits
almost failing him. “Most noble king, the remnant of our people, waiting
for your arrival, are exposed like sheep to be slain, unless the divine grace
shall bring you to their rescue.” “Are any of them still alive, then?”
asked the king, “and if so, where are they?” “There are still some of
them alive,” said the priest, “and hemmed in and at the last extremity in
front of yonder tower.” “Please God, then,” replied the king, “by whose
guidance we have come, we will die with our brave brothers in arms, and a
curse light on him who hesitates.”</p>

<p>The word was forthwith given, the galleys were pushed to land; the
king dashed forward into the waves with his thighs unprotected by armour,
and up to his middle in the water; he soon gained firm footing on the dry
strand; behind him followed Geoffrey du Bois and Peter de Pratelles, and
in the rear came all the others rushing through the waves. The Turks
stood to defend the shore, which was covered with their numerous troops.
The king, with an arbalest which he held in his hand, drove them back
right and left; his companions pressed upon the recoiling enemy, whose
courage quailed when they saw it was the king, and they no longer dared
to meet him. The king brandished his fierce sword, which allowed them no
time to resist, but they yielded before his fiery blows and were driven in
confusion with blood and havoc by the king’s men until the shore was
entirely cleared of them.</p>

<p>The king then, by a winding stair, which he had remarked in the house
of the Templars, was the first to enter the town, where he found more than
three thousand of the Turks turning over everything in the houses, and
carrying away the spoil. The brave king had no sooner entered the town
than he caused his banners to be hoisted on an eminence, that they might
be seen by the Christians in the tower, who, taking courage at the sight,
rushed forth in arms from the tower to meet the king, and at the report
thereof the Turks were thrown into confusion. The king, meanwhile, with
brandished sword, still pursued and slaughtered the enemy, who were thus
enclosed between the two bodies of the Christians, and filled the streets with
their slain. All were slain, except such as took to flight in time; and thus
those who had before been victorious were now defeated and received condign
punishment, whilst the king still continued the pursuit, showing no
mercy to the enemies of Christ’s cross, whom God had given into his hands;
for there never was a man on earth who so abominated cowardice as he.</p>

<p>But the king had only three horses with him, and what were three
among so many? If we examine the deeds of the ancients, and all the
records left us by former historians, we shall find that there never was a
man who so distinguished himself in battle as King Richard did this day.
When the Turks leaving the town saw his banners floating in the air, a cry
was raised on right and left as he sallied forth upon them, and no hail-storm
or tempest ever so densely concealed the sky, as it was then darkened by
the flying arrows of the Turks. Saladin, hearing of the king’s arrival, and
of his brilliant contest with the Turks, of whom he had slain all who opposed
him, was seized with sudden fear, and like that timid animal, the hare, put
spurs to his horse and fled from before his face. The king, with his men, still
continued the pursuit, slaying and destroying, whilst his arbalesters made
such havoc of the horses that for two miles the traces of their flight were
visible. He now therefore pitched his tent in the same place where those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
of Saladin had been, and thus by the divine grace so small a body of men had
defeated this large army of the Turks. It was then given out among the Turks
what a reproach it was to them, and lasting scandal, that so large an army and
so many thousands of the Turks had been defeated by so small an army,
and that Joppa had been recovered from them by force of arms. In this
manner they murmured to one another at what had taken place, and trembled
with confusion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a certain depraved set of men among the Saracens, called
Menelones of Aleppo and Cordivi, an active race, met together to consult
what should be done in the existing state of things. They spoke of the
scandal which lay against them, that so small an army, without horses, had
driven them out of Joppa, and they reproached themselves with cowardice
and shameful laziness, and arrogantly made a compact among themselves
that they would seize King Richard in his tent, and bring him before Saladin,
from whom they would receive a most munificent reward. But now, by the
providence of God, who had decreed that his holy champion should not be
seized whilst asleep by the infidels, a certain Genoese was led by the divine
impulse to go out early in the morning into the fields, where he was alarmed
at the noise of men and horses advancing, and returned speedily, but just
had time to see helmets reflecting back the light which now fell upon them.
He immediately rushed with speed into the camp, calling out “To arms! to
arms!” The king was awakened by the noise, and leaping startled from
his bed, put on his impenetrable coat of mail, and summoned his men to the
rescue.</p>

<p>God of all virtues! lives there a man who would not be shaken by such a
sudden alarm? The enemy rushed unawares, armed against unarmed, many
against few, for our men had no time to arm, or even to dress themselves.
The king himself therefore, and many others with him, on the urgency of
the moment, proceeded without their cuishes to the fight, some even without
their breeches, and they armed themselves in the best manner they could,
though they were going to fight the whole day. Whilst our men were thus
arming in haste, the Turks drew near, and the king mounted his horse with
only ten other knights. These alone had horses, and some even of those
they had were base and impotent horses unused to arms; the common men
were skilfully drawn out in ranks and troops, with each a captain to command
them. Oh, who could fully relate the terrible attacks of the infidels?
The Turks at first rushed on with horrid yells, hurling their javelins and shooting
their arrows. The king ran along the ranks and exhorted every man to
be firm and not to flinch. The Turks came on like a whirlwind, again and
again, making the appearance of an attack, that our men might be induced
to give way, and when they were close up, they turned their horses off in
another direction. The king and his knights, who were on horseback, perceiving
this, put spurs to their horses and charged into the middle of the
enemy, upsetting them right and left, and piercing a large number through
the body with their lances; at last they pulled up their horses, because they
found that they had penetrated entirely through the Turkish lines.</p>

<p>The king now looking about him, saw the noble earl of Leicester fallen
from his horse, and fighting bravely on foot. No sooner did he see this than
he rushed to his rescue, snatched him out of the hands of the enemy, and
replaced him on his horse. What a terrible combat was then waged! A
multitude of Turks advanced, and used every exertion to destroy our small
army; vexed at our success, they rushed towards the royal standard of a
lion, for they would rather have slain the king than a thousand others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
In the midst of the mêlée the king saw Ralph de Mauleon dragged off prisoner
by the Turks, and spurring his horse to speed, in a moment released him
from their hands, and restored him to the army; for the king was a very
giant in the battle, and was everywhere in the field&mdash;now here, now there,
wherever the attacks of the Turks raged the hottest. So bravely did he
fight, that there was no one, however gallant, that would not readily and
deservedly yield to him the pre-eminence.</p>

<p>On that day he performed the most gallant deeds on the furious army of
the Turks, and slew numbers with his sword, which shone like lightning;
some of them were cloven in two from their helmet to their teeth, whilst
others lost their heads, arms, and other members, which were lopped off at a
single blow. While the king was thus labouring with incredible exertions
in the fight, a Turk advanced towards him, mounted on a foaming steed.
He had been sent by Saphedin of Archadia, brother to Saladin, a liberal and
munificent man, if he had not rejected the Christian faith. This man now
sent to the king, as a token of his well-known honourable character, two
noble horses, requesting him earnestly to accept them, and make use of
them, and if he returned safe and sound out of that battle, to remember the
gift and recompense it in any manner he pleased. The king readily received
the present, and afterwards nobly recompensed the giver. Such is bravery,
cognisable even in an enemy; since a Turk, who was our bitter foe, thus
honoured the king for his distinguished valour.</p>

<p>The king, especially at such a moment of need, protested that he would
have taken any number of horses equally good from anyone, even more a foe
than Saphedin, so necessary were they to him at that moment. Fierce now
raged the fight, when such numbers attacked so few; the whole earth was
covered with the javelins and arrows of the unbelievers; they threw them
several at a time against our men, of whom many were wounded. Thus the
weight of the battle fell heavier upon us than before, and the galley-men
withdrew in the galleys which brought them, and so, in their anxiety to be
safe, they sacrificed their character for bravery. Meanwhile a shout was
raised by the Turks, as they strove who should first occupy the town, hoping
to slay those of our men whom they should find within.</p>

<p>The king, hearing the clamour, taking with him only two knights and
two cross-bow men, met three Turks, nobly caparisoned, in one of the principal
streets. Rushing bravely upon them, he slew the riders in his own royal
fashion, and made booty of two horses. The rest of the Turks who were
found in the town were put to the rout in spite of their resistance, and dispersing
in different directions, sought to make their escape even where there
was no regular road. The king also commanded the parts of the walls
which were broken down to be made good, and placed sentinels to keep
watch lest the town should be again attacked. These matters settled, the
king went down to the shore, where many of our men had taken refuge on
board the galleys. These the king exhorted by the most cogent arguments
to return to the battle and share with the rest whatever might befall them.
Leaving five men as guards on board each galley, the king led back the rest
to assist his hard-pressed army; and he no sooner arrived, than with all his
fury he fell upon the thickest ranks of the enemy, driving them back and
routing them, so that even those who were at a distance and untouched
by him, were overwhelmed by the throng of the troops as they retreated.</p>

<p>Never was there such an attack made by an individual. He pierced
into the middle of the hostile army, and performed the deeds of a brave and
distinguished warrior. The Turks at once closed upon him and tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
overwhelm him. In the meantime our men, losing sight of the king, were
fearful lest he should have been slain, and when one of them proposed that
they should advance to find him, our lines could hardly contain themselves.
But if by any chance the disposition of our troops had been broken, without
doubt they would all have been destroyed. What however was to be
thought of the king who was hemmed in by the enemy, a single man
opposed to so many thousands?</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Saracen Chief</span></p>
</div>

<p>The hand of the writer faints to tell it, and the mind of the reader to
hear it. Who ever heard of such a man? His bravery was ever of the
highest order, no adverse storm could sink it; his valour was ever blooming.
Why then do we speak of the valour of Antæus, who regained his
strength every time he touched his mother
earth, for Antæus perished when he was
lifted up from earth in the long wrestling
match. The body of Achilles also, who
slew Hector, was invulnerable, because
he was dipped in the Stygian waves;
yet Achilles was mortally wounded in
the very part by which he was held when
they dipped him. Likewise Alexander,
the Macedonian, who was stimulated by
ambition to subjugate the whole world,
undertook a most difficult enterprise, and
with a handful of choice soldiers fought
many celebrated battles, but the chief
part of his valour consisted in the excellence
of his soldiers. In the same
manner, the brave Judas Maccabæus, of
whose wars all the world discoursed, performed
many wonderful deeds worthy
forever to be remembered, but when he
was abandoned by his soldiers in the
midst of a battle, with thousands of
enemies to oppose him, he was slain, together
with his brothers.</p>

<p>But King Richard, inured to battle
from his tenderest years, and to whom
even famous Roland could not be considered
equal, remained invincible even
in the midst of the enemy, and his body,
as if it were made of brass, was impenetrable
to any kind of weapon. In his right hand he brandished his sword,
which in its rapid descent broke the ranks on either side of him. Such was
his energy amid that host of Turks that, fearing nothing, he destroyed all
around him, mowing men down with his sword as reapers mow down the corn
with their sickles. Who could describe his deeds? Whoever felt one of his
blows, had no need of a second. Such was the energy of his courage, that it
seemed to rejoice at having found an occasion to display itself. The sword
wielded by his powerful hand, cut down men and horses alike, cleaving
them to the middle.</p>

<p>The Turks were terror-struck at the sight, and giving way on all sides,
scarcely dared to shoot at him from a distance with their arrows. The king
now returned safe and unhurt to his friends, and encouraged them more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
than ever with the hope of victory. How were their minds raised from
despair when they saw him coming safe out of the enemy’s ranks! They
knew not what had happened to him, but they knew that without him all
the hopes of the Christian army would be in vain. The king’s person was
stuck all over with javelins, like a deer pierced by the hunters, and the
trappings of his horse were thickly covered with arrows. Thus, like a
brave soldier, he returned from the contest, and a bitter contest it was, for
it had lasted from the morning sun to the setting sun. It may seem indeed
wonderful and even incredible that so small a body of men endured so long
a conflict; but by God’s mercy we cannot doubt the truth of it, for in that
battle only one or two of our men were slain. But the number of the
Turkish horses which lay dead on the fields is said to have exceeded fifteen
hundred; and of the Turks themselves more than seven hundred were
killed, and yet they did not carry back King Richard, as they had boasted,
as a present to Saladin; but, on the contrary, he and his brave followers
performed so many deeds of valour in the sight of the Turks, that the
enemy themselves shuddered to behold them. In the meantime, our men
having by God’s grace escaped destruction, the Turkish army returned to
Saladin, who is said to have ridiculed them by asking where Melek Richard
was, for they had promised to bring him a prisoner? “Which of you,”
continued he, “first seized him, and where is he? Why is he not produced?”
To whom one of the Turks that came from the farthest countries
of the earth replied; “In truth, my lord, Melek Richard, about whom
you ask, is not here; we have never heard since the beginning of the world
that there ever was such a knight so brave and so experienced in arms.
In every deed at arms, he is ever the foremost; in deeds, he is without a
rival, the first to advance and the last to retreat; we did our best to seize
him, but in vain, for no one can escape from his sword; his attack is dreadful;
to engage with him is fatal, and his deeds are beyond human nature.”</p>

<p>From the toil and exertion of the battle, King Richard and several
others who had exerted themselves the most, fell ill, not only from the
fatigue of the battle, but the smell of the corpses, which so corrupted the
neighbourhood, that they all nearly died.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4g3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4g">g</a></span></p>

<h5>PEACE BETWEEN THE KINGS</h5>

<p>Richard now wished for peace, and Saladin, exhausted by wars, submitted
to necessity. They exchanged expressions of esteem, and as the former
avowed his contempt of the vulgar obligation of oaths, they only grasped
each other’s hands in pledge of fidelity. A truce was agreed upon for three
years and eight months; the fort of Askalon was to be destroyed; but
Joppa and Tyre, with the country between them, were to be surrendered to
the Christians. The people of the West were also at liberty to make their
pilgrimages to Jerusalem, exempt from the taxes which the Saracenian
princes had in former times imposed.</p>

<p>The French soldiers at Acre prepared to return to Europe; but wished
first to behold the sepulchre which was so dear and sacred to the Christians.
But Richard was indignant at the audacity of men who claimed the benefit
of a treaty which no efforts of their own had procured. They had lost the
laurel of holy warriors, and they deserved not to bear the pilgrim’s palm.
The rest of the army visited the hallowed places, and Saladin, alive to every
honourable obligation, prevented his subjects from injuring the persons and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
insulting the feelings of the devout palmers. In a familiar conversation
with the bishop of Salisbury Saladin expressed his admiration of the bravery
of Plantagenet, but thought that the skill of the general did not equal the
valour of the knight. The courteous
prelate complimented the Mussulman
by replying that there were not two
such warriors in the world as the
English and the Syrian monarchs.
Often have we had occasion to observe
the generosity of Saladin in the
moment of victory. At the solicitation
of the bishop he allowed establishments
of Latin priests in the
Holy Sepulchre, and in the churches
of Bethlehem and Nazareth. He had
pity, too, on the different barons
whom his conquests had dispossessed.
He gave to the lord of Sajetta a handsome
town near Tyre; to Belian of
Ibelin a castle, four miles from Acre;
and he restored Caiphas, Cæsarea, and
Azotus to their respective lords.
Count Henry of Champagne became
master of Joppa.</p>

<p>The loss of many thousand soldiers
on the plains of Acre, and the bravery
and conduct of the English monarch,
had prevented some of the anticipated
issues of the battle of Tiberias;
Palestine did not become a Mussulman
colony; and so much of the sea coast
was in the hands of the Christians,
and so enfeebled were the enemy,
that fresh hostilities could safely be
commenced whenever Europe should
again pour forth her religious fanatics,
and military adventurers. Richard
gained more honour in Palestine than
any of the emperors of Germany and
kings of France who had sought renown
in foreign war; and although
these distant ages may censure his
conduct as unprofitable to his country,
yet his actions were in unison with
that spirit of the times which looked
upon valour as more important than empire, and esteemed achievements in
battle more highly than the consequences of victory. In the month of
October, Richard, with his queen, the English soldiers, and pilgrims, set sail
for England. But storms of violence, uncommon even for the boisterous
season of autumn, soon scattered the fleet. Many of the vessels were
wrecked on hostile shores, and the warriors of England, now penniless,
naked, and famished, were led into Saracen prisons. Other ships fortunately
reached friendly ports, and in time returned to Britain.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4b4"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>END AND REVIEW OF THE THIRD CRUSADE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1189-1192 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Richard the Lion-hearted as a Crusader</span></p>
</div>

<p>Thus finished this Third Crusade, in which all the western powers in arms
obtained no greater advantages than the taking of Ptolemais and the demolition
of Askalon; in it Germany lost, without glory, one of the greatest of its
emperors and the finest of its armies. If we may believe Arabian authors,
six hundred thousand crusaders appeared before Ptolemais, and scarcely one
hundred thousand of these warriors saw their native country again. Europe
had the greater reason to deplore the losses of this war, from the fact of her
armies having been so much better composed than in preceding expeditions;
criminals, adventurers, and vagabonds had been strictly excluded from the
ranks. All that the West could boast of the most noble and illustrious
of its warriors had taken up arms.</p>

<p>The crusaders that contended with Saladin were better armed and better
disciplined than any that preceded them in Palestine; the foot-soldiers
employed the cross-bow, which had been neglected or prohibited in the
Second Crusade. Their cuirasses, and their bucklers covered with thick
leather, defied the arrows of the Saracens; and on the field of battle, soldiers
were often seen bristling with arrows and darts, whom the Arabs compared
to porcupines, still keeping their ranks and fighting bravely. The Saracens
had likewise made some progress in the art of war, and began to resume the
use of the lance, which they did not employ when the first crusaders arrived
in Syria. The Mussulman armies were not confused multitudes; they
remained longer under their banners, and fought with less disorder. The
Kurds and Turks surpassed the Franks in the art of attacking and defending
cities and castles. The Mussulmans had, besides, more than one advantage
over the crusaders: they made war upon their own territories and in their
own climate; they were under the command of one single leader, who communicated
the same spirit to all, and only presented to them one cause to
defend.</p>

<p>In this crusade the Franks appeared to be more polished than they had
been till that time. Great monarchs making war against each other without
ceasing to give evidences of mutual esteem and generous feeling, was a new
spectacle for the world. Subjects followed the example of their princes, and
lost beneath the tent much of their barbarism. The crusaders were sometimes
admitted to the table of Saladin, and emirs received at that of Richard.
By thus mingling together, Saracens and Christians might make a happy
exchange of usages, manners, knowledge, and even virtues. The Christians,
rather more enlightened than during the first Crusades, stood in less need of
excitement from the visions of fanaticism. The passion for glory was for
them almost as powerful a principle as religious enthusiasm. Chivalry also
made great progress in this crusade; it was held in such honour, and the
title of knight was so glorious, even in the eyes of the infidels, that Saladin
did not disdain to be decorated with it.</p>

<p>In this crusade, in which so many knights rendered themselves illustrious,
two men acquired an immortal glory, one by a useless bravery and
qualities more brilliant than solid, the other by real successes and virtues
that might have served as models to Christians. The name of Richard
remained during a century the terror of the East, and the Saracens and
Turks celebrated him in their proverbs a long time after the Crusades. He
cultivated letters and merited a place among the troubadours; but the arts
did not at all soften his character; it was his ferocity as well as his courage
that procured him the surname of Cœur de Lion. Carried away by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
inconstancy of his inclinations, he often changed his projects, his affections,
and his principles of action; he sometimes braved religion, and very often
devoted himself to its service. Sometimes incredulous, as often superstitious;
measureless in his hatred as in his friendship, he was extravagant
in everything, and only showed himself constant in his love for war. The
passions which animated him scarcely ever permitted his ambition to have an
aim or a determinate object. His imprudence, his presumption, and the
unsteadiness of his plans, made him lose the fruits of his exploits. In a
word, the hero of this crusade is more calculated to excite surprise than
to create esteem, and appears to belong less to history than to the romances
of chivalry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<p class="caption">CHRISTIANS PASSING BEFORE SALADIN</p>
</div>

<p>With less rashness and bravery than Richard, Saladin possessed a more
firm character, one far better calculated to carry on a religious war. He
paid more attention to the results of his enterprises; more master of himself,
he was more fit to command others. When mounting the throne of the
atabegs, Saladin obeyed rather his destiny than his inclinations; but when
once firmly seated, he was governed by only two passions&mdash;that of reigning,
and that of securing the triumph of the <i>Koran</i>. On all other subjects he was
moderate, and when a kingdom or the glory of the prophet was not in
question, the son of Eyyub was admired as the most just and mild of Mussulmans.
We may add that the stern devotion<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and ardent fanaticism that
made him take up arms against the Christians, only rendered him cruel and
barbarous in one single instance. He displayed the virtues of peace amidst
the horrors of war. “From the bosom of camps,” says an oriental poet, “he
covered the nations with the wings of his justice, and poured upon his cities
the plenteous showers of his liberality.” The Mussulmans, always governed
by fear, were astonished that a sovereign could inspire them with so much
love, and followed him with joy to battle. His generosity, his clemency,
and particularly his respect for an oath, were often the subjects of admiration
to the Christians, whom he rendered so miserable by his victories, and of
whose power in Asia he had completed the overthrow.</p>

<p>The Third Crusade, which was so glorious for Saladin, was not entirely
without advantages for Europe. Many crusaders, on the way to Palestine,
stopped in Spain, and by their victories over the Moors, prepared the deliverance
of the kingdoms situated beyond the Pyrenees. A great number of
Germans, as in the Second Crusade, prevailed upon by the solicitations of
the pope, made war upon the barbarous inhabitants of the shores of the Baltic,
and thus, by useful exploits, extended the limits of the Christian republic in
the West. As in this war the greater part of the crusaders went to Palestine
by sea, the art of navigation made a sensible advance; the maritime
nations of Europe acquired an accession of prosperity, their fleets became
more formidable, and they were able, with glory, to dispute the empire of the
sea with the Saracens.</p>

<p>In several states of Europe, commerce, and the spirit of the holy wars
contributed to the enfranchisement of the lower classes. Many serfs, upon
becoming free, took up arms. It was not one of the least interesting spectacles
of this crusade, to see the standards of several cities of France and Germany
floating in the Christian army amongst the banners of lords and
barons. This crusade was particularly beneficial to France, from which it
banished both civil and foreign wars. By prolonging the absence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
great vassals and the enemies of the kingdom, it weakened their power, and
gave Philip Augustus authority to levy imposts, even upon the clergy. It
afforded him an opportunity of surrounding his throne with a faithful guard,
to keep up regular armies, and prepare, though at a distance, that victory of
Bouvines which proved so fatal to the enemies of France.</p>

</div>

<p>A long captivity awaited Richard on his return to Europe. The vessel
in which he embarked was shipwrecked on the coast of Italy, and fearing to
pass through France, he took the route of Germany, concealed under the
habit of a simple pilgrim. His liberality betrayed the monarch, and as he
had enemies everywhere, he was seized by the soldiers of the duke of Austria.
Leopold had not sufficient generosity to forget the outrages received from
Richard at the siege of Ptolemais, and detained him prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The duke of
Austria did not dare to detain his redoubtable captive in his own hands, and
gave him up to the emperor of Germany. Henry VI, who had likewise insults
to revenge, was rejoiced to get Richard in
his power, and kept him in chains, as if he had
made him a prisoner in the field of battle.
The hero of the crusade, who had filled the
world with his renown, was cast into a dark
dungeon, and remained a long time a victim
to the vengeance of his enemies&mdash;and they
were Christian princes. He was brought
before the German diet, assembled at Worms,
where he was accused of all the crimes that
hatred and envy could invent. But the
spectacle of a king in chains was so affecting,
that no one durst condemn Richard, and
when he offered his justification, the bishops
and nobles melted into tears, and besought
Henry to treat him with less injustice and
rigour.</p>

<p>Queen Eleanor implored all the powers
of Europe for the release of her son. The
complaints and tears of a mother touched the
heart of Celestine, who had recently ascended
the chair of St. Peter. The pope several
times demanded the liberty of the king of
England, and even excommunicated the duke
of Austria and the emperor; but the thunders
of the church had so often been launched
against the thrones of Germany, that they
no longer inspired fear. Henry braved the
anathemas of the holy see; the captivity of Richard lasted another year; and
he only obtained his liberty after engaging to pay a considerable ransom.
His kingdom, which he had ruined at his departure for the Holy Land,
exhausted itself to hasten his return; and England gave up even her sacred
vases to break the chains of her monarch. He was received with enthusiasm
by the English; his adventures, which drew tears, obliterated the remembrance
of his cruelties, and Europe only recollected his exploits and his
misfortunes.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4c2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4c">c</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<h5>DEATH OF SALADIN; ARAB EULOGIES</h5>

<p>In the year 589 (1193 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), after the departure of the king of England,
Saladin having no longer anything to fear from the Christians, resolved to
pass some time at Damascus. This was always a favourite place of sojourn,
and he hoped there to recover his health, for he was feeling severely the
strain of so arduous a war. His plan, after resting a while in Damascus,
was to go to Egypt, which he had not visited for ten years. He left Jerusalem
and paid visits en route to Nablus, Tiberias, and other scenes of his
recent conquests. At Berytus, Bohemond, prince of Antioch, came to pay
allegiance. What most touched the sultan was that Bohemond came of his
own accord, without distrust, without escort, without even having requested
a safe conduct. As evidence of his satisfaction the sultan gave him a splendid
welcome, and granted him several fiefs contiguous to his own principality.
The lords who came with him also received presents. Saladin
finally arrived in Damascus amid the acclamations of the populace. Great
was the rejoicing, and poets exercised their art for the occasion. The sultan
immediately took in hand the welfare of the inhabitants and reformed
several abuses. In the meanwhile he betook himself with his brother Malik
Adil to the pleasures of the chase. He was away a fortnight; his health
seemed restored, and already he began to believe himself beyond all danger,
when suddenly he fell ill of a bilious fever of which he died on the thirteenth
day, March 5, 1193. Boha ad-Din, who at the time of Saladin’s death was in
the city, relates that grief was universal. “That day,” he says, “was the
most terrible that had ever dawned on Islam. The castle of Damascus,
the city, the whole universe was struck with a sorrow that God alone could
measure.”</p>

<p>Saladin was born at Tekrit, on the Tigris, and died at the age of fifty-seven
lunar years, after having reigned twenty-four years over Egypt and
nineteen over Syria. Arabian historians represent him as a most generous
prince, who would ever willingly deprive himself of the necessaries of life.
Boha ad-Din avows that finally his steward felt obliged, unknown to him, to
put aside money in order to meet future emergencies; at his death they
found in his treasury forty-seven silver pieces and one of gold. “This,”
adds Boha ad-Din, “was all that remained of the revenues of Egypt, Arabia,
Syria, and a part of Mesopotamia.”</p>

<p>It always happened that when Saladin took possession of a new province
he performed deeds of great generosity in order to win over the people.
When he entered Damascus after the death of Nur ad-Din, he did not take for
himself any of this prince’s treasures, but distributed everything among the
emirs. “Saladin,” says Abulfeda, “had gentle manners, he bore contradiction
easily, and showed great indulgence to those who served him. If anything
wounded his feelings he did not exhibit it. He was reserved in
speech; and his example inspired the same thing in others. No one dared
attack his neighbour’s honour in the sultan’s presence.</p>

<p>“He never could see an orphan without being moved. If one of its
parents were still alive he gave it into this parent’s keeping, but himself
provided for the child’s maintenance and kept watch over its education.
Whenever he met an aged person he wept tenderly and bestowed some
token of generosity. Such was his manner of life until God called him to
his merciful bosom.”</p>

<p>Saladin was not insensible to domestic affection. He loved to spend his
time with his family, surrounded by his children, and taking part in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
sports. He was sincerely devoted to his religion and brought up his children in
the same way. Boha ad-Din has preserved for us the sultan’s speech, a short
time before his death, on the occasion of the departure of his son Dhahir to
the post of governor of Aleppo. “O my son,” the sultan said, “I recommend
to thee the fear of God, source of all goodness. Do what God asks, and
thou shalt find in that thy salvation. Hold always the sight of blood in horror.
Take care not to shed or stain thyself with it, for the mark is never washed
away. Look to the well-being of thy subjects and inform thyself as to their
needs. Thou art for them God’s minister as well as mine. Take care to
please the emirs, the great men of the land, and the people of high estate. It
is by my righteous ways that I have reached this degree of power. Bear no
malice towards anyone whoever he may be, for we are all mortal. Be attentive
to thy duty to others, for in giving them satisfaction thou obtainest the
forgiveness of God better than looking to thy own account with him, for
repentance to cure all; for the Lord is good and merciful.”</p>

<p>He loved to read the <i>Koran</i> and he had the book read to his servitors and
all those around him. Noticing one day a little child reading the <i>Koran</i> to
his father, he was touched to tears by the sight and gave money and land
to both father and son. He admitted unreservedly all that religion teaches,
and hated philosophers and heretics. He once imprisoned and put to death
at Aleppo a young man named Sahraverdi, who mocked at and insulted
religion.</p>

<p>Boha ad-Din relates again: “Saladin was a great lover of justice; not
only was he strict on its being given, but he dispensed it himself as far as
his affairs would admit. He heard cases twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays,
assisted by cadis and people of the law. Great and small, everyone
found the door open. He did the same on his journeys as in his capital,
receiving all petitions presented to him, and rejecting no demands. When a
case demanded a great amount of attention he examined it at leisure, sometimes
in the day, sometimes at night, and judged it as God prompted him.
Never was his sense of justice invoked in vain; it was the same for the
princes of his family as for his other subjects, for he made exception of no
one.”</p>

<p>There would be no end were one to transcribe all that the Arab chroniclers,
particularly Boha ad-Din, relate concerning Saladin’s justice and piety.
The latter is especially devoted to bringing out these virtues of his hero,
and purposely omits to speak of the vices that stained them. In the whole
course of his reign Saladin encountered no great opposition except on the
part of the Christians, and especially those of the West. So he had come
to believe in no enemies but the Franks. These he treated as enemies of
God, and called the war they brought upon him, “the holy war.”</p>

<p>“When God shall have put into my hands the other Christian cities,” he
told Boha ad-Din,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4f1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4f">f</a></span> “I shall share my states with my children, leave them my
last instructions, and bidding them farewell, embark upon that sea to subdue
the western isles and lands. I shall never lay down my arms while there
remains a single infidel upon the earth, at least if from here to there I am
not stopped by death.”</p>

<p>Thus Saladin’s ambitions reached as far as the conquest of France, Italy,
and the other Christian countries. And lest one should believe the words
reported by Boha ad-Din to be a vain threat, we find the same idea in the
sultan’s reply to a letter from the emperor Barbarossa. What is more
singular is that the hate of Saladin was directed towards the Christians only
as a body of nations. Once in his power, he looked at them through different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
eyes. Thus we can explain the magnificent and even exaggerated eulogies
of certain contemporary Christian and especially Italian writers, eulogies
which perhaps no Mohammedan writer has exceeded. For example, there is
the following passage in the Arab history of the patriarchs of Alexandria,
whose author was one of the Coptic Christians:</p>

<p>“Saladin in all the surrenders he had from the Franks was faithful to his
word. When a town capitulated he left the inhabitants their liberty, with
their wives, their children, and their belongings. As to their Mohammedan
captives, Saladin offered to buy them back, and mentioned a sum greater
than their value. If the Franks refused this he let them keep their prisoners,
saying, ‘I don’t want to interfere with your captives; only treat them
well, as I treat your people.’ Whenever his policy would permit it Saladin
sought to please everybody. ‘I much prefer,’ he said, speaking of the
Christians, ‘that they should remain contented and happy.’”</p>

<p>Saladin’s two most glorious achievements in the eye of the majority of
the Mohammedan historians were the taking of Jerusalem and Palestine
from the Christians, and the destruction of the Fatimite caliphate in Egypt.
To these relate most of the titles and phrases in which they refer to him and
which may be found on many monuments of the period. “With Saladin,”
says Imad ad-Din, his secretary, “the great men perished, with him disappeared
people of true worth; good deeds diminished, and bad ones increased;
life became difficult, and earth was covered with shadows; the century had
its phœnix to deplore, and Islam lost its support.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4k"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4k">k</a></span></p>

<h5>FOOTNOTES</h5>

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> Among the causes of the First Crusade we mentioned the influence of the spirit of commerce
on the love of pilgrimages. That spirit was afterwards mingled with the desire of conquest, particularly
in the case of the Egyptian polities. Situated between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean,
Egypt was the communication between Europe and the Indies; and the possession of
that country would have rendered the Europeans masters of commerce.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> There was a decree in these statutes forbidding a crusader to take any woman with him,

Calycadnus: “If he went in to wash himself, he neither consulted with his health nor honour.
Some say, his horse foundered under him as he passed the water; others, that he fell from him.
But these several relations, as variety of instruments, make a doleful concert in this, that there
he lost his life; and no wonder, if the cold water quickly quenched those few sparks of natural
heat left in him at seventy years of age.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fuller.</span><span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4i"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4i">i</a></span></p>

of luxury. Pagans and Christians considering God as the author of temporal good and evil only,
and observing that the virtuous suffered as much as the wicked, concluded that moral conduct
was disregarded by heaven. Unbounded licentiousness followed. No laws of God limited the
people: the laws of man were equally inefficacious, because the criminal thought that he might
die before the day of trial, or if he should live to that time, those who would have been his
accusers might have perished in the general calamity. Compare Thucydides’ account of the

marched forwards with a quiet step, and without trepidation. “So close did they march, that if

armies lived in friendly intercourse, and mingled in the tournament and dance. More than this,
through the whole of the war, Saladin and Richard emulated each other as much in the reciprocation

sent him presents of Damascene pears, peaches, and other fruits. The same liberal hand gave
the luxury of snow, in the hot seasons, according to Hoveden.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_4h"><a href="#crusades_endnote_4h">h</a></span> Saladin could not but have felt

<p>Wars and rebellions had filled all the thoughts of Saladin, and he had
established no principles of succession. Three of his numerous progeny
became sovereigns of Aleppo, Damascus, and Egypt; others had smaller possessions,
and the emirs and atabegs of Syria again struggled for independence.
The soldiers of the late sultan rallied round his brother Saphedin
[Saif ad-Din] whose wisdom and valour were familiar to them. Both by
stratagem and liberal policy he reared a large fabric of empire in Syria, and
he was the most powerful of all the Moslem princes, when the time for the
expiration of the peace arrived. The Saracenic power was, however, palsied
for a while by a dreadful famine in Egypt, and the Latins in Palestine
suffered also from the miserable state of this general granary.</p>

<p>The knights of St. John cast their regards towards Europe, and particularly
to England, for succour, and entreated that new armies would march
to Palestine, and destroy the exhausted Moslems.</p>

<h5>POPE CELESTINE III PROMOTES A CRUSADE (1195 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1195-1198 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Two years before this favourable moment, the daring and ambitious pope
Celestine III had again sounded the trumpet of war. France had not revived
from its losses in the Third Crusade, and Philip Augustus heard the
appeal with indifference. Many of the people of England enrolled their
names as holy warriors, obtained spiritual absolution, and then abandoned
their pious resolves. The pope hurled his thunders against those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
deserted their profession, except for some legitimate cause; but all thoughts
of a crusade gradually died away in England, for the king was too much
occupied in political concerns to encourage it. But wild schemes of war
were occasionally in his mind, and the early writers have ascribed to his
dauntless spirit the vast design of conquering Egypt and, after having
gained the Holy Land, of possessing himself of the throne of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Designs equally ambitious were entertained by the emperor Henry, the
enemy of Plantagenet. Seconded by imperial influence, the clergy successfully
preached the crusade through all the German states. The emperor
declared that he would provide a passage for both rich and poor who wished
to go. But, though influenced, he was not absorbed by the love of barren
glory, and when the possession of Sicily seemed an easy achievement, he
postponed the gathering of laurels in Palestine till he had added a great
state to his empire in Europe. Tancred, prince of Sicily, had lately died,
and Henry, in right of his wife Constanza, put in his claims. This defection
from the holy war was declared to be in accordance with the opinions of
his wisest princes and lords, and it did not quench the spirit of fanaticism
and romance.</p>

<h5>THE FOURTH (OR GERMAN) CRUSADE (1195-1198 A.D.)</h5>

<p>From the north to the south of Germany the frenzy of crusading had
spread, and it had infected the bishops of Bremen, Würzburg, Passau, and
Ratisbon; the dukes of Saxony, Brabant, Bavaria, and the son of the duke
of Austria; the marquis of Brandenburg and Moravia; the landgraf of
Thuringia; the count Palatine, and the counts of Habsburg and Schwembourg.
The son of Henry duke of Limburg and the archbishop of Mainz
led the vanguard of the holy warriors; and in the passage through Hungary
they were joined by Margaret, sister of the French king and queen of
Hungary, who, as one mode of consolation for the loss of her husband, had
vowed to pass the remainder of her life in the pains of pilgrimage. Though
the time of peace, as settled by the treaty between Richard and Saladin, had
expired, yet the Christians and Mussulmans continued to live in amity.
When the new champions of the cross arrived at Acre, no remonstrances of
the Latins against fresh wars, no suggestions that all new crusaders ought to
be obedient to the discretion of the residents in the Holy Land could abate
the furious desire of the Germans for hostility.</p>

<p>Their aggressions were quickly returned by the Mussulmans, civil feuds
were hushed, and Saphedin again headed the veteran forces of Syria and
of Egypt. The important city of Joppa was taken by him before the
Christian army from Acre could relieve it. The care and expense of
Richard were dissipated in a moment; the fortifications were destroyed,
and several thousands of the people of Joppa were put to the sword. In
these unhappy moments another portion of the German force, under the
command of the dukes of the lower Lorraine and Saxony, arrived at Acre.
They had made the voyage from the northern ports of Germany, and in their
route had chastised the Moors of Portugal. Confident in their strength, the
united forces of Europe and Palestine, led by the duke of Saxony, directed
their march towards the city of Berytus; but Saphedin, ever observant of
events, quitted the vicinity of Joppa, and overtook his foes between Tyre
and Sidon. The close columns of the duke of Saxony’s army were impenetrable
to his vigorous and continual attacks. The victory of the Christians
appeared to be decisive, the enemy’s force was scattered, and so extensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
was the panic that the Saracens abandoned Laodicea, Gabala, Joppa, Sidon,
and Berytus. Nine thousand prisoners were redeemed without ransom; and
the statement that there were three years’ provisions for the inhabitants
of Berytus in the storehouses of that town shows the importance of the day of
Sidon. The exultation of the crusaders was still further advanced by the
arrival of a third body of friends, headed by Conrad, bishop of Hidelsheim
and chancellor of the German Empire. By the usual process of ambitious
princes Henry had subjugated Sicily; and now, devoted to the conquest of
the Holy Land, he sent his third army as his immediate precursors.</p>

<p>It seemed that the hour was now at hand when Europe would receive
the reward of her invincible heroism. All the sea coast of Palestine was
already in the possession of the Christians: and even they who had generally
most desponded were now elevated with the conviction that the cross
must ere long surmount the walls of Jerusalem. But in their march from
Tyre towards the Holy City they made a fatal halt at the fortress of
Thoron. The lofty and solid pile of stones withstood the attacks of the
common engines of violence. But by a month’s labour of some Saxon miners
the rock itself which supported the fortress was pierced through; and the
battlements tottered to their foundation. The Saracens were now at the feet
of the Christians suing for clemency. A free passage into the Moslem territories
was all that they asked, and the fort might then be at the disposal
of the crusaders. After much time had been passed in balancing considerations
of revenge or mercy, a treaty founded on these terms was signed;
but although just principles of war prevailed with the majority, yet the
smaller party, who breathed nothing but slaughter, impressed their menaces
so deeply on the minds of the Saracens that the latter vowed to submit to
the last extremity, rather than confide in the agreements and oaths of champions
of the cross.</p>

<p>They gained resolution from despair; they met their foes in the passages
which had been mined in the rocks; and in every encounter the Moslem
scimitar reeked with Christian blood. Factious contentions disordered the
Latin council; insubordination and vice raged in the camp; and, to crown
their miseries, the crusaders heard that the infidel world had recovered from
its defeat at Sidon, and that the sultans of Egypt and Syria were concentrating
their levies. Daunted at the rumour of their march, the German
princes deserted their posts in the middle of the night, and fled to Tyre. In
the morning their flight was discovered by the soldiers, and horror and
despair seized every breast. The camp was deserted by those who had
strength to move; the feeble left their property, the cowardly their arms
behind them. The road to Tyre was filled with soldiers and baggage in
indiscriminate confusion; but so exhausted was the state of the Mussulmans
in Thoron, that the Christians were not molested in their retreat by
any accidents except those which their own imprudence and precipitation
occasioned (1197).</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1198-1201 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>When the fragments of the army were collected, and the soldiers were
at a distance from danger, everyone reproached the other as the cause of
the late disgraceful event. The Germans accused the Latins of cowardice;
and the barons of the Holy Land declared that they would not submit to the
domineering pride of the Germans. All the quarrels were conducted in scriptural
language. Treachery was the crime of which each party accused the
other; for the case of Judas was in the minds of all. Conrad and his soldiers
went to Joppa, and resolved to repair its fortifications and to await the moment
for revenge on the Latins of Syria. Saphedin marched against them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
and the Germans did not decline the combat. Victory was on the side of the
Christians; but it was bought by the death of many brave warriors, particularly
of the duke of Saxony, and of the son of the duke of Austria. But the
Germans did not profit by this success, for news arrived from Europe that
the great support of the Crusade, Henry VI, was dead. The archbishop of
Mainz, and all those princes who had an interest in the election of a German
sovereign, deserted the Holy Land. The queen of Hungary was the only
individual of consequence whose fanaticism was stronger than worldly considerations.
The remnants, and they were more than twenty thousand, of
this once powerful host fortified themselves in Joppa. But a new storm
arose in the Turkish states. It swept over Berytus and the land of the
Christians; and, on the 11th of November, while the Germans were celebrating
the feast of St. Martin, the Moslems entered the city of Joppa and slew
every individual whom they found.</p>

<p>Old Fuller<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5f1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5f">f</a></span> says, “At this time, the spring-tide of their mirth so
drowned their souls that the Turks, coming in upon them, cut every one of
their throats to the number of twenty thousand; and quickly they were
stabbed with the sword that were cup-shot before. A day which the Dutch
(the Germans) may well write in their calendars in red letters dyed with their
own blood, when the camp was their shambles, the Turks their butchers, and
themselves the Martinmasse beeves, from which the beastly drunkards differ
but a little.”</p>

<p>About the time of the massacre at Joppa, Henry, count of Champagne,
the acknowledged king of Jerusalem, died. The grand master of the Hospitallers
represented to Isabella the propriety of her marriage with Almeric
de Lusignan, king of Cyprus, who had lately succeeded his brother Guy. It
was thought that Acre and its vicinity could not remain in the hands of the
Latins unless they were governed by a king, and that, in every circumstance,
Cyprus, as a place of succour and retreat, would be a valuable ally to Jerusalem.
With equal truth it might have been argued that, if there were a
powerful king in Palestine, faction, the great foe of the state, could not raise
its head. Familiarised to the joys of royalty and love, the widowed queen
embraced with rapture new prospects of happiness, and in her eyes Almeric
was as estimable as she had found her divorced husband Humphry, or her
deceased lords Conrad and Henry. The union was approved of by the clergy
and barons, it was celebrated at Acre, and Almeric and Isabella were proclaimed
king and queen of Cyprus and Jerusalem.</p>

<h5>THE FIFTH CRUSADE (1201-1204 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1201-1204 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Third and Fourth Crusades were created by the ordinary influence
of papal power and royal authority; but the Fifth sprang from genuine
fanaticism. At the close of the twelfth century a hero arose in France, worthy
of companionship with Bernard. Fulk, of the town of Neuilly, near Paris,
was distinguished by the vehemence and ability of his preaching, and as in
early life he had drank deeply of the cup of pleasure he was well qualified
to describe the different states of the sinner and the saint. He did not
involve himself in the speculative absurdities of the day, but declaimed
against the prevailing vices of usury and prostitution. For two years he
preached without success, but after that time “heaven lent its aid to the
efforts of the preacher, in order that his words, like arrows from a powerful
bow, might penetrate the depraved hearts of men.” Accordingly, miracles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
attested celestial approbation, and his sermons were received as oracles.
With the extension of his fame his wishes for religious good increased, and
his soul was inflamed with the desire of accomplishing the great aim of
Christendom. He accordingly assumed the cross, and war with the infidels
became the copious matter of his sermons.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5c1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5c">c</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thirteenth Century Crusader</span></p>
</div>

<p>The Fifth Crusade was an individual enterprise. Since the failure of
the Third, Jerusalem was forgotten and wars between kings and Christian
peoples took the place of the pious expeditions. England, Germany, and
France, once united for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, were now armed
one against the other. The emperor Otto IV was excommunicated; Philip
Augustus had been, John was to be. All
these excommunicants gave little thought
to the Holy Land. The great pope Innocent
III wanted to bring it back to their
minds and caused a new crusade to be
preached, promising the remission of all
sins to those who served God for one year.
Fulk the curé was the pope’s mouthpiece.
He visited a tournament that was being held
in Champagne, and his burning words made
all the princes and knights assembled there
assume the cross. This time, as on the first,
the kings held aloof, and the people did also.
Knighthood alone took part, and rather to
show strength of arms than any deep piety,
for the affair was nothing more, or little
more, than a plundering expedition. Baldwin IX, count of Flanders, and
Boniface II, count of Montferrat, were at its head. And it had been previously
proved that the sea route was much preferable to the land, the
crusaders sought ships at Venice.</p>

<p>That city was even then the Queen of the Adriatic. Driven by Attila’s
invasion to the lagoons, the people from the mainland had prospered in that
most remarkable situation in the world. None of the invasions that passed
over Italy had reached them. Their trade had extended, and the islands
and shores of Istria and Illyria recognised their superiority. When the
crusaders appeared, the Venetians encouraged them not only through piety
but the spirit of gain as well. The Mohammedans and Greeks were their
rivals in the eastern Mediterranean and they found this a good opportunity
to dispossess them. The interested services rendered the crusaders in 1130
had brought the Venetians the privilege of opening in each town of the new
kingdom of Jerusalem a quarter exclusively their own, and at the same
time they took possession of the Greek islands of Rhodes, Samos, Scio,
Mytilene, and Andros. In 1173 Venice had made its dogeship elective, and
established with its grand council that aristocratic government which kept
its power through many ages.</p>

<p>Such was Venice when the crusaders put in an appearance. Geoffrey de
Villehardouin,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5g"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5g">g</a></span> seneschal to the court of Champagne, himself narrates the
mission in which he took part. It was a curious sight&mdash;that of the feudal
lords obliged, kneeling and in tears, to beg the people humbly for ships.
“We will grant them; we will grant them,” replied the sovereign people.
City of merchants and seamen, Venice could not but sell such a service,
and demanded 85,000 marks or 20,230 kilograms of silver, which to-day
would be equal to about £161,840 or $809,200, but in those days was worth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
much more. The knights could not produce such a sum, and in place of
cash the Venetians offered to take in payment a hostile city if the crusaders
would capture it for them. They had already taken from the Greeks the
principal cities of the Dalmatian coast&mdash;Spalato, Ragusa, and Sebenico.
One alone remained to prevent their complete dominion over the Adriatic&mdash;Zara,
still occupied by the king of Hungary. In vain did Innocent III
thunder against this detour from the crusade; the Venetians got Zara and
Doge Dandolo, ninety years old, assumed the cross (1202).</p>

<p>The little account settled, they could go; but whither? The set-backs
of the last Crusades showed that it was necessary to have some point of
support in order to operate successfully in Palestine, and this point must be
either Egypt or the Greek Empire. The Venetians persuaded their allies
that the keys of Jerusalem were either at Cairo or Constantinople. There
was some truth in this idea, but there was much more commercial interest.
The possession of Cairo would give the Venetians the route to India; that
of Constantinople would assure them the commerce of the Black Sea and
the whole Grecian archipelago. The crusaders decided on Constantinople,
whither a young Greek prince, Alexius, offered to lead them provided they
would re-establish on the throne his father Isaac Angelus who had been
deposed (1203).</p>

<p>The account of the assault on Constantinople, given more fully in the history
of the Byzantine Empire, may be briefly sketched here. When the
French came in sight of Constantinople, saw its high walls, its innumerable
churches whose gilded domes glistened in the sun, and their glances wandered,
as Villehardouin says, “over the length and breadth of the city, sovereign
of all others, there was none so brave whose heart did not tremble, and each
one looked at the arms which he would soon need.” Along the shore there
was lined up a magnificent army of sixty thousand men. The crusaders
counted on a terrible battle. Barges brought them fully armed to the shore.
Before even touching the strand “the knights jumped into the water up to
their waists, fully armed, the lance men, the sword bearers, the good archers,
and the good sergeants, and the good cross-bowmen. And the Greeks made
much pretext to stop them. And when the crusaders came with lowered
lances, the Greeks turned their backs and fled, leaving them the shore. And
know that nothing more glorious ever took place.” The 18th of July (1203)
the city was carried by assault; the old emperor was brought from his cell
and put back on the throne. Alexius had made the crusaders the most
glowing promises; to keep them he imposed new taxes and so angered the
weakened people that they strangled their emperor, set up another, Mourzoufle,
and shut the city’s gates. The crusaders attacked at once. Three
days sufficed to get them in again (March, 1204); this time they put it to
the sack. One whole quarter, a square league of territory, was burned.
And what works of art perished! Four hundred thousand marks were collected
in a church for distribution.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Then they divided the empire up. Baldwin IV, count of Flanders, was
elected emperor of Romania. He won against his opponents, Dandolo and
Boniface of Montferrat. The Venetians did not like the idea of seeing their
doge on the imperial throne. They took (which pleased them better) a
portion of Constantinople with the shore of the Bosporus and the Propontis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
and a majority of the Archipelago islands, Candia, etc., and dubbed themselves
lords of a quarter and a half of the Eastern Empire. The marquis
of Montferrat was elected king of Macedonia; Villehardouin, marshal of
Romania, and his nephew, prince of Romania. The count of Blois received
the Asiatic provinces. There were dukes of Athens and Naxos, counts of
Cephalonia, and lords of Thebes and of Corinth. A new France, with all
its feudal customs, arose at the eastern end of Europe. Members of the
Comnenus family, however, managed to keep several portions which they
divided into principalities&mdash;Trebizond, Napoli of Argolis, Epirus and Nicæa.
But the crusaders were too few to hold their conquest long. In 1261 this
Latin Empire fell to pieces. But, up to the end of the Middle Ages and the
conquests of the Turks, there still subsisted in certain parts of Greece
remnants of the feudal principalities so strangely established by the French
in the ancient land of Miltiades and Leonidas.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5b"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5b">b</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1204-1261 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The establishment of the Latins in Constantinople was the important
though unlooked-for issue of the Fifth Crusade; but their dominion lasted
only fifty-seven years. The history of that period forms a part of the
annals of the Lower Empire, and not of the holy wars. But we may remark,
generally, that in a very few years fortune ceased to smile on the
conquerors. Their arrogant and encroaching temper awakened the jealousy
of the king of Bulgaria. The fierce mountaineers, who had so often
insulted the majesty of the Roman Empire, now redeemed themselves from
the sin of rebellion, by ceaseless war on the usurpers of their former master’s
throne. The change of the Greek ritual into the service of the Latin church,
was a subject of perpetual murmur and discontent. The feudal code of the
kingdom of Jerusalem was violently imposed on the people, in utter contempt
of their manners and opinions. The Greeks, too, were not admitted
into any places of confidence in the government, and the nobility gradually
retired from Constantinople, and associated themselves with the princes of
the deposed royal family. Several of those princes formed states out of the
ruins of the empire, and Manuel Palæologus, the emperor of Nicæa, descendant
of Lascaris, son-in-law of the usurper Alexius, had the glory of recovering
the throne of the Cæsars, and of finally expelling the usurpers from
Constantinople. On the Asiatic side of the Bosporus the Latins never had
much power.</p>

<p>The jealousy which Genoa entertained of her great rival, Venice, was
one of the most active causes of the fall of the Latin Empire. In the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, commercial concessions had often purchased for Constantinople
the military and naval aid of the sovereign of the Adriatic; and
at the time of the Fifth Crusade, the empire appeared to acknowledge the
equality of the republic. The imperial throne gained the friendship of
other Italian princes, and the Pisans as well as the Venetians had almost
unlimited commerce with the Grecian states. Each of these allies had its
church and its exchange in Constantinople; its consuls decided the causes
of their respective citizens, and both nations enjoyed the rare and blessed
privilege of exemption from payment of public taxes. In the middle of the
twelfth century, Genoa had obtained commercial immunities; but it does
not appear that they were so extensive as those which had been acceded to
the Venetians and Pisans. When the crusaders captured Constantinople,
the commerce of the Black Sea was open to the Venetians, a commerce,
which before that event had only been slightly enjoyed by the Italians. The
Genoese, alarmed at the maritime progress of the Venetians, took up arms
against them; fortune befriended the inferior power, and in the year 1215<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
a treaty was concluded, whereby the Genoese were confirmed in the commercial
privileges which they had enjoyed under the Greek emperor. But
the political situation of the Venetians continued a great source of superiority,
and their rivals incited and assisted the Greeks to throw off the Latin
yoke, and recapture Byzantium.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5c2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>RESULTS OF THE FIFTH CRUSADE</h5>

<p>An old empire which moulders away, a new empire ready to sink into
ruins&mdash;such are the pictures that this crusade presents to us; never did any
epoch offer greater exploits for admiration, or greater troubles for commiseration.
The Greeks, a degenerate nation, honoured their misfortunes by
no virtue; they had neither sufficient courage to prevent the reverses of
war, nor sufficient resignation to support them. When reduced to despair,
they showed some little valour; but that valour was imprudent and blind;
it precipitated them into new calamities, and procured them masters much
more barbarous than those whose yoke they were so eager to shake off.
They had no leader able to govern or guide them; no sentiment of patriotism
strong enough to rally them; deplorable example of a nation left to itself,
which has lost its morals, and has no confidence in its laws or its government!
The Franks had just the same advantages over their enemies
that the barbarians of the north had over the Romans of the Lower Empire.
In this terrible conflict, simplicity of manners, the energy of a new people
for civilisation, the ardour for pillage, and the pride of victory, were sure to
prevail over the love of luxury, habits formed amidst corruption, and vanity
which attaches importance to the most frivolous things, and only preserves a
gaudy resemblance of true grandeur.</p>

<p>This spirit of conquest, which appeared so general among the knights,
might favour the expedition to Constantinople; but it was injurious to the
holy war, by turning the crusaders aside from the essential object of the
crusade. The heroes of this war did nothing for the deliverance of Jerusalem,
of which they constantly spoke in their letters to the pope. The conquest
of Byzantium, very far from being, as the knights believed, the road
to the land of Christ, was but a new obstacle to the taking of the Holy City;
their imprudent exploits placed the Christian colonies in greater peril, and
only ended in completely subverting, without replacing it, a power which
might have served as a barrier against the Saracens. To recapitulate in a
few words our opinion of the events and consequences of this crusade,
we must say that the spirit of chivalry and the spirit of conquest at first
gave birth to wonders, but that they did not suffice to maintain the crusaders
in their possessions. The crusaders evinced a profound contempt for
the Greeks, whose alliance and support they ought to have been anxious to
seek; they wished to reform manners and alter opinions, a much more
difficult task than the conquest of an empire, and only met with enemies in
a country that might have furnished them with useful allies.</p>

<p>We may add that the policy of the holy see, which at first undertook to
divert the Latin warriors from the expedition to Constantinople, became, in
the end, one of the greatest obstacles to the preservation of their conquests.
The counts and barons, who reproached themselves with having failed in
obedience to the sovereign pontiff, at length followed scrupulously his
instructions to procure by their arms the submission of the Greek church,
the only condition on which the holy father would pardon a war commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
in opposition to his commands. To obtain his forgiveness and approbation,
they employed violence against schism and heresy, and lost their conquest
by endeavouring to justify it in the eyes of the sovereign pontiff. The pope
himself did not obtain that which he so ardently desired. The union of the
Greek and Roman churches could not possibly be effected amidst the terrors
of victory and the evils of war; the arms of the conquerors had less power
than the anathemas of the church, to bring back the Greeks to the worship
of the Latins. Violence only served to irritate men’s minds, and consummated
the rupture, instead of putting an end to it. The remembrance of
persecutions and outrages, a reciprocal contempt, an implacable hatred arose
and became implanted between the two creeds, and separated them forever.</p>

<p>History cannot affirm that this crusade made great progress in the civilisation
of Europe. The Greeks had preserved the jurisprudence of Justinian;
the empire possessed wise regulations upon the levying of imposts and the
administration of the public revenues; but the Latins disdained these monuments
of human wisdom and of the experience of many ages; they coveted
nothing the Greeks possessed but their territories and their wealth. Most
of the knights took a pride in their ignorance, and amongst the spoils of
Constantinople, attached no value to the ingenious productions of Greece.
Amidst the conflagrations that consumed the mansions and palaces of the
capital, they beheld with indifference large and valuable libraries given up
to the flames. We may add that the necessity for both conquerors and conquered
of intercommunication must have contributed to the spreading of the
Latin language among the Greeks, and that of the Greeks among the Latins.</p>

<p>The crusaders likewise profited by several useful inventions, and transmitted
them to their compatriots; and the fields and gardens of Italy and
France were enriched by some plants till that time unknown in the West.
Boniface sent into his marquisate some seeds of maize, which had never
before been cultivated in Italy; a public document, which still exists, attests
the gratitude of the people of Montferrat. The magistrates received the
innocent fruits of victory with great solemnity, and, upon their altars, called
down a blessing upon a production of Greece, that would one day constitute
the wealth of the plains of Italy.</p>

<p>Flanders, Champagne, and most of the provinces of France, which had
sent their bravest warriors to the crusade, fruitlessly lavished their population
and their treasures upon the conquest of Byzantium. We may say that
these intrepid fighters gained nothing by this wonderful war, but the glory
of having given, for a moment, masters to Constantinople, and lords to
Greece. And yet these distant conquests, and this new empire, which
drew from France its turbulent and ambitious princes, must have been
favourable to the French monarchy. Philip Augustus must have been pleased
by the absence of the great vassals of the crown, and had reason to learn
with joy that the count of Flanders, a troublesome neighbour, and a not very
submissive vassal, had obtained an empire in the East. The French monarchy
thus derived some advantage from this crusade; but the republic of
Venice profited much more by it. This republic, which scarcely possessed a
population of two hundred thousand souls, and had not the power to make
its authority respected on the continent, in the first place, made use of the
arms of the crusaders, to subdue cities, of which, without their assistance,
she could never have made herself mistress. By the conquest of Constantinople,
she enlarged her credit and her commerce in the East, and brought
under her laws some of the richest possessions of the Greek emperors.
She increased the reputation of her navy, and raised herself above all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
maritime nations of Europe. The Venetians never neglected the interests
or glory of their own country, whilst the French knights scarcely ever
fought for any object but personal glory and their own ambition. Of her
new possessions in the East, Venice only retained such as she judged necessary
to the prosperity of her commerce, or the maintenance of her marine.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5d"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5d">d</a></span></p>

<h5>THE CHILDREN’S CRUSADE (1212 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1212 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Some of the best witnesses for the history of the Middle Ages affirm
that, seduced by the preaching of fanatics, the children of France and
Germany, about the year 1212, thought themselves authorised by heaven
to attempt the rescue of the Sepulchre, and
ran about the country, crying, “Lord Jesus
Christ, restore thy cross to us.” Boys and
girls stole from their homes, “no bolts, no
bars, no fear of fathers or love of mothers,
could hold them back,” and the number
of youthful converts was thirty thousand.
They were organised by some fanatical
wretches, one of whom was taken and
hanged at Cologne. The children drove
down France, crossed the Alps, and those
who survived thirst, hunger, and heat, presented
themselves at the gates of the seaports
of Italy and the south of France.
Many were driven back to their homes;
but seven large ships full of them went
from Marseilles; two of the vessels were
wrecked on the isle of St. Peter, the rest
of the ships went to Bougie and Alexandria,
and the masters sold the children
to slavery. These singular events are
mentioned by four contemporary writers.
(1) Alberic, monk of Trois Fontaines, in
his chronicle. (2) Godfrey of St. Pantaleon,
in his annals. The editor cites in his
margin a Belgic chronicle as a testimony.
(3) Sicard, bishop of Cremona. (4) M.
Paris. Roger Bacon, who flourished in
the middle of the thirteenth century, thus
speaks of the Crusade of Children: “<i>Forsan
vidistis aut audistis pro certo quod
pueri de regno Franciæ semel occurrebant
in infinita multitudine post quondam malignum
hominem, ita quod nec a patribus,
nec a matribus, nec amicis poterant detineri,
et positi sunt in navibus et Saracenis redditi, et non sunt adhuc 64 anni.</i>”
Honest Fuller says: “This crusade was done by the instinct of the devil,
who, as it were, desired a cordial of children’s blood, to comfort his weak
stomach, long cloyed with murdering of men.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5c3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5c">c</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A German Noble, Thirteenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>This expedition beyond the seas, undertaken about 1212, and composed
entirely of children, if not one of the most striking events of the Crusades,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
certainly appears not one of the least extraordinary. Whoever is acquainted
with the taste of the Middle Ages for the marvellous, and has only read the
incomplete account of the modern historians of the Crusades, is at first tempted
to range this expedition among fabulous adventures; and to procure it any
credit, it is necessary to produce evidences worthy of our confidence.</p>

<p>With regard to the date, contemporary historians all place this crusade
under the year 1212, or 1213 at the latest. It is only by an error very easy
to be reconciled, that others advance it twelve years, or put it back ten. As
to the places that witnessed the birth and growth of such an enterprise, it
appears that the crusaders belonged to two nations, and formed two troops,
which followed different routes; one, leaving Germany, traversed Saxony
and the Alps and arrived on the shores of the Adriatic Sea; France furnished
the others, who, after collecting in the environs of Paris, crossed
Burgundy, and arrived at Marseilles, the place of embarkation. Prestiges,
fanaticism, the announcement of prodigies, were all employed to rouse the
youth of these countries and put them in motion. It was reported, according
to Vincent de Beauvais, that the Old Man of the Mountain, who was
accustomed to educate <i>arsacides</i> from the tenderest age, detained two clerks
captives, and would only grant them their liberty upon condition that they
brought him back some young boys from France. The opinion then was,
that these children, deceived by false visions, and seduced by the promises
of these two clerks, marked themselves with the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>The promoter of the crusade in Germany was a certain Nicholas, a German
by nation. “This multitude of children,” says Bezarre, “were persuaded
by the help of a false revelation, that the drought would be so great that
year that the abysses of the sea would be dry; and they went to Genoa, with
the intention of passing over to Jerusalem, across the arid bed of the Mediterranean.”
The composition of these troops corresponded with the means
employed to seduce them. There were children of all ages and conditions,
and of both sexes; some of them were not more than twelve years old; they
set out from villages and towns, without leaders, without guides, without
provisions, and with empty purses. It was in vain their parents or friends
thought to dissuade them by showing them the folly of such an expedition;
the captivity to which they condemned them redoubled their ardour; breaking
through doors, or opening themselves passages through walls, they
succeeded in escaping, and went to rejoin their respective bands. If
they were questioned upon the object of their voyage, they answered that they
were going to visit the holy places. Although a pilgrimage commenced
under such auspices, and stained with all sorts of excesses, must have been
an object of scandal rather than of edification, there were people senseless
enough to see in it an act of the all-powerful God; men and women quitted
their houses and their lands to join these vagabond troops, believing they
pursued the way of salvation; others furnished them with money and food,
thinking they aided souls inspired by God, and guided by sentiments of
divine piety. The pope, when informed of their proceedings, exclaimed,
with a groan: “These children reproach us with being buried in sleep,
whilst they are flying to the defence of the Holy Land.” If some few of
the clergy, endowed with a little foresight, openly blamed this expedition,
their censures were at once attributed to motives of avarice and incredulity;
and, in order to avoid public contempt, wisdom and prudence were condemned
to silence.</p>

<p>The event, however, proved that all which man undertakes without
employing the balance of reason and earnest reflection, does not come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
a fortunate issue; “for soon,” says Bishop Sicard, “this multitude entirely
disappeared: <i>quasi evanuit universa</i>.” But we must carefully distinguish
between the fate of the German and that of the French crusaders, although
a part of the latter directed their course towards Italy. It required nothing
beyond wearing the cross to be admitted into the crusade; if the watchful
care of princes and prelates in expeditions directed by ecclesiastical and
secular power could not succeed in excluding from them men of bad morals,
what sort of people must have been mixed with a host got together without
the least care, and under the eye of no superior intelligence, the greater part
of whom fled, like the prodigal son, from the paternal dwelling, in order to
give themselves up, without restraint, to their vicious inclinations? The
account of Godfrey the Monk, therefore, does not at all astonish us when he
says that thieves insinuated themselves among the German pilgrims, and
disappeared after having plundered them of their baggage and the gifts the
faithful had bestowed upon them. One of these thieves, being recognised at
Cologne, ended his days on the rack.</p>

<p>To this first misfortune a crowd of evils quickly succeeded, the necessary
result of the want of foresight of the crusaders. The fatigue of a long journey,
heat, disease, and want, swept away a great number of them. Of those
who arrived in Italy, some, dispersing themselves over the country, and
plundered by the inhabitants, were reduced to servitude; others, to the
amount of seven thousand, presented themselves before Genoa. At first the
senate gave them permission to remain six or seven days in the city; but
reflecting afterwards upon the folly of the expedition, fearing that such a
multitude would produce famine, and, above all, apprehending that Frederick,
who was then in a state of rebellion against the holy see and at war
with Genoa, might take advantage of the circumstance to excite a tumult,
they ordered the crusaders to depart from the city. Some, finding their
error, turned back towards their own country again; and these crusaders,
who had been seen advancing in numerous troops, and singing animating
songs, returned singly, robbed of everything, walking barefooted, undergoing
the pangs of hunger, and subjected to the scoffs and derision of the
population of the cities and countries they passed through; it is not to be
wondered at, that in such circumstances many young girls lost the chastity
which had been their ornament in their homes.</p>

<p>The crusaders from France experienced a nearly similar fate; a very
slender portion of them returned; the rest either perished in the waves or
became an object of speculation for two Marseilles merchants. Hugh
Ferrers and William Porcus, so were they named, carried on a trade with
the Saracens, of which the sale of young boys formed a considerable branch.
No opportunity for an advantageous speculation could be more favourable;
they offered to transport to the East all the pilgrims who arrived at Marseilles,
without any kind of charge for the voyage; assigning piety as the
motive for this act of generosity. This proposition was joyfully accepted;
and seven vessels, laden with these pilgrims, set sail for the coast of Syria.
At the end of two days, when the ships were off the Isle of St. Peter, near
the Rock of the Recluse, a violent tempest arose, and the sea swallowed up
two of them, with all the passengers on board. The other five arrived at
Bougie and Alexandria, and the young crusaders were all sold to the Saracens
or to slave-merchants. The caliph bought forty of them, all of whom were
in orders, and caused them to be brought up with great care in a place set
apart for the purpose; twelve of the others perished as martyrs, being unwilling
to renounce their religion. None of the clerks purchased by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
caliph, according to the account of one of them who afterwards obtained his
liberty, embraced the worship of Mohammed; all faithful to the religion of
their fathers, practised it constantly in tears in slavery. Hugh and William,
having at a later period formed the project of assassinating Frederick, were
discovered, and perished in an ignominious manner, with three Saracens,
their accomplices, receiving, in this miserable end, the wages due to their
treachery.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory IX afterwards caused a church to be built in the island of
St. Peter, in honour of those who were shipwrecked, and instituted twelve
canonships to provide for the duties of it. In the time of Alberic the spot
was still pointed out where the bodies cast up by the waves were buried.
As for the crusaders who survived so many calamities, and remained in
Europe, with the exception of some old and infirm persons, the pope would
not release them from their vows; they were obliged either to perform the
pilgrimage at a maturer age, or to redeem it by alms.</p>

<p>Such was the issue of this crusade, so justly designated by two chronicles,
<i>expeditio nugatoria, expeditio derisoria</i>.</p>

<p>Two facts strike us as extraordinary in this account; the condition attached
by the Old Man of the Mountain to the liberty of the clerk of whom
Vincent de Beauvais speaks, and the trade in children carried on by the merchants
of Marseilles. Upon the first point we can offer nothing but the
opinion received among the nations of the West. It was generally believed
in the thirteenth century, that the Old Man of the Mountain kept up a connection
with Christian Europe; several princes were even accused of having
had recourse to the daggers of his Assassins to get rid of their enemies.
Frederick received ambassadors from him in Sicily. Roger Bacon complains
bitterly of the fascinations secretly employed by the Saracens to
seduce the young servants of Christ; the name of Assassins had already
passed into the vulgar tongue in the thirteenth century, and was the object
of general terror. In spite, then, of the opinion of some critics, a more extended
examination is necessary, before we reject the account of Vincent de
Beauvais. As to the trade in young boys, that is not at all a new fact;
many traces of it are found much anterior to this period. The Greeks and
Venetians practised it openly enough. Pope Zacharias repurchased, in 748,
many Christian slaves, who had been taken away from Rome by Venetian
merchants; the people of Verdun, as witnessed by Liutprand, were about to
sell to the Arabs of Spain some young boys they had mutilated, and who
were to serve as guards to the women of seraglios. Besides, the fate of the
young crusaders who embarked at Marseilles, and found degradation and
slavery instead of the sacred soil promised to their blind zeal, is attested by
two contemporary writers, worthy of perfect confidence: Thomas de Champré
and Roger Bacon.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5e"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>THE SIXTH CRUSADE (1217-1229 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1210-1215 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The successful heroism of the French adventurers before Constantinople
alarmed the Mussulmans, and Saphedin had gladly concluded a treaty
for six years’ peace with the Christians. Palestine soon again became the
theatre of ambition and of glory. Almeric and his wife died, and Mary,
the daughter of Isabella and Conrad of Tyre, was the new ideal queen of
Jerusalem, while Hugh de Lusignan, son of Almeric by his first wife, was
proclaimed king of Cyprus. Hugh had married the princess Alice, half
sister of the young queen, and daughter of Henry count of Champagne, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
Isabella. There was not at that time any nobleman of rule or influence in
Palestine capable of governing the state; and the ecclesiastical and civil
potentates resolved that Philip Augustus of France should provide a
husband for Mary. Philip Augustus fixed his eyes on Jean de Brienne,
son of the count of Brienne in Champagne. Though the sovereignty over
Jerusalem was titular, yet the command of the Christian army in Palestine,
and the possession of a young queen so desirable as the ambassadors painted
the daughter of Almeric, were circumstances so flattering to the imagination
of an aspiring cavalier, that Jean de Brienne received
the gift with joy; and the deputies were dismissed
with the promise that in two years he would join them
in Palestine with a powerful band. The truce of six
years was on the point of expiring, and Saphedin offered
to renew it, and to resign to the regency any ten castles
or towns they might select, to be retained by them in
perpetuity if the Saracens broke their faith. The
knights of St. John, and those of the Teutonic order,
argued strenuously for the acceptance of this offer;
but the spirit of party was always the enemy of Palestine,
and the Templars and clergy declared for war.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thirteenth Century Crusader</span></p>
</div>

<p>At the appointed time Jean de Brienne arrived
at Acre; the next day he received the hand of Mary,
and shortly afterward was crowned, and received the
oaths of allegiance of the barons. Only three hundred
knights had participated in his hopes of restoring
the fortunes of the Holy Land, for the enthusiasm
and love of glory of the western chivalry were diverted
into new channels. England and Germany
were torn by internal disturbances, the court of
France was watching the turn of events, and Pope
Innocent employed the penitents in putting an end
to the heresy of the Albigenses. The destroyers of
heretics and of infidels were alike praiseworthy; and
a crusade into the south of France was less dangerous
than a voyage to Syria. From these
various causes the Mussulmans in Asia were
forgotten or disregarded.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> As peace had been
refused, Saphedin marched an army to the
country round Tripolis. The king displayed
his valour in many a fierce encounter; and though he never conquered his
foes, yet he broke the impression of the enemy, and saved his states from
utter annihilation. He foresaw the approaching ruin of the holy cause;
every day the Saracens made some acquisition; and the Latin barons,
by every opportunity, and for every pretext, returned to Europe. He
wrote, therefore, to the pope that the kingdom of Jerusalem consisted only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
of two or three towns, and that the civil wars between the sons of Saladin
alone suspended its fate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1215-1217 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Every project of ambition which the daring genius of Gregory VII had
formed was embraced by the ardent spirit of Innocent III. In raising a
fabric of ecclesiastical policy on the ruins of gospel liberty, the importance of
guiding the military arm of Europe was not lost sight of. The commands of
the Vatican were hurled upon every part of Europe, calling men to exterminate
infidelity. The protection of St. Peter was promised to the families and
fortunes of the pilgrims. They who had bound themselves to pay usury were
released from their oaths; and secular power should compel the Jews to remit
their claims. The indulgences were revoked which had been granted to
those who quitted their homes in order to exterminate heresy in Provence,
and infidelity in Spain.</p>

<p>Among those who most loudly and successfully pleaded the cause of
religion was Robert de Courçon; a man inferior in talents and consideration
to St. Bernard, but whose fanaticism was as fervent as that of Peter
and Fulk. By parentage and birth he was an Englishman; but he had
been educated in the university of Paris, and in that famous seat of learning
had lived as a friend with a fellow student, who afterwards sat in the papal
chair, under the title of Pope Innocent III. The associate of his holiness
was promoted to various dignities in the church; his talents for business
were employed by Innocent in clerical embassies, and his abilities as a public
orator were matured under the care of Fulk de Neuilly. He was the papal
legate in France, and after having appeased the foreign and internal distractions
of that kingdom, he quitted Paris in 1215, descended by the way of
Burgundy to the southern provinces, left no quarter of the south unvisited;
and then, after having traversed with speed and success the western
provinces, the saint-errant returned to the capital. Twenty years before he
had preached the same theme to the same people, as the humble assistant of
Fulk. Clad in the Roman purple, and armed with the authority of the vicar
of Jesus Christ, the cardinal gave every possible dignity to the office of missionary.
But his prudence kept not pace with his zeal, for, like Peter the
Hermit, he admitted everyone to take the cross. Women, children, the old,
the blind, the lame, the lepers, all were enrolled in the sacred militia. The
multitude of the crusaders was innumerable, and the voluntary offerings of
money which was put into the charitable boxes in the churches were immense.
Philip Augustus contributed the fortieth part of his revenues; and it is singular
that this money was to be employed for purposes of the holy war, agreeably
to the directions of the kings and barons of France and England. But
the alms of the people of France were not applied exclusively to sacred purposes.
Robert de Courçon was openly convicted of peculation, and his papal
friend was obliged to remit his own dignity, and intercede with the French
prelates, in order to save the legate from punishment.</p>

<p>The pope, treading in the steps of his predecessors, convoked a general
council for the purpose of chastising vice, condemning heresy, and of inducing
the princes and people to undertake the sacred expedition. In the month
of November, 1215, the religious and political authorities assembled in the
church of the Lateran, and the greatness of their number, and their exalted
rank, testify the zealous preaching of the pope’s legates. All the clergy
(except those who were crusaders) were for three years to contribute
the twentieth part of their ecclesiastical revenues; tournaments during the
three years of the crusade were forbidden, lest the representation of war
should draw men’s attention from war itself. Civil dissensions were to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
suspended, and peace was to reign in the Christian world during all the time of
the holy contest.</p>

<p>The necessity of extirpating heresy, and quelling rebellion in the south
of France, was the pretence of the French king for not embracing the crusade.
The emperor Frederick II remained to establish his authority in
Apulia and Sicily, and to advance the favourite
project of himself and family, and of making Italy
the seat of the empire of the West.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The Hungarians
who had been the scourge of the first crusaders,
took the lead on this occasion. Their king, Andrew,
incited by the example of his mother Margaret, the
wish of his father, and certain political considerations,
made a vow to march to Jerusalem. The
dukes of Austria and Bavaria, and indeed all the
ecclesiastical and secular potentates of lower Germany,
joined their forces to those of the monarch.
The united army marched to Spalato. The ships
of Venice, and other ports of the Adriatic, transported
them to Cyprus; and after having enjoyed
for a while the pleasures of an island consecrated
to Venus, the holy warriors sailed for and arrived at
Acre, in company with fresh crowds of crusaders
from Marseilles, Genoa, and Brundusium. The
Mussulman powers were astonished at, and unprovided
for this sudden and large reinforcement of
the Latins. The sons of Saphedin were the lords
of Syria, while Saphedin himself, retired from the
constant toils of royalty, was contented with the respect
of the army and people in times of difficulty
and danger. The Saracens pressed to the country
about Nablus, but not in sufficient numbers to
meet the new crusaders, who ravaged the country
and slew thousands of their foes. But they did not
confine their cruelties to the infidels. The soil of
Palestine, in the year in which the present crusaders
landed, had been less productive than in
most seasons; the soldiers had carried thither no provisions, and when not
engaged in distant excursions into the enemy’s territories, they took the
shorter course of robbing the private and religious houses of the Latins
and Syrians.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

</div>

<div class="sidenote">[1217-1219 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Pious exercises, however, re-established order. The ecclesiastical chief of
the Latin Christians led the army in religious procession across the river
of Kishon, to the valley of Jezreel. They bathed in the Jordan, made their
pilgrimage to the Lake of Gennesaret, observed with devout awe the scenes of
various miracles performed by Christ, and returned to Acre. But they soon
repaired their wasted strength, and trod with holy reverence the road to the
scene of the transfiguration. The ascent to Mount Tabor, however, was
difficult; and the summit was defended by a strongly garrisoned tower.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
Attached as much to pilgrimages as to war, the crusaders went in holy order
to Tyre and Sidon; but the inclemency of the season drove them into disorder,
and the Saracens made dreadful havoc on their divided parties.
The Christians separated for the remainder of the winter. The kings of
Cyprus and Hungary repaired to Tripolis; and if the people were grieved
at the death of the former of these princes, their feelings were quickly changed
into indignation against the latter. Neither the entreaties nor the threats
of the clergy could persuade the unstable Andrew to remain in Palestine.
Taking with him most of his soldiers and stores, he traversed Armenia and
the Greek Empire, and at last returned to his kingdom, which had been so
deeply exhausted by this expensive expedition, that it did not for years
recover its pristine strength.</p>

<p>The king of Jerusalem, the duke of Austria, and the master of the Hospitallers,
took up a strong position on the plains of Cæsarea. The Templars,
the Teutonic knights, and Walter d’Avesnes, occupied Mount Carmel, and
their station was defended by a tower which the Templars had formerly
erected, for the defence and protection of the Jerusalem pilgrims. In the
spring of the following year they were joined by new and zealous crusaders
from the north of Germany. Cologne had been the rendezvous, and nearly
three hundred vessels sailed from the Rhine. Many of the ships were
wrecked by the violence of the autumnal winds, and the remainder anchored
off the Portuguese shore. By the aid of the Germans, the queen of Portugal
took Alcacer from the Moors. Conscience and valour would be equally satisfied
by the slaughter of Saracens, in whatever country they might be.
As soon as the Cologne reinforcements arrived, the chiefs assembled in
council, and it was agreed that siege should be laid to Damietta, which was
looked upon as the key of Egypt. A voyage of a few days brought the
Christian army within sight of Damietta. The catapults and ballistæ shook
the walls of the citadel to their foundations, and the garrison was happy in
surrendering to the discretion of the besiegers.</p>

<p>Before the joy of the Christians had subsided, news arrived of the death
of Saphedin. The power of his house had lately been strengthened by
the death of the sultan of Mosul, the last great supporter of the name of the
atabegs. But Saphedin did not live to complete the addition of all Mosul to
his empire of Damascus and Egypt. The brother of Saladin has been variously
represented, according to the different feelings with which he was regarded.
But the crusaders had such a limited knowledge of oriental affairs,
that their invectives cannot be opposed to the reputation which he acquired
for virtue and ability. His second son, Coradin, the prince of Syria and
Palestine, did not proclaim the death of his father till he had secured himself
in the possession of the royal coffers. Discord and rebellion were universal
throughout Egypt, when the news arrived of the death of Saphedin; and his
son Kamil, lord of that country, was compelled to fly into Arabia for protection
from his mutinous people.</p>

<p>After the surrender of the castle of Damietta, the acquisition of the
city appeared so easy an achievement, that the besieging army sunk into
inertness and dissoluteness. The sultan of Syria had anticipated the fall of
Damietta, the sultan of Egypt despaired of its defence, and no wisdom could
calculate the magnitude of the effects which its capture might produce.
Prudence suggested the policy of negotiation, and the Latins were therefore
offered the piece of the true cross, the city of Jerusalem, and all the prisoners
in Syria and Egypt. The Mussulmans were to rebuild the walls of the
sacred city. Of the whole kingdom of Palestine they only proposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
retain the castles of Karak and Montreal, as necessary for the safe passage
of the Meccan pilgrims and merchants. The evacuation of Egypt was the
equivalent expected from the Christians for these important concessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1219-1220 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>All the legitimate consequences of the Crusades were at the command of
the soldiers of the cross. The king, the French, the earl of Chester, and the
Teutonic knights hailed with joy the prospect of the termination of the war.
But the legate, the bishops, the Italians, the Templars, and Hospitallers were
deaf to counsels of moderation. They contended that no faith could be
reposed upon the promises of infidels, unless peace was made at the point of
a victorious sword. The siege had already lasted seventeen months, and
it would be disgraceful to fly from the fair prospect of success. Unhappily
for the general interests of the Christian cause, the mild suggestions of
policy were disregarded amidst the clamours of thoughtless valour. Hostilities
were recommenced. The besiegers interrupted all communication
between the Egyptian army and the garrison of Damietta. Resistance was
fruitless, but the Mussulmans were too brave and too proud to surrender.
The legate and the king assaulted the walls, and soon entered the city, with
the same ruthless feelings as had maddened the early crusaders, when they
first leaped on the battlements of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>But revenge sought its victims in vain. Damietta was one vast charnel-house.
Of a population, which at the beginning of the siege consisted of
more than seventy thousand souls, three thousand only were the relics.
The conquerors marched through a pestilential vapour. The streets, the
mosques, and the houses were strewn with dead bodies. From scenes of
death the Christians turned to plunder. Damietta was as rich a city as
any in Islam, and the terrible anathemas of the legate could not prevent
self-appropriation of spoil. Dominion over the place was given to the king
of Jerusalem. The splendid mosque was converted into a Christian church,
and dedicated to the Virgin and all the apostles. But the soldiers were soon
compelled to return to the camp, for pestilence was in the city. Life
and liberty were granted to the surviving Mussulmans, on their performing
the horrid and melancholy task of cleansing the city from the remains of
their relations and friends.</p>

<p>So great was the terror which the loss of Damietta spread among the
Mussulmans, that the fortress of Tanis surrendered. By this acquisition,
the way into Palestine was open. But instead of urging their advantages,
the army passed the winter in luxury and in discord, and in the spring
more than half of the soldiers returned to Europe. The power of the
legate was supreme, and the king of Jerusalem retired in disgust to Acre.
The duke of Bavaria, and many knights from Germany and Italy, arrived,
as soon as the weather would permit the passage; but they disdained to
submit to the command of a bishop, and Pelagius was compelled to solicit
with humility the return of the king. Jean de Brienne repaired to Damietta,
and a council was held on the subject of hostile operations. The conquest
of Egypt was resolved upon, and the army marched by the eastern
side of the Fatimite branch of the Nile, till their progress was arrested by
the canal of Ashmun. On the southern side of that canal the Mussulman
forces were posted. Every sultan of Syria had sent assistance to their
brother in the faith, and the allied troops under Kamil could cope with
the Latins in the field.</p>

<p>The sultan, however, would not trust his kingdom to the caprice of fortune.
He offered peace to the Christians on nearly the same terms as those
which had been proposed previously to the last assault on Damietta. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
legate refused with indignation these noble offers; but instead of crossing
the canal and giving the enemy battle, he remained for more than a month
inactive on his post expecting the unconditional surrender of the sultan.
During this time the Nile had rapidly increased in height. The Mussulmans
opened the sluices and inundated their enemy’s camp. The
Christians could neither advance nor retreat; and, to use the humble
simile of a Templar, they were enclosed like a fish in a net. When the overflowings
of the Nile had swept away all the tents and baggage, Pelagius sent
an embassy to the Mussulman camp, imploring a safe return to Acre, and
offering to surrender Damietta and Tanis to the Mussulmans. The distress
of the Christian army was mitigated by the humanity of Kamil. The king of
Jerusalem was one of the hostages, and in an interview with the sultan,
he wept for the miserable state of his army. “Why do you weep?” inquired
the sultan. “I have reason to weep,” replied the king, “for the
people whom God has given into my charge, are perishing in the midst of the
waters, or dying of hunger.” The sultan shed tears of pity, and opened
the Egyptian granaries for their relief. When, after eight months’ possession
by the Latins, Damietta was delivered into the power of the Mussulmans, the
hostages were exchanged, and the Christian army retreated to the seacoast,
through the road by which they had advanced in full confidence of victory.
The barons of Syria, and the military orders, retired to Acre; and the
volunteers returned to Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1220-1227 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The pope cast all the odium on the emperor Frederick, a man who had
thrice sworn to redeem the Holy Land, and had compromised with his conscience
by merely sending soldiers and provisions. Frederick despised the
thunders of the Vatican; but although he was not awed by force, he could
not resist papal artifice. Honorius soothed his irritated mind, and received
him again as a faithful son of the church. Hermann von Salza, master of the
Teutonic order, returned to Europe, and gave the emperor the hope of being
the redeemer of Palestine. Yolande, the daughter of the king of Jerusalem,
could easily be obtained in marriage, and her father would cede his rights,
which he was wearied of endeavouring to convert into an actual and firm
dominion. The emperor and the pope approved of this project. Frederick
accepted from the king of Jerusalem a renunciation of all his claims to
the Holy Land, as the dowry of Yolande; and he pledged his honour to the
pope, the cardinals, and the masters of the Hospitallers and Teutonic
knights, that he would within two years travel with a powerful army into
the East, and re-establish the throne of Godfrey de Bouillon. For the succeeding
five years, rebellions in Italy, and the insurrections of the Saracens
in Sicily, detained the emperor from his purpose. Honorius did not live to
witness the event of his exertions, but his successor, Gregory IX, was equally
furious in the cause.</p>

<p>At the time appointed for the sailing of the expedition, Brundusium
and its vicinity were crowded with soldiers. But the heats of summer destroyed
the health of the people of the north; thousands died, and of those
who endeavoured to return to their homes, the greatest part perished through
poverty or disease. Although the emperor did not escape the common illness,
yet he embarked at Brundusium. But after sailing for three days,
additional infirmity compelled him to return. Gregory inherited the papal
virtues of violence and ambition; he pronounced a sentence of excommunication
against the emperor, for declining to combat the enemy of God.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1227-1229 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The thunders of the Vatican rolled again and again over the head of
the emperor, but the author of them suffered more than the object. The
emperor sent troops into the papal territories, who ravaged the march of
Ancona, and the patrimony of St. Peter. Such of the Hospitallers and
Templars (the firm friends of the pope) as had estates in the imperial dominions
in Italy, were plundered and dispossessed.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The emperor heavily taxed
his subjects, both churchmen and laity, for the expenses of the holy war. In
defiance of Gregory’s warnings against his entering on the crusade, till he
should be relieved from the censures of the church, Frederick embarked at
Brundusium in August, 1228, and arrived shortly afterwards at Acre. The
joy of the Christians at the arrival of the emperor was soon checked by letters
which the patriarch received from the pope, prohibiting the faithful from
obeying a rebellious son of the church. The Teutonic knights feared no
clerical censures; and at their head, and of some other soldiers, the emperor
quitted Acre, went to Joppa, and repaired the fortifications of that important
city. He then made further advances towards Jerusalem.</p>

<p>While matters were in this state, news was brought to the emperor of an
effectual method which the pope had taken of preventing him from continuing
the war in Palestine with the enemies of Christ. The pope’s troops,
of whom Jean de Brienne (the father-in-law of Frederick) was one of the
chief commanders, burned the imperial towns in Italy, imprisoned, tortured,
and robbed the people. The duke of Spalato, the emperor’s lieutenant, had
been unable successfully to resist, though the imperial army had been but
little impaired by Frederick’s foreign expedition. These circumstances made
the emperor anxious to return to Europe; a treaty was immediately signed.
For ten years the Christians and Mussulmans were to live upon terms of
brotherhood. Jerusalem, Joppa, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and their appendages,
were restored to the Christians. The Holy Sepulchre likewise was given to
them; and the people of both religions might offer up their prayers in the
place of devotion, which the former class called the temple of Solomon, and
the latter named the mosque of Omar. The address of Frederick more
effectually promoted the object of the holy wars than the heroic frenzy of
Richard; many of the disasters consequent on the battle of Tiberias were
wiped away, and the serious and habitual hopes of Europe, for a permanent
settlement in Asia, seemed to be realised. But the barons of the Holy
Land, breathing interminable war, and secretly envying superior genius,
avowed indignation that a Christian sovereign should accept the friendship of
the infidels. The patriarch and clergy hated an excommunicated prince;
a man too who had given licence to the Saracens to adore their God in
a Christian temple. With some appearance of reason, however, they contended
that the treaty was not binding on the Mussulmans while the
approbation of the sultan of Damascus was withheld. But, despising the
blood-thirstiness of the barons, and the cruel bigotry of the priests, Frederick
asserted his royal prerogatives; and, as he had acquired some of the
old possessions of the Bouillon family, he avowed his intention of having
the crown placed upon his head in the Holy City agreeably to constitutional
forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span></p>

<p>Some persons, discontented with the conditions of the treaty, wished to
betray him into the hands of the sultan of Egypt. The guilt of this treachery
lies between the Hospitallers and the Templars. Kamil read the letter which
conveyed to him the news, exclaimed to his associates, “See the fidelity of
these Christian dogs”; and despatched a friend to Frederick with the
paper which he had received. The emperor repaired to Jerusalem; but no
hosannas welcomed his approach. By the command of the patriarch no religious
ceremonies were performed in the churches during his stay. Even
the German prelates preferred their spiritual to their temporal allegiance;
and the emperor, accompanied only by his courtiers and the Teutonic
knights, went to the church of the sepulchre. He boldly took the crown
from the altar, and placed it on his own head, and Hermann von Salza pronounced
a laudatory oration. Orders were then given for the restoration
of the city’s walls, and the emperor returned to Acre. In that city too there
was every demonstration of sorrow at his appearance. Mass was performed
in secret; the churches were deprived of their ornaments; the bells were
not rung, and the dead were interred without any religious ceremony. But
by some well-measured acts of severity, a semblance of respect was at length
shown to the emperor; and he then returned to Europe, leaving the priests
and people to thank Heaven for his departure.</p>

<p>Few parts of the Crusades are more difficult to understand, and to reduce
into a clear and intelligible form, than the expedition of Frederick. He was
vilified by the Templars and Hospitallers, and other friends of the pope;
and their narratives of events are more numerous than those of the imperial
party. He gained more for the Christians than any prince had acquired
since the first establishment of the kingdom; and if the pope had not hated
him worse than his holiness hated the Saracens, and thereby caused his
return to Europe, there is every probability that after the death of the sultan
of Damascus, the emperor would have brought matters to an issue completely
triumphant. Gregory IX and his clergy had the effrontery to tell the world
that Frederick had left the sepulchre of Christ in the hands of the infidels.
But the fact was that it was given to the Christians. The temple of Solomon
indeed, or rather the mosque of Omar, was left in the hands of the Mussulmans;
a right of visiting it, however, being allowed to the Christians.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_5c4"><a href="#crusades_endnote_5c">c</a></span></p>

a great number of crusaders, whom he sent against the Albigenses in France. These were

knowing no other way to bring home a wandering sheep than by worrying him to death. He
freely and fully promised the undertakers the self-same pardons and indulgences as he did to
those who went to conquer the Holy Land; and very conscionably requested their aid only for
forty days, hoping to chop up these Albigenses at a bit. The place being nearer, the service

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The poet, As-Sahib Jemal ad-Din ben Matrub made the following
verses on the failure of Saint Louis’ Crusade, his capture and ransom:</p>

<p>“Bear to the king of France, when you shall see him, these words,
traced by a partisan of truth: The death of the servants of the Messiah
has been the reward given to you by God.</p>

<p>“You have landed in Egypt, thinking to take possession of it. You
have imagined that it was only peopled with cowards! you who are a
drum filled with wind.</p>

<p>“You thought that the moment to destroy the Mussulmans was
arrived; and this false idea has smoothed, in your eyes, every difficulty.</p>

<p>“By your excellent conduct, you have abandoned your soldiers on
the plains of Egypt, and the tomb has gaped under their feet.</p>

<p>“What now remains of the seventy thousand who accompanied
you? Dead, wounded, and prisoners!</p>

<p>“May God inspire you often with similar designs! They will
cause the ruin of all Christians, and Egypt will have no longer to
dread anything from their rage.</p>

<p>“Without doubt your priests announced victories to you; their
predictions were false.</p>

<p>“Refer yourselves to a more enlightened oracle.</p>

<p>“Should the desire of revenge urge you to return to Egypt, be assured
the house of Lokman still remains, that the chain is ready prepared,

<p>The council of Spoleto decreed that fresh levies should be sent into Asia
on the expiration of the truce with Kamil. The Franciscans and Dominicans
were the bearers of the resolutions to the princes and people of Christendom.
But it was soon apparent that the recovery of the Holy Land was
not the paramount consideration in the mind of Gregory IX, for the preaching
of the crusade once more became the means of filling the papal coffers.
By the different engines of persuasion and compulsion, the missionaries
gained numberless converts, and then allowed the unwilling, and compelled
the wealthy crusaders to give the church great largesses in exchange for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
vow. The once humble friars grew so rich by these exactions, that their
pride and magnificence were detestable in the eyes of the people. These disgraceful
scenes were acted in England for two years; but the indignation
of society at the avarice of the pope was so strong, that the preaching ceased.
Some of the English nobility were inflamed by the love of warlike praise,
and took the cross with no intention of submitting to a pecuniary commutation.
The earl of Chester, and also Richard, earl of Cornwall, brother to
King Henry II, prepared to measure lances with the Saracens.</p>

<h5>RICHARD OF CORNWALL’S CRUSADE (THE SEVENTH)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1236-1240 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The desire of crusading was influenced by events in Palestine. A truce
between the sultan of Aleppo and the Templars expired with the life of the
Mussulman prince; and when his successor renewed the war with them, they
sustained so severe a defeat, that every commandery in Europe sent them
succours; and even the Hospitallers resolved to avenge the death of their
rivals. Three hundred knights and a considerable body of stipendiaries
went from London.</p>

<p>The spirit of crusading burned in France, particularly in the middle and
southern provinces; and many barons assembled at Lyons in order to concert
the means of giving effect to their common desire. But a legate of the pope
interrupted their councils with announcing the commands of his master for
the dissolving of the assembly, and the return of the members to their homes.
The barons remonstrated against this versatility of opinion in an infallible
guide. The nuncio was contumeliously dismissed. Most of the nobility
pressed forwards to Marseilles, and hoisted sail for the Holy Land. Indignant
at their contempt of his wishes, the emperor prohibited the governors of
Apulia and other countries from affording aid to the crusaders. This measure
prevented many parties of cavaliers from pursuing the voyage; but it did not
impede those fanatical and romantic warriors, the king of Navarre, the duke
of Burgundy, and the counts of Bar and Brittany, from continuing their
course to Acre.</p>

<p>News of the warlike preparations of Europe had been communicated to
the sultan of Egypt; and the first moment when the faith of treaties opposed
not a hostile course, he drove the Latins out of Jerusalem, and overthrew the
tower of David, which, until that time, had always been regarded as sacred
by all classes of religionists. After this capture Kamil died; various princes
of Syria and Egypt asserted their pretensions to the vacant throne; but the
military spirit was too active among the Mussulmans, to allow the Christians
rationally to hope that they should eventually profit by these dissensions.
The war began by a successful irruption of the count of Brittany into the
Damascene territories. But in the vicinity of Gaza three hundred Frenchmen,
who wished to imitate the glory of the cavaliers of Brittany, were
defeated by a smaller number of Turks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1240-1244 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The pope renewed his endeavours to persuade the English to commute
their piety for gold, but his ministers, the Franciscans and Dominicans, were
treated only with contempt; and in the spring of the year 1240, Richard,
earl of Cornwall, William Longespee or Longsword, Theodore, the prior of
the Hospitallers, and many others of the nobility, embarked at Dover. The
arrival of Richard and the other barons at Acre, took place shortly after the
signature of the discordant treaties between the Templars and the emir of
Karak, and the Hospitallers with the sultan of Egypt. The English were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
astonished to find that the king of Navarre and the count of Brittany had
fled from the plains of Syria, when they received intelligence of the departure
of reinforcements from Europe. The emir of Karak, too, could not fulfil
his treaty, or even restore to the Templars the prisoners which had been
made in the battle of Gaza. Richard marched to Joppa, but as the sultan of
Egypt (then at war with the sultan of Damascus) sent to offer him terms
of peace, he prudently seized the benefits of negotiation. With the consent of
the duke of Burgundy, the master of the Hospitallers, and other lords of high
degree, he accepted a renunciation of Jerusalem, Berytus, Nazareth, Bethlehem,
Mount Tabor, and most of the Holy Land. An exchange of prisoners
was to cement the union. The great object of the crusaders seemed now to
be accomplished. Palestine belonged to the Christians. Richard returned
to Europe, and was received in every town as the deliverer of the Holy Sepulchre.
From neglect or inability he had not induced the Templars to consent
to his completion of the hopes of the West; and in spleen and revenge the
cavaliers renewed those unfraternal altercations with other knights which
had hastened the ruin of the kingdom in the time of Saladin (1241).</p>

<p>The Hospitallers opened their treasury for the re-edification of the walls
of Jerusalem. The patriarch and clergy entered the sacred city, and reconsecrated
the churches. For two years Christianity was the only religion
administered in Jerusalem, and the faithful began to exult in the apparent
permanent downfall of infidelity, when a new enemy arose more dreadful
than even the Mussulmans.</p>

<h5>THE TATAR CREVASSE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1244 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The great Tatarian princes, Jenghiz Khan and his successors, had obliterated
the vast empire of Khwarizm; and the expelled and defeated Tatars
fled to the south. The storm rolled on towards Egypt, the Khwarizmians
demanded a settlement; the sultan was the only Moslem prince who entered
into treaties with those barbarians; and he advised them to fix themselves
in Palestine. He sent one of his principal emirs, and a large body of troops
as their guides and coadjutors, and at the head of twenty thousand horse, Barbacan,
the Khwarizmian general entered the Holy Land. The Christians in
Jerusalem heard with dismay that the Tatarian tempest had reached their
territories. It was evident from the ruined state of the walls that Jerusalem
was no longer tenable. The cavaliers, and many of the inhabitants,
abandoned the sacred city.</p>

<p>The Khwarizmians entered it, spared neither lives nor property, and
violated both Christian and Mussulman sanctuaries. In the wantonness of
cruelty they disinterred the departed great, and made a cremation of venerable
remains. The insulting fanatics of savageness murdered priests round the
altars, exclaiming while they stabbed the holy men, “Let us pour their blood
on the place where they poured out wine in commemoration of their crucified
God.” As crafty as ferocious, they planted a banner of the cross upon the
walls, and, deceived by this joyful appearance, several thousands of the fugitives
returned to the city, but only to partake of the miserable doom of
their friends.</p>

<p>The repeated solicitations of the Templars at length brought four thousand
soldiers from their Syrian allies. The united Christian and Mussulman
forces were so far inferior to the Tatars, that policy required a course
of measures perfectly defensive. But the fury of the patriarch precipitated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
the army into the gulf of destruction. The awful conflict raged for two
days. The soldiers of Damascus and Emesa were soon slain, or scattered.
The loss of every part of the army was great, almost beyond example.
Only sixteen Hospitallers, thirty-three Templars, and three Teutonic cavaliers
remained alive and free. These soldiers fled to Acre, and that city
became the refuge of the Christians. After having razed the fortifications
of Askalon, and the castle of Tiberias, the Khwarizmians and Egyptians
encamped on the plains of Acre, devastated the country, and slew or led
into captivity all straggling Franks.</p>

<p>A united force of Khwarizmians and mamelukes conquered Damascus,
and Europe heard with dismay that the Mussulman power was again consolidating.
But the members soon were separated,
for the sultan of Egypt, faithless as cruel, denied his
allies a permanent settlement on the shores of the
Nile. The soldiers of fortune flew to the banner of
the Damascene prince, and assisted him in his efforts
to recover his capital. But the cause of the mamelukes
was felt as the common interest of the Moslem
world, and all Syria, as well as all Egypt, was in
arms in order to exterminate the northern barbarians.
In a general engagement the Khwarizmians were
defeated and scattered. Barbacan was slain, and
southern Asia recovered from its panic and distress.</p>

<h5>THE CRUSADE OF ST. LOUIS (THE EIGHTH)</h5>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Tatar</span></p>
</div>

<p>The superstition of a French king, and the
successes of the savage Khwarizmians, gave birth
to the Eighth Crusade. Pope Innocent IV convoked
a general council at Lyons; the Bishop of
Berytus described the effects of the Tatarian storm,
and left his ecclesiastical brethren to conclude,
whether one effort should not be made for a restoration
of things to the state in which Richard, earl
of Cornwall, had left them. It was accordingly
resolved that a crusade should be preached throughout
Christendom, and that for four years peace and
seriousness should reign over Europe. Such of the
faithful as did not expose their persons in the holy
cause were to give the subsidiary aid of treasure;
and the contribution to be made by the cardinals was fixed at a tenth, and
that of the other ecclesiastics at a twentieth part of their yearly revenues.</p>

<p>The pope wrote to Henry III, king of England, urging him to press on
his subjects the necessity of punishing the Khwarizmians. But the spirit of
crusading raged more strongly in France than in any other country of the
West; and it revived in all its fierceness of piety and chivalry in Louis IX.
Agreeably to the temper of the times, he had vowed, whilst afflicted by a
severe illness, that in case of recovery he would travel to the Holy Land. In
the delirium of his fever, he had beheld an engagement between the Christians
and the Saracens; the infidels were victorious, and the brave king of a valiant
nation fancied it his duty to avenge the defeat. The victories of the
Khwarizmians were a realisation of part of his dream, and his preparations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
had anticipated the decrees of the Lyonese council. This vow was made
about the year 1244, according to Nangis and Chronicle of St. Denis, cited
in Du Cange’s notes. From the moment of his resolving to go to the Holy
Land, St. Louis quitted all pomp of dress; he exchanged his purple for
black, a royal for a religious habit. During the crusade he abstained from
wearing scarlet, vair, or ermine. The example of the monarch gave efficacy
to the laws regarding simplicity of dress, and the lord of Joinville assures us,
that, during the whole time he was attending the king on his crusade, he never
once saw an embroidered coat of arms. The French barons, however, when
resident in Damietta, were less rigid in morality than in dress. The cross was
likewise taken by the three royal brothers, the counts of Artois, Poitiers,
and Anjou, by the duke of Burgundy, the countess of Flanders, and her two
sons, the count of St. Paul, and many other knights.</p>

<p>Sentiments of respect for the king of France were not felt in his country
alone; the people of England revered his name, and avowedly in imitation
of his example, the bishop of Salisbury, William Longespee, Walter de Lucy,
and many other English nobles and gentlemen were crossed. William Longespee
was, or feigned himself, poor, and went to Rome to solicit the aid of the
pope. He returned to England, and extorted more than a thousand marks
from the religious, while the less scrupulous or more powerful earl of Cornwall
was insatiable in his avarice, and gained from one archdeacon alone, six
hundred pounds. Political circumstances detained St. Louis in France for
three years; but the money and troops which he sent to the Holy Land
invigorated the hopes of the Latin Christians. The ranks of the military
orders were recruited by hired troops and regular knights from the different
stations in Europe.</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, 1248, Louis, attended by his three brothers, went
to the abbey of St. Denis, and received from the pope’s legate the oriflamme,
the alms’ purse, and pilgrim’s staff. He sailed from France at the end of
August, and arrived in September at Cyprus, the appointed rendezvous for
his barons and their vassals. The king remained eight months in Cyprus,
employed in organising his troops, in works of piety, and particularly in healing
the breaches in charity between the military orders. The Venetians and
other people assisted the French with provisions; on one occasion the supplies
of the emperor Frederick preserved the army, and the grateful king implored
the pope to absolve a man who had been benevolent to the soldiers of the
church. The ambassadors of a Tatarian prince appeared before Louis, offering
their master’s aid to root the Saracens and pagans out of the Holy Land.
The king sent a magnificent present to his ally, in order to bribe him to become
a Christian. Two black monks, who understood the Arabic language, were
charged with the missionary office, and their eloquence and embroidered
representation of some of the mysteries of Christianity were to effect the conversion
of the Scythian savage and his court. In the spring of the year 1249,
the soldiers of Louis were mustered, and his ships prepared for sea; fifty
thousand men formed his military force, and eighteen hundred was the number
of his transports, palendars, and store ships. They set sail for Egypt;
a storm separated the fleet, and the royal division, in which were nearly
three thousand knights and their men-at-arms, arrived off Damietta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1249 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The shores were lined by the sultan’s troops, who astonished the French
by the clangour of trumpets and brazen drums. The heralds of the king of
France instantly went to the sultan, Nejm ad-Din (a son of Kamil), near
Ashmun, and spared no language of exaggeration in describing the power
of their master. The only way to avoid the tempest was to receive priests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
who would teach the Christian religion to the people of Egypt:<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> otherwise
he would pursue them everywhere, and God should decide to whom the
country should be given. The sultan replied that he also knew the use of
arms, and like the French, inherited valour. The cause of the Mussulmans
was that of justice; and the <i>Koran</i> declared, that they who made war
unjustly should perish.</p>

<p>Some of the knights wished to dissuade the king from landing, till the
appearance of their brethren in arms; but on the second day after their
arrival, Louis commanded the disembarkation; he himself leaped into the
water; his shield was suspended from his neck, his helmet was on his head,
and his lance on his wrist. His soldiers followed him to the shore; and the
Saracens, panic-struck at their boldness and determination, made but a slight
show of defence, and fled into the interior of the country. Although
Damietta was better prepared for a siege than in those days when it had
sustained an attack of eighteen months’ duration, yet the garrison sought
safety in the fleetness of their horses. They were received at Cairo with
the indignation which their cowardice merited; and the sultan (who had
repaired thither from Ashmun) strangled fifty of the chiefs. The people of
Damietta loaded themselves with their most valuable effects, set fire to the
part of the city in which their merchandise and plunder were collected, and
then took flight for Cairo. Louis fixed his residence in the city; a Christian
government was established; and the clergy, agreeably to old custom,
purified the mosques. According to ancient usage, one-third part of the
spoil should have been allotted to the general-in-chief, and the remaining
portions had been usually divided among the pilgrims; but, at the suggestion
of the patriarch of Jerusalem, Louis ordered that the corn and provisions
should form a magazine for the common benefit of the army; and he
retained to himself the rest of the movable booty.</p>

<p>Neither the religious character of the war, nor the importance of preserving
military discipline, had any effect on the conduct of the holy warriors.
So general was the immorality, that the king could not stop the foul and noxious
torrent. The hope of the reward of a piece of gold for an enemy’s head,
inspirited the Mussulmans to many enterprises of difficulty and danger;
but Louis prevented at length their incursions into his camp, for he surrounded
it with deep ditches, and his cross-bowmen galled the approaching
parties of Mussulman cavalry. The French looked with impatience for
the count of Poitiers and the arrière-ban of France, the remainder of the force
which had sailed from Cyprus, and had been driven to Acre in the tempest.
In October 1249 the count of Poitiers reached Egypt. The French also
were joined by two hundred English knights.</p>

<h5>THE BATTLE OF MANSURA</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1250 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At the close of November, the army commenced its march to the capital
of Egypt. Until their approach to the vicinity of Mansura, they overcame
the open and insidious enmity of the Saracens. Soon after his departure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
from Damietta, the king accepted the proffered aid of five hundred horsemen
of the sultan, and commanded his army to respect their guides. Vainly
thinking that this order was inflexible to circumstances, the Saracens
attacked the Templars, who formed the van of the army. But the valiant
knights rallied round their grand master, and invoking God to aid them in
this perilous conjuncture, they rushed upon and destroyed their treacherous
foes. Fakhr ad-Din, the Egyptian emir, and his army were encamped on the
opposite side of the Ashmun canal, which the French in vain endeavoured
to cross. They commenced a causeway over the canal; but the Saracens
ruined in a day the work of a month; and even crossed the Nile by one of
the passages which were familiar to them and gave battle to the enemy.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6b1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6b">b</a></span></p>

<p>It is so hard for the layman to get a true idea of the chaos and disintegrated
nature of a battle, that a realistic account of how St. Louis fought
the Saracens is well worth quoting, especially from the pen of the lord of
Joinville whose sword was busy in these very scenes.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>DE JOINVILLE’S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF MANSURA</h5>

<p>A Bedouin had lately come to say that if we would give him five hundred
golden besants, he would show a safe ford, which might easily be crossed on
horseback. The day appointed for this purpose was Shrove-Tuesday, which,
when arrived, we all mounted our horses, and armed at all points, followed
the Bedouin to the ford. On our way thither, some advanced too near the
banks of the river, which being soft and slippery, they and their horses
fell in and were drowned. The king seeing it, pointed it out to the rest,
that they might be more careful and avoid similar danger. Among those that
were drowned was that valiant knight Sir John d’Orleans, who bore the
banner of the army. When we came to the ford, we saw on the opposite
bank full three hundred Saracen cavalry ready to defend this passage. We
entered the river, and our horses found a tolerable ford with firm footing,
so that by ascending the stream we found an easy shore, and through God’s
mercy we all crossed over with safety. The Saracens, observing us thus cross,
fled away with the utmost despatch.</p>

<p>Before we set out, the king had ordered that the Templars should form
the van, and the count d’Artois his brother should command the second
division of the army; but the moment the count d’Artois had passed the
ford with all his people, and saw the Saracens flying, they stuck spurs into
their horses and galloped after them; for which those who formed the van
were much angered at the count d’Artois, who could not make any answer,
on account of Sir Foucquault du Melle, who held the bridle of his horse;
and Sir Foucquault, being deaf, heard nothing the Templars were saying to
the count d’Artois, but kept bawling out, “Forward, forward!” When the
Templars perceived this, they thought they should be dishonoured if they allowed
the count d’Artois thus to take the lead, and with one accord they
spurred their horses to their fastest speed, pursuing the Saracens through
the town of Mansura, as far as the plains before Babylon; but on their
return the Turks shot at them plenty of arrows and other artillery, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
repassed through the narrow streets of the town. The count d’Artois and
the lord de Coucy, of the name of Raoul, were there slain, and as many as
three hundred other<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> knights. The Templars lost, as their chief informed
me, full fourteen score men at arms and horses. My knights, as well as
myself, noticing on our left a large body of Turks who were arming, instantly
charged them; and when we were advanced into the midst of them,
I perceived a sturdy Saracen mounting his horse, which was held by one of
his esquires by the bridle, and while he was putting his hand on the saddle
to mount, I gave him such a thrust with my spear, which I pushed as far as
I was able, that he fell down dead. The esquire, seeing his lord dead, abandoned
master and horse; but, watching my motions, on my return struck
me with his lance such a blow between the shoulders as drove me on my
horse’s neck, and held me there so tightly that I could not draw my sword,
which was girthed round me. I was forced to draw another sword which
was at the pommel of my saddle, and it was high time; but, when he saw I
had my sword in my hand, he withdrew his lance which I had seized and ran
from me.</p>

<p>It chanced that I and my knights had traversed the army of the Saracens,
and saw here and there different parties of them, to the amount of
about six thousand, who, abandoning their quarters, had advanced into the
plain. On perceiving that we were separated from the main body, they
boldly attacked us, and slew Sir Hugues de Trichatel, lord d’Escoflans, who
bore the banner of our company. They also made prisoner Sir Raoul de
Wanon, of our company, whom they had struck to the ground. As they
were carrying him off, my knights and myself knew him, and instantly
hastened, with great courage, to assist him, and deliver him from their hands.
In returning from this engagement the Turks gave me such heavy blows,
that my horse, not being able to withstand them, fell on his knees, and
threw me to the ground over his head. I very shortly replaced my shield
on my breast, and grasped my spear, during which time the lord Errart
d’Esmeray, whose soul may God pardon! advanced towards me, for he had
also been struck down by the enemy; and we retreated together towards an
old ruined house to wait for the king, who was coming, and I found means
to recover my horse. As we were going to this house, a large body of
Turks came galloping towards us, but passed on to a party of ours whom
they saw hard by; as they passed, they struck me to the ground, with my
shield over my neck, and galloped over me, thinking I was dead; and
indeed I was nearly so. When they were gone, my companion Sir Errart
came and raised me up, and we went to the walls of the ruined house.
Thither also had retired Sir Hugues d’Escosse, Sir Ferreys de Loppei, Sir
Regnault de Menoncourt, and several others; and there also the Turks
came to attack us, more bravely than ever, on all sides. Some of them
entered within the walls, and were a long time fighting with us at spear’s
length, during which my knights gave me my horse, which they held, lest
he should run away, and at the same time so vigorously defended us against
the Turks, that they were greatly praised by several able persons who witnessed
their prowess.</p>

<p>Sir Hugues d’Escosse was desperately hurt by three great wounds in the
face and elsewhere. Sir Raoul and Sir Ferreys were also badly wounded in
their shoulders, so that the blood spouted out just like to a tun of wine
when tapped. Sir Errart d’Esmeray was so severely wounded in the face by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
a sword, the stroke of which cut off his nose, that it hung down over his
mouth. In this severe distress, I called to my mind St. James, and said,
“Good Lord St. James, succour me, I beseech thee; and come to my aid in
this time of need.” I had scarcely ended my prayer, when Sir Errart said to
me, “Sir, if I did not think you might suppose it was done to abandon you
and save myself, I would go to my lord of Anjou, whom I see on the plain,
and beg he would hasten to your help.” “Sir Errart,” I replied, “you will
do me great honour and pleasure, if you will go and seek succour to save our
lives; for your own also is in great peril”; and I said truly, for he died of
the wound he had received. All were of my opinion that he should seek for
assistance; and I then quitting hold of the rein of his bridle, he galloped
towards the count d’Anjou, to request he would support
us in the danger we were in. There was a great lord
with him who wished to detain him, but the good
prince would not attend to what he urged, but, spurring
his horse, galloped towards us followed by his men.
The Saracens, observing them coming, left us; but
when on their arrival they saw the Saracens carrying
away their prisoner, Sir Raoul de Wanon, badly
wounded, they hastened to recover him, and brought
him back in a most pitiful state. Shortly after, I saw
the king arrive with all his attendants, and with a
terrible noise of trumpets, clarions, and horns. He
halted on an eminence, with his men at arms, for something
he had to say; and I assure you I never saw so
handsome a man under arms. He was taller than any
of his troop by the shoulders; and his helmet, which
was gilded, was handsomely placed on his head; and he
bore a German sword in his hand. Soon after he had
halted, many of his knights were observed intermixed
with the Turks; their companions instantly rushed
into the battle among them; and you must know, that
in this engagement were performed, on both sides, the
most gallant deeds that were ever done in this expedition
to the Holy Land; for none made use of the bow,
cross-bow, or other artillery. But the conflict consisted
of blows given to each other by battle-axes, swords,
butts of spears, all mixed together. From all I saw, my
knights and myself, all wounded as we were, were very
impatient to join the battle with the others. Shortly
after, one of my esquires, who had once fled from my
banner, came to me, and brought me one of my Flemish
war-horses; I was soon mounted, and rode by the side of the king, whom I
found attended by that discreet man, Sir John de Valeri. Sir John seeing
the king desirous to enter into the midst of the battle, advised him to make
for the riverside on the right, in order that in case there should be any
danger, he might have support from the duke of Burgundy and his army,
which had been left behind to guard the camp; and likewise that his men
might be refreshed and have wherewith to quench their thirst; for the
weather was at this moment exceedingly hot.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p439.jpg" width="150" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thirteenth Century Crusader</span></p>
</div>

<p>As this was doing, Sir Humbert de Beaujeu, constable of France, came
up, and told the king that his brother, the count d’Artois, was much pressed
in a house at Mansura, where, however, he defended himself gallantly, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
that he would need speedy assistance; and entreated the king to go to his aid.
The king replied, “Constable, spur forward, and I will follow you close.” All
of us now galloped straight to Mansura, and were in the midst of the Turkish
army, when we were instantly separated from each other by the greater power
of the Saracens and Turks. Shortly after, a serjeant at mace of the constable,
with whom I was, came to him, and said the king was surrounded by the Turks,
and his person in imminent danger. You may suppose our astonishment and
fears, for there were between us and where the king was full one thousand
or twelve hundred Turks, and we were only six persons in all. I said to the
constable, that since it was impossible for us to make our way through such
a crowd of Turks, it would be much better to wheel round and get on the
other side of them. This we instantly did. There was a deep ditch on
the road we took between the Saracens and us; and, had they noticed us,
they must have slain us all; but they were solely occupied with the king,
and the larger bodies; perhaps also they might have taken us for some of
their friends. As we thus gained the river, following its course downward
between it and the road, we observed that the king had ascended it, and that
the Turks were sending fresh troops after him. Both armies now met on the
banks, and the event was miserably unfortunate; for the weaker part of our
army thought to cross over to the division of the duke of Burgundy, but
that was impossible from their horses being worn down, and the extreme heat
of the weather. As we descended the river, we saw it covered with lances,
pikes, shields, men, and horses, unable to save themselves from death. When
we perceived the miserable state of our army, I advised the constable to remain
on this side of the river to guard a small bridge that was hard by; “for
if we leave it,” added I, “the enemy may come and attack the king on this
side; and if our men be assaulted in two places, they must be discomfited.”</p>

<p>There then we halted; and you may believe me when I say, that the
good king performed that day the most gallant deeds that ever I saw in any
battle. It was said, that had it not been for his personal exertions, the
whole army would have been destroyed; but I believe that the great courage
he naturally possessed was that day doubled by the power of God, for he
forced himself wherever he saw his men in any distress, and gave such
blows with battle-axe and sword, it was wonderful to behold. The lord
de Courtenai and Sir John de Salenai one day told me, that at this engagement
six Turks caught hold of the bridle of the king’s horse, and
were leading him away; but this virtuous prince exerted himself with such
bravery in fighting the six Turks, that he alone freed himself from them;
and that many, seeing how valiantly he defended himself, and the great
courage he displayed, took greater courage themselves, and abandoning the
passage they were guarding, hastened to support the king. After some little
time, the count Peter of Brittany came to us who were guarding the small
bridge from Mansura, having had a most furious skirmish. He was so
badly wounded in the face that the blood came out of his mouth, as if it had
been full of water, and he vomited it forth. The count was mounted on a
short, thick, but strong horse, and his reins and the pommel of his saddle
were cut and destroyed, so that he was forced to hold himself by his two
hands round the horse’s neck for fear the Turks, who were close behind him,
should make him fall off. He did not, however, seem much afraid of them,
for he frequently turned round, and gave them many abusive words by way
of mockery.</p>

<p>In our front were two of the king’s heralds; the name of one was Guillaume
de Bron, and that of the other John de Gaymaches; against whom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
Turks led a rabble of peasants of the country, who pelted them with clods
of earth and large stones. At last, they brought a villainous Turk, who
thrice flung Greek fires at them; and by one of them was the tabard of Guillaume
de Bron set on fire; but he soon threw it off, and good need had he, for
if it had set fire to his clothes, he must have been burned. We were also
covered with these showers of stones and arrows which the Turks discharged
at the two heralds. I luckily found near me a gaubison of coarse cloth which
had belonged to a Saracen, and turning the slit part inward, I made a sort of
shield, which was of much service to me; for I was only wounded by their
shots in five places, whereas my horse was hurt in fifteen. Soon after, as God
willed it, one of my vassals of Joinville brought me a banner with my arms,
and a long knife of war, which I was in want of; and then, when these Turkish
villains, who were on foot, pressed on the heralds, we made a charge on
them and put them instantly to flight. Thus when the good count de Soissons
and myself were returned to our post on the bridge, after chasing away these
peasants, he rallied me, saying, “Seneschal, let us allow this rabble to bawl and
bray; and, by the <i>Cresse Dieu</i>,” his usual oath, “you and I will talk over this
day’s adventures in the chambers of our ladies.”</p>

<p>It happened that towards evening, about sunset, the constable, Sir Humbert
de Beaujeu, brought us the king’s cross-bows that were on foot; and
they drew up in one front, while we horsemen dismounted under shelter of
the cross-bows. The Saracens observing this immediately took to flight, and
left us in peace. The constable told me that we had behaved well in thus
guarding the bridge; and bade me go boldly to the king, and not quit him
until he should be dismounted in his pavilion. I went to the king, and at
the same moment Sir John de Valeri joined, and requested of him, in the
name of the lord de Chastillon, that the said lord might command the rear
guard, which the king very willingly granted. The king then took the road
to return to his pavilion, and raised the helmet from his head, on which I gave
him my iron skull-cap, which was much lighter, that he might have more
air. Thus as we were riding together, Father Henry, prior of the hospital of
Ronnay, who had crossed the river, came to him and kissed his hand, fully
armed, and asked if he had heard any news of his brother the count d’Artois.
“Yes,” replied the king, “I have heard all”; that is to say, that he knew
well he was now in paradise. The prior, thinking to comfort him for the
death of his brother, continued, “Sire, no king of France has ever reaped such
honour as you have done; for with great intrepidity have you and your army
crossed a dangerous river to combat your enemies; and have been so very
successful that you have put them to flight and gained the field, together
with their warlike engines, with which they had wonderfully annoyed you,
and concluded the affair by taking possession this day of their camp and
quarters.” The good king replied that God should be adored for all the
good he had granted him; and then heavy tears began to fall down his
cheeks, which many great persons noticing, were oppressed with anguish
and compassion on seeing him thus weep, praising the name of God who
had enabled him to win the victory.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6f1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6f">f</a></span></p>

<h5>RESULTS OF MANSURA</h5>

<p>The count of Artois had rallied his forces in the town. The Egyptian
chief invested Mansura; and, with ability equal to his spirit, placed a body
of troops in such a station as to intercept the communication between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
count and the king. The soldiers in Mansura engaged the French. The
inhabitants partook of the perils of the day, and poured upon their enemy,
with deadly effect, burning coals, boiling water, and stones. The count did
not survive to witness all the dreadful issues of his rashness. William
Longespee and a numerous band of gallant men also perished. The grand
master of St. John fell into the enemy’s hands; and the master of the
Templars was happy in escaping with the loss of an eye. On the side of
the enemy Fakhr ad-Din was slain; but his station was quickly filled by a
chief of equal bravery and conduct. The king and his army had crossed the
ford, and prevented the total rout of the Christians. The valiant master of
the Templars was slain in this renewed engagement. Egyptian and Christian
annalists have claimed the honour and rewards of victory for their respective
sides; but in truth the result of the battle appears to have been indecisive.</p>

<p>The Saracens, however, cut off all communications between St. Louis
and Damietta. Famine and disease appeared in the Christian camp, and
the French described the latter of those evils as having sprung from a
pestilential air emitted from the dead bodies of their friends and foes, and
from eating eel pouts which had fed on corpses in the river.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6b2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6b">b</a></span> “From this
poisonous diet,” says De Joinville, “and from the bad air of a country where it
scarcely ever rains, the whole army was infected by a shocking disorder,
which dried up the flesh on one’s legs to the bone, and our skins became
tanned as black as the ground, or like an old boot that has long lain behind
a coffer. In addition to this miserable disorder, those afflicted by it had
another sore complaint in the mouth, from eating eel pouts that rotted the
gums. Very few escaped death that were attacked, and the surest symptoms
of its being fatal was a bleeding at the nose. The barbers were obliged to cut
away large pieces of flesh from the gums to enable the patient to eat. It was
pitiful to hear the cries and groans of those on whom the operation was performed;
they seemed like to the cries of women in labour, and I cannot express
the great concern all felt who heard them.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6f2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6f">f</a></span></p>

<h5>ST. LOUIS A PRISONER</h5>

<p>Negotiations for peace were opened between the contending powers, and the
exchange of the lordship of Jerusalem for that of Damietta formed the basis of
the treaty. The king offered either of his brothers as a hostage for the delivery
of Damietta to the Egyptians; but the sultan objected, and all hopes of peace
were abandoned, because the Christians would not consent to the delivery of
their king as the hostage. The miserable condition of the French army
forbade all thoughts of victory, and called for a retreat to Damietta.</p>

<p>The retreat was ordered; but those who attempted it by the river were
taken by the enemy, and the fate of such as proceeded by land was equally disastrous.
While they were occupied in constructing a bridge over the canal,
the Mussulmans entered the camp, and murdered the sick. The valiant Louis,
though oppressed with the general calamity of disease, sustained boldly, with
Sir Godfrey de Sergines, the shock of the enemy, and threw himself into the
midst of them, resolved to perish in defending his troops. The brave Sergines,
who never left him, succeeded at last in drawing him from the foe, and conducted
him to a village, where he sank into insensibility and helplessness.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span></p>

<p>In that state the Mussulmans made him prisoner. Charles count of Anjou,
Alphonsus of Poitiers, and indeed all the nobility fell into the enemy’s hands.
The sultan clothed the king and the nobles with robes of honour, and treated
them with kindness and generosity. But many of the unfortunate men who
were ill, and therefore useless, were killed by their new masters in defiance of
the command of Saladin, and the general usage of oriental nations not to put
to death anyone to whom they had given bread and salt. Other prisoners
saved their lives by renouncing their religion; the Saracenic commander indulged
the fanaticism of his people by allowing the converts to be received,
though he well remembered the sage remark of Saladin, that a Christian was
never known to make a good Moslem, nor a good Saracen a Christian.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> So
great were the calamities of the French in this attempted retreat, that twenty
thousand were made captives, and seven thousand were slain or drowned.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6b3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6b">b</a></span>
The last battles and disasters of St. Louis made, it may well be believed, a
vivid impression on the Saracens. We may quote the account of Makrisi,
a Moslem historian.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>MOSLEM ACCOUNT OF ST. LOUIS’ CAPTURE</h5>

<p>The day of Bairam (January 6th, 1250) a great lord and relative to the
king of France was made prisoner. Not a day passed without skirmishes on
both sides, and with alternate success. The Mussulmans were particularly
anxious to make prisoners, to gain information as to the state of the enemy’s
army, and used all sorts of stratagems for this purpose. A soldier from
Cairo bethought himself of putting his head withinside of a watermelon, the
interior of which he had scooped out, and of thus swimming towards the French
camp; a Christian soldier, not suspecting the trick, leaped into the Nile to seize
the melon; but the Egyptian was a stout swimmer, and catching hold of him,
dragged him to his general. On Wednesday, the 7th day of the moon Shawwal
(January 13th, 1250), the Mussulmans captured a large boat, in which
were a hundred soldiers, commanded by an officer of distinction. On Thursday,
the 15th of the same moon, the French marched out of their camp, and
their cavalry began to move. The troops were ordered to file off, when a
slight skirmish took place, and the French left on the field forty cavaliers
with their horses.</p>

<p>Some traitors having shown the ford over the canal of Ashmun to the
French, fourteen hundred cavaliers crossed it and fell unexpectedly on the
camp of the Mussulmans, on a Tuesday, the 15th day of the moon Dhul-Kadeh
(February 15th), having at their head the brother of the king of France.
The emir Fakhr ad-Din was at the time in the bath; he instantly quitted it
with precipitation and mounted a horse without a saddle or bridle, followed
only by some slaves. The enemy attacked him on all sides, and his slaves like
cowards, abandoned him when in the midst of the French; it was in vain
he attempted to defend himself; he fell pierced with wounds. The French,
after the death of Fakhr ad-Din, retreated to Jédilé; but their whole cavalry
advanced to Mansura, and, having forced one of the gates, entered the
town; the Mussulmans fled to the right and left. The king of France had
already penetrated as far as the sultan’s palace, and victory seemed ready to
declare for him, when the Baharite slaves, led by Bibars, advanced and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
snatched it from his hands; their charge was so furious that the French were
obliged to retreat. The French infantry, during this time, had advanced to
cross the bridge; had they been able to join their cavalry, the defeat of
the Egyptian army, and the loss of the town of Mansura, would have
been inevitable.</p>

<p>Night separated the combatants, when the French retreated in disorder
to Jédilé, after leaving fifteen hundred of their men on the field. They surrounded
their camp with a ditch and wall, but their army was divided into
two corps; the least considerable body was encamped on the branch of the
Ashmun, and the larger on the great branch of the Nile that runs to Damietta.
A pigeon had been let loose to fly to Cairo the instant the French had
surprised the camp of Fakhr ad-Din, having
a note under its wing, to inform the inhabitants
of this misfortune. The melancholy
event had created a general consternation
in the town, which the runaways had augmented,
and the gates of Cairo were kept
open all the night to receive them. A
second pigeon bearing the news of the
victory over the French, had restored tranquillity
to the capital. Joy succeeded
sorrow; and each congratulated the other
on this happy turn of affairs, and public
rejoicings were made.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Saracen</span></p>
</div>

<p>Boats sent from Damietta brought all
sorts of provisions to the French camp,
and kept it abundantly supplied. Turan
Shah caused many boats to be built which,
when taken to pieces, he placed on the backs
of camels, and had them thus carried to the
canal of Méhalé, when they were put together
again, launched on the canal, and
filled with troops for an ambuscade. As
soon as the French fleet of boats appeared
at the mouth of the canal of Méhalé, the
Mussulmans quitted their hiding-place and
attacked them. While the two fleets were
engaged, other boats left Mansura filled
with soldiers, and fell on the rear of the
French. It was in vain they sought to
escape by flight; a thousand Christians were killed or made prisoners. In
this defeat fifty-two of their boats laden with provisions were taken, and
their communication with Damietta by the navigation of the Nile was cut
off, so that within a short time the whole army suffered the most terrible
famine. The Mussulmans surrounded them on all sides, and they could
neither advance nor retreat.</p>

<p>On the first of the moon Dhul-hija (March 7th), the French surprised
seven boats; but the troops on board had the good fortune to escape. In
spite of the superiority of the Egyptians on the Nile, they attempted to bring
up another convoy from Damietta, but they lost it; thirty-two of their boats
were taken and carried to Mansura, on the ninth of the same moon. This
new loss filled the measure of their woes, and caused them to propose a truce
and send ambassadors to treat of it with the sultan. The emir Zain ad-Din<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
and the kadi Bedr ad-Din were ordered to meet and confer with them,
when the French offered to surrender Damietta, on condition that Jerusalem,
and some other places in Syria, should be given in exchange for it. This
proposal was rejected, and the conference broken up.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 27th of the moon Dhul-hija (April 2nd), the French set fire
to all their machines of war and timber for building, and rendered almost all
their boats unfit for use. During the night of Tuesday, the third day of the
moon Muharrem (April 7th), in the year of the Hegira 648, the whole of
the French army decamped, and took the road to Damietta. Some boats
which they had reserved fell down the Nile at the same time. The Mussulmans
having, at break of day of the Wednesday, perceived the retreat of
the French, pursued and attacked them.</p>

<p>The heat of the combat was at Fariskur. The French were defeated
and put to flight; ten thousand of their men fell on the field of battle, some
say thirty thousand. Upwards of one hundred thousand horsemen, infantry,
tradespeople, and others were made slaves. The booty was immense in
horses, mules, tents, and other riches. There were but one hundred slain
on the side of the Mussulmans. The Baharite slaves, under the command
of Bibars al-Bundukdari, performed in this battle signal acts of valour. The
king of France had retired, with a few of his lords, to a small hillock, and
surrendered himself, under promise of his life being spared, to the eunuch
Jemal ad-Din Mahsun as-Salih; he was bound with a chain, and in this state
conducted to Mansura, where he was confined in the house of Ibrahim ben
Lokman, secretary to the sultan, and under the guard of the eunuch Salih.
The king’s brother was made prisoner at the same time, and carried to the
same house. The sultan provided for their subsistence.</p>

<p>The number of slaves was so great, it was embarrassing, and the sultan
gave orders to Saif ad-Din Jusuf ben Tardi to put them to death. Every night
this cruel minister of the vengeance of his master had from three to four
hundred of the prisoners brought from their places of confinement, and after
he had caused them to be beheaded, their bodies were thrown into the Nile;
in this manner perished one hundred thousand of the French.</p>

<p>The sultan departed from Mansura, and went to Fariskur, where he had
pitched a most magnificent tent. He had also built a tower of wood over
the Nile; and, being freed from a disagreeable war, he there gave himself
up to all sorts of debauchery. The victory he had just gained was so brilliant
that he was eager to make all who were subjected to him acquainted
with it. He wrote with his own hand a letter, in the following terms, to the
emir Jemal ad-Din ben Jagmur, governor of Damascus: “Thanks be given to
the All-powerful, who has changed our grief to joy; it is to Him alone we
owe the victory. The favours He has condescended to shower upon us are innumerable,
but this last is most precious. You will announce to the people
of Damascus, or, rather, to all Mussulmans, that God has enabled us to gain
a complete victory over the Christians at the moment they had conspired our
ruin. On Monday, the first day of this year, we opened our treasury and
distributed riches and arms to our faithful soldiers. We had called to our
succour the Arabian tribes, and a numberless multitude of soldiers ranged
themselves under our standards. On the night between Tuesday and
Wednesday our enemies abandoned their camp, with all their baggage, and
marched towards Damietta; in spite of the obscurity of the night, we pursued
them, and thirty thousand of them were left dead on the field, not including
those who precipitated themselves into the Nile. We have, besides,
slain our very numerous prisoners, and thrown their bodies into the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
river. Their king had retreated to Minieh; he has implored our clemency,
and we have granted him his life, and paid him all the honours due to his
rank. We have regained Damietta.”</p>

<p>The sultan, with this letter, sent the king’s cap, which had fallen in the
combat; it was of scarlet, lined with a fine fur. The governor of Damascus
put the king’s cap on his own head when he read to the public the sultan’s
letter. A poet made these verses on the occasion: “The cap of the
French was whiter than paper; our sabres have dyed it with the blood of
the enemy, and have changed its colour.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6g"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6g">g</a></span></p>

<p>As ransom for the noble prisoners the sultan offered to accept some of
the baronial castles in Palestine, or those which belonged to the Templars
and Hospitallers. But the king and his peers replied that the liege lord, the
emperor of Germany, would never consent that a pagan or Tatar should hold
any fief of him; and that no cession of the property of the knights could be
made, for the governors of their castles swore on their investiture that they
would never surrender their charge for the deliverance of any man. The
king was even threatened with torture, but as the Mussulmans saw in him
no symptoms of fear on which they could work, they proposed to make a
pecuniary ransom. Louis offered to pay ten thousand golden besants, which
were equal to five hundred thousand livres, for the deliverance of his army,
and that as the royal dignity could not be estimated by a vulgar scale, he
would for his own freedom surrender the city of Damietta. The sultan was
liberal in the fulness of his joy at such a completion of his victories, and
remitted a fifth part of the pecuniary ransom.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Peace was to continue for
ten years between the Mussulmans and the Christians, and the Franks were
to be restored to those privileges in the kingdom of Jerusalem which they
enjoyed before the landing of Louis at Damietta. The repose which succeeded
the treaty was interrupted by the murder of the sultan; but after
a few acts of hostility the successful emirs, and their mamelukes, renewed
with a few changes the condition of amity. One moiety of the ransom was
to be discharged before the king left the river, and the other on his arrival
at Acre. The sick at Damietta, with the stores and baggage, were to be
retained by the sultan till the last portion of the ransom should be paid.</p>

<p>Damietta was accordingly surrendered. But the mamelukes were more
savage and unprincipled than any preceding enemies of the Latin name.
They burned all the military engines, murdered the sick, and some of the
most ferocious thirsted for the blood of the Christian potentates. The
counsels of justice prevailed, and the Christians were relieved from their
fears that the treaty would not be acted upon. The counts of Flanders and
Brittany, the count of Soissons, and others embarked for France. The
royal treasure at Damietta could not furnish the stipulated portion of the
ransom. The new grand master of the Templars opposed the institutes
of his order to the king’s request for a loan of the funds of the society, and
contended that he could not divert them from their regular and appointed
purposes. But state necessity trampled over mere statutable forms, and the
chest of the Templars was seized by the royal officers. The king’s person
was redeemed, and the French went to Acre.</p>

<p>The expedition of St. Louis into Egypt resembles in many respects the
war in Egypt thirty years before. In both cases the Christian armies were
encamped near the entrance of the Ashmun canal; they could not advance,
and the surrender of Damietta was the price of safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1250-1254 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Many of Louis’ council were astonished at his resolution to remain in
Palestine while political affairs were calling him to his duty to France.
They were divided in their patriotism and their allegiance. The sultan
of Damascus, a relative of the murdered Egyptian lord, solicited the aid of
Louis to revenge the murder, and stimulated his virtue by the promise
that in the event of victory he would deliver to the Christians the city
of Jerusalem. The king replied that he would send to the mamelukes at
Damietta, to know whether they would repair their violations of the treaty,
and that, in case of their refusal, he would assist the sultan of Damascus.
On intelligence of this negotiation, the people of Damietta restored to the
king all the knights and common soldiers whom they had detained in prison.
Louis wisely profited by circumstances, and declared that he would not enter
upon a truce with the Egyptians, until they had absolved him from the payment
of the remaining moiety of the ransom, and restored to him the
heads of those Christians on the walls of Cairo, who had fallen in the battle
near Mansura, and such Christian children as they had forced to become
Mussulmans. The emirs and mamelukes complied with these terms, and,
on condition of the alliance of the French king, they engaged to deliver up
to him Jerusalem itself. The military force of Louis did not much exceed
four thousand men. The king’s two brothers returned to Europe; and, in
order to retain a respectable army, Louis was obliged to be liberal of his
treasure. Louis remained a year at Cæsarea, and rebuilt its houses and
repaired its fortifications. Joppa was the next object of his care. The war
between the Egyptians and Syrians raged with dreadful violence. By the
mediation of the caliph, the Mussulmans made peace; Egypt and Jerusalem
were to belong to the mamelukes; and the countries beyond the Jordan to
the sultan of Syria. But the united infidels did not pursue their schemes
of destruction with that vigour and ability which had distinguished the
fierce and dreadful movements of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. They might have
swept the feeble and exhausted Christians from the shores of Palestine; but
they merely ravaged the country round Acre, and then proceeded to Sajecte,
in whose strong castle were Louis and most of the army. The blood and
property of the citizens satisfied the Moslems, who departed without trying
the valour of the French in garrison.</p>

<p>Perpetual disappointment gradually desiccated the spring of hope, and
the king turned his mind to France. His friends marked his change of
purpose, and news from Europe of the death of his royal mother, the regent
of his kingdom, made him openly proclaim his resolution to return. The
patriarch and barons of Palestine offered him their humble thanks and praise
for the great good and honour he had conferred on the Holy Land; and,
shortly after Easter, he embarked for the West. Louis IX gathered no new
laurels in his transmarine expedition. All that was great and chivalric in
France had been spread out in martial array, and had met with little else
than discomfiture and defeat. In the course of Louis’ stay at Joppa, the
sultan of Damascus sent him permission to visit Jerusalem. The king
ardently desired to behold the sacred places, and was slow in allowing considerations
of policy to conquer selfish feelings. The reason which dissuaded
him from the journey, was, that if he should perform a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem without delivering it from the enemies of God, every subsequent
crusading monarch would think a similar proceeding sufficient, and would
not consider himself obliged to perform more than what the king of France
had done. St. Louis was also reminded that Richard Cœur de Lion refused
to behold Jerusalem as a pilgrim.</p>

<h5>THE CHRISTIANS QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1255-1259 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>All the blood which had been shed, and all the treasure which France
had lavished for the crusade of St. Louis, did not long preserve the Christians
in Palestine from the hostilities of the Mussulmans, and, as no new
succours arrived from Europe, the barons and knights were compelled, in
some cases, to keep within the shelter of their fortresses, and at other times
to make disadvantageous treaties with their foe. Although it was evident
that nothing but unanimity in the holy warriors could preserve the remnants
of the kingdom of Godfrey de Bouillon from annihilation, yet the Christians
wasted their strength in party collisions, instead of watching the politics of
the Saracenian courts, and gathering those branches of power which their
enemies, in their ambitious feuds, continually broke from the tree of Islamism.
The haughty republicans of Italy would never enter into any common
bond of union, and the Venetians, the Pisans, and the Genoese had frequent
hostile encounters, respecting the possession of churches to which each
nation asserted her claims. The two great military orders only forgot their
mutual jealousies when in the field they were opposed to the Moslems, but
in every interval of peace, the knights, incapable of any exertions or thoughts
but those which war inspired, gratified their arrogance and restlessness in
disputes touching military prowess and precedency. As reason did not give
birth to these altercations, she did not control the decision.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p448.jpg" width="500" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A German Crusader, Thirteenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>The jealousy and rancour of the Hospitallers and Red Cross knights were
frequently aggravated by irregular skirmishes, and at length the kindred
squadrons met in a general engagement. Victory sat on the helms of the
cavaliers of St. John; few prisoners were taken, and scarcely a Templar
escaped alive. But new companions from Europe gradually filled the places
of the deceased brethren. New occasions demanded all their valour and
skill, and civil discord was lost amidst the more honourable war with the
real enemies of the state.</p>

<p>A blood-stained revolution in Egypt had placed the mameluke chief
Bibars, or Bundukdari, on the throne of that country; he was well disposed
to lead his savage mamelukes against the Christians, and his ferocity did not
want the excitement which the military orders gave it, of refusing, contrary
to treaty, to deliver to him some Mohammedan prisoners. His soldiers, as
savage as the Khwarizmians, demolished the churches of Nazareth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
fortress and church on Mount Tabor. They made their way to the gates
of Acre with fire and sword, and such of the Christians as were immediately
slain were not so much objects of compassion as the prisoners on whom the
Turks inflicted every description of torture, in order to force a change
of religion. Though Acre itself was saved for a few years, yet Cæsarea
did not escape the wide-spreading calamities. Through these dreadful
scenes the military orders fought with their usual heroism, and in the sieges
of the strong fortresses of Azotus and Saffuria, the spirit of devotion
which they manifested to their cause had never been equalled. The small
force of ninety Hospitallers held possession of the former of these places.
The number gradually diminished on each renewed assault, and when the
Turks mounted the breach, they trampled on the bodies of the last of
the knights.</p>

<p>After ravaging the neighbourhood of Acre, Tyre, and Tripolis, the
Egyptians laid siege to the fortress of Saffuria. The fall of that place was
inevitable, and the prior of the Templars therefore agreed to capitulate, and,
on the surrender being made, the knights and garrison, altogether amounting
to six hundred men, were to be conducted to the next Christian town.
The sultan was invested with lordship over the fortress, but he violated
the conditions of the surrender, and left the knights only a few hours to
determine on the alternative of death or conversion to Islam. The prior
and two Franciscan monks were earnest in fixing the faith of the religious
cavaliers, and, at the appointed time for the declaration of their choice,
they unanimously avowed their determination to die rather than incur the
dishonour of apostacy. The decree for the slaughter of the Templars
was pronounced and executed; and the three preachers of martyrdom were
flayed alive.</p>

<h5>HISTORY OF ANTIOCH (1206-1268 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1206-1268 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Before we continue our review of the calamities of Palestine, a retrospect
must be taken of a principality whose fate was closely connected with that
of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem. Bohemond IV continued to be the
reputed lord of Antioch, from the year 1206 till the time of his death
in 1233. But for many years during this interval he did not exercise any
royal authority, for he was a tyrant, and was both hated by the people and
excommunicated by the clergy. His nephew Rupin, the right heir, was
aided by the papal legate, who was present at the great siege of Damietta,
in the year 1218, and made several attempts to recover his thrones of Antioch
and Tripolis; but he died some years before Bohemond, in a prison at
Tarsus, into which he had been cast by Constantius, nominal regent of
Antioch, and guardian of Isabella, daughter and successor of Livon, king
of Armenia. From Bohemond IV and his first wife Plaisance, daughter of
the lord of Gabala, Bohemond V descended. To him succeeded Bohemond
VI. It does not appear that the family of the Bohemonds were entire masters
of the principality and county from the year 1233 till their absorption
in the Egyptian power. It is certain that Bohemond V was reigning over
Antioch and Tripolis in 1244, when he became tributary to the Khwarizmians;
and that in 1253 Bohemond VI was made a knight by St. Louis, and
was considered lawful prince of Antioch, though he was a minor, and under
his mother’s tutelage. But it is equally certain that at times, from 1233 to
1288, Frederick and Conrad, a son and grandson of the emperor Frederick
II, had possession of all or part of the states of Antioch and Tripolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span></p>

<h5>RAVAGES OF BIBARS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1268-1269 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>We may now resume the thread of the general history. Joppa and the
castle of Beaufort were the mameluke conquests which succeeded in point of
time to those of Azotus and Saffuria.</p>

<p>The tempest at length burst upon the state of Antioch; and the city
of that principality yielded without even the formality of a siege (1268).
The reproach of treachery is alternately cast upon the patriarch and the inhabitants;
and heavy is the disgrace of causing an event which occasioned
the destruction of forty thousand, and the captivity of one hundred thousand
Christians. Bibars ravaged the country round Tyre; but being equally religious
and cruel, he gave the Franks a respite by pilgrimising to the holy places
in Arabia. He soon, however, resumed his fell purpose of exterminating
the Christians; Laodicea and many other places submitted to him; and the
knights of St. John gained immortal honour by their brave, though fruitless,
defence of the fortress of Karak, between Arca and Tortosa. The
prince of Tripolis preserved his title by the sacrifice of half of his territory.
Acre was saved in consequence of the reported succour of the king of Cyprus.
Bibars returned to Cairo, hastily fitted out a fleet for the conquest
of the island, which was without the presence of its monarch. But his
ships were lost in a tempest; Cairo was overwhelmed with sorrow, and none
of his efforts could re-establish affairs.</p>

<h5>SECOND CRUSADE AND DEATH OF LOUIS IX</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1269-1270 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Before the news of the capture of Antioch reached Europe, the people of
the West had contemplated a new crusade. St. Louis thought that his first
expedition to the Holy Land brought more shame on France than good on
the Christian cause; and he feared that his own personal fame had withered.
The pope encouraged his inclinations for a new attempt. England was at
that time in a state of repose, and her martial youth were impatient of indolence.
Prince Edward, with the earls of Warwick and Pembroke, received
the holy ensign. The assumption of the cross by the heir of the English
throne spread great joy throughout France. He was invited to Paris; the
co-operation of the English and French was determined upon; and Louis
lent his youthful ally thirty thousand marks on the security of the customs
of Bordeaux. The prelates and clergy of England agreed to contribute a
tenth of their revenue for three years; and by a parliamentary ordinance,
a twentieth part was taken from the corn and movables which the laity possessed
at Michaelmas. A crusade had for many years been popular in England.
During the first expedition of St. Louis, and soon after the departure
of William Longsword, Henry III engaged to fight under the sacred banners.
But he was slow in preparing to go to the Holy Land; and the public murmured
the suspicion that he had only assumed the cross as a pretence for collecting
money. It was found that five hundred knights had been crossed;
and the number of inferior people could not be counted. The holy warriors
resolved to commence their voyage at midsummer; but the king had anticipated
all their proceedings; and he declared that if they dared to march without
him the thunders of the Vatican should be hurled against them. Some
people submitted to, and others clamoured at this menace of papal interference;
and the religious ardour of the most enthusiastic was cooled by the
king’s delays, and the news of the disastrous events in Egypt. The pope and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
king were deaf to the reproaches of the French nation that indifference
to Christianity could be the only motive for obstructing the pious wishes of
the English people.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The king’s poverty was ever the alleged cause of his
remissness; and two years after his dissolution of the association of English
knights, he endeavoured to extort money from the clergy on the pretence
of a journey to Syria. But they resisted his demands; and reproached him
with his avarice and violation of oaths.</p>

<p class="caption">DEATH OF ST. LOUIS</p>
</div>

<p>Anticipating the laurel of victory, or the crown of martyrdom, St. Louis
spread his sails for the Holy Land in 1270. Sixty thousand soldiers were
animated by their monarch’s feelings of religious and military ardour; and
we may remark among the leaders the lords of Flanders, Champagne, and
Brittany. The fleet was driven into Sardinia; and at that place a great
change was made in the plan of operations. The king of Tunis had formerly
sent ambassadors to Louis, and expressed a wish to embrace the only
true religion. Northern Africa had formerly paid a pecuniary tribute to the
sovereign of the Two Sicilies; and Charles of Anjou, the reigning monarch,
concealing his selfishness under the garb of piety and justice, strongly urged
his brother to restore the rights of Christendom. The soldiers too, now
more greedy of plunder and revenge than zealous in bigotry, entreated to
be led to Tunis. The subjugation of the Mussulmans in Africa was declared
to be a necessary preliminary to successes in Palestine; the French soon
reached the first object of their hopes; and the camp and town of Carthage
were the earliest rewards of victory. But every sanguine expectation was
damped when a pestilential disease spread its ravages through the Christian
ranks.</p>

<p>The great stay of the Crusades fell August, 1270. During his illness
Louis ceased not to praise God, and supplicate for the people whom he
had brought with him. He became speechless; he then gesticulated what
he could not utter; he perpetually made signs of the cross, stretched himself
on the floor, which was covered with ashes; and in the final struggle of
nature he turned his eyes to heaven, and exclaimed, “I will enter thy house,
I will worship in thy sanctuary.”</p>

<h5>PRINCE EDWARD LEAVES ENGLAND</h5>

<p>Before this calamitous event Prince Edward, Edmund Crouchback, earl
of Lancaster, four earls, four barons, and the English division, had not only
arrived in Africa, but had left it for Sicily, in despair that their French
compeers would ever march to Palestine. The winter season was passed
by Prince Edward in military exercises, and in the various occupations of
chivalry, and in the following spring he turned his prow up the Mediterranean
and arrived at Acre.</p>

<p>The whole of the forces of Edward did not exceed one thousand men.
But the prowess of the Plantagenets was dreaded by the Mussulmans; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
they feared that another Cœur de Lion was come to scourge them. The sultan
of Egypt departed from the vicinity of Acre, which he had devastated with
fire and sword. All the Latins in Palestine crowded round the banner of
the English prince; and he took the field at the head of seven thousand
men. The city of Nazareth was redeemed; and he surprised and defeated a
large Turkish force. Edward was brave and provident, and owed his success
as much to his skill as to his courage. But he was not less cruel
than any preceding hero of the holy wars; and he gave a dreadful earnest
of that savage implacability which Scotland afterwards so often rued.
The barbarities which stained the entry of the Christians into Jerusalem,
two centuries before, were repeated in a smaller theatre of cruelty
in Nazareth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1271-1272 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But the march of victory was closed, for the English soldiers were parched
by the rays of a Syrian sun, and their leader was extended on the bed of sickness.
The governor of Joppa was the apparent friend of Edward, but the
sultan’s threat of degradation, if further commerce were held with an infidel,
changed courtesy into malignity. He hired an assassin who, as the bearer
of letters, was admitted into the chamber of his intended victim. After
receiving two or three wounds, the vigorous prince threw the villain on the
floor and stabbed him to the heart. The dagger had been steeped in poison,
and for some hours Edward’s fate was involved in danger. The fairy hand
of fiction has ascribed his convalescence to his queen.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>After the English prince had been fourteen months in Acre, the sultan
of Egypt offered peace, for wars with the Moslem powers engrossed his military
strength. Edward gladly seized this occasion of leaving the Holy Land,
for his force was too small for the achievement of great actions, and his
father had implored his return to England. The hostile commanders signed
accordingly a treaty for a ten years’ suspension of arms; the lords of Syria
disarrayed their warlike front, and the English soldiers quitted Palestine for
their native country (July, 1272).</p>

<h5>VAIN EFFORTS OF GREGORY X</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1274-1291 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At the time when Palestine began to breathe from the horrors of war,
hope once more raised her head in consequence of the election to the chair
of St. Peter falling upon Theobald, archdeacon of Liège. The choice of the
cardinals was made known to him while he was in Palestine. He impatiently
transported himself to Italy, and so ardent was his zeal that his
endeavours for a crusade even preceded his introduction to the pontificate.
The trumpet of war again was heard among the nations. The blast was
however only faintly echoed. The republics of Pisa, Genoa, and Venice,
and the city of Marseilles, agreed to furnish a few galleys and twenty-five
thousand marks of silver were obtained from Philip the Hardy on mortgage
of the Templars’ estates in France. The masters of the military friars and
Red Cross knights went to Rome, and convinced their papal friend that
these succours would be too inconsiderable to enable the Christians to drive
infidels out of Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span></p>

<p>Again was the Christian world assembled, and the council of Lyons (May
1274) decreed the obligation of a new crusade. But Pope Gregory died
within two years after the sitting of the Lyonese council, and all thoughts
of a crusade were dropped when the life of its great promoter closed.</p>

<p>Palestine however was at peace. Hugh III, king of Cyprus, a lineal
descendant of the princess Alice, had been crowned king of Jerusalem at
Tyre, a short time before the death of Conradin, the last unhappy
descendant of that house of Germany, of which three emperors had supported
and adorned holy wars. The Templars befriended Charles of Anjou, but the
Hospitallers, with more virtue than was generally shown, declared that they
could not fight against any Christian prince, and contended that the claims
for succession to the kingdom ought to be deferred till the kingdom itself
should be recovered. In the fourth year of the peace which the valiant
prince Edward had gained for Palestine, the mameluke chief and king
Bundukdari, died.</p>

<p>In the reign of Kalaun, the third sultan in succession to him who had
torn so many cities from the Christians, the war was renewed (1280), and
after a few years of dreadful preparation the living cloud of war burst upon
the Christians. Margat was captured; but so brave had been the resistance
of the knights that it procured them a safe and honourable retreat to
the neighbouring town of Tortosa (1287), and the sultan, dreading even the
possibility of future opposition, razed the fortress.</p>

<h5>PROGRESS OF THE MAMELUKES</h5>

<p>With rapid and certain steps the power of the Latins approached its fatal
termination. The city of Tripolis, that last remaining satellite of the kingdom
of Jerusalem, was taken in 1289; its houses were burned, its works
dismantled, and its people murdered or retained in slavery. Acre once
more became the principal possession of the Christians. The sultan concluded
a treaty of peace with Henry II of Cyprus, who had driven away
the lieutenants and soldiers of Charles, and had been acknowledged king of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The grand-master crossed the Mediterranean in order to infuse his martial
spirit into the people of the West. Pope Nicholas IV heard with coldness
the dismal tale. He declined to open the treasury of St. Peter for the
advancement of the Christian cause, and he gave his noble friend only fifteen
hundred men&mdash;the offscourings of Italy. Circular letters were sent to
the different European potentates, but the light which once shone upon the
holy cause had waned; cavaliers no longer thronged round the cross, and
the grand-master was compelled to return to Palestine, accompanied only
by his Italian banditti. When they arrived at Acre, the city was in the
greatest state of turbulence. Within its walls were crowded the wretched
remains of those kingdoms and principalities which had been won by the
blood of the West. Every distinct people occupied a particular division, and,
in the assertion of individual privileges, general interests were forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1291-1300 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The sultan died before his preparations of vengeance were completed;
but his son Khalil was not less anxious than his father to exterminate the
infidel miscreants. In April, 1291, nearly two hundred thousand mameluke
Tatars of Egypt marched into Palestine, and encamped before Acre, exactly
on the same ground upon which a century before assembled Europe had stood.
To avoid the dreadful consequences of war, a large part of the population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
embarked in the numerous vessels which at that time rode at anchor in the
harbour, and the defence of the place was left to the care of about twelve
thousand soldiers. The garrison was speedily reinforced by a few hundred
men, headed by Henry II of Cyprus, who boasted the ideal title of king of
Jerusalem. But the Christians beheld their towers yielding to the mines
and battering-rams. The pusillanimous monarch, seizing a few ships, sailed
to Cyprus. With the morn, the mamelukes renewed the attack. Most of
the German cavaliers died upon the breach; the others slowly left the walls,
and the firmness of their little phalanx checked the foe. The Hospitallers
chased back the mamelukes, and even forced them headlong into the ditch.
But the sultan was prodigal of blood. His battalions marched to the breach,
and in a few hours the entry into the city was repeatedly lost and won by
the Christians and infidels.</p>

<p>Under the cover of a few cross-bowmen, the knights of St. John, seven only
were the remnant, embarked, and left forever the scene of their virtue and
their valour. Their brethren in arms, the Templars, were equally brave,
and their fate was equally disastrous. Their resistance was so firm, that the
sultan was compelled to promise them a free and honourable departure. But
the insults of some low Saracenian people irritated the cavaliers; the sword
again was drawn, and such of the Templars as survived the conflict, fled
into the interior country. The unarmed population of Acre hurried to the
coast; but the elements co-operated with the devastating spirit of the Turks,
and the tempestuous waves refused shelter to the fugitives. While gnashing
with despair, the people beheld their town in flames. The ruthless hand of
death fell upon them, and the sea shore of Palestine again drank torrents
of Christian blood.</p>

<h5>TOTAL LOSS OF THE HOLY LAND</h5>

<p>Tyre, Berytus, and other towns, were awed into submission. The Turks
swept all Palestine, and murdered or imprisoned all the Christians who could
not fly to Cyprus. The memory of the Templars is embalmed, for the last
struggle for the Holy Land was made by the Red Cross knights. Such as
escaped from Acre went to Sis, in Armenia. A Mussulman general drove
them to the island of Tortosa, whence they escaped to Cyprus, and the cry
of religious war no longer rung through Palestine.</p>

<p>The loss of the Holy Land did not fill Europe with those feelings of grief
and indignation which the fall of Jerusalem, an hundred years before, had
occasioned. The flame of fanaticism had slowly burned out. During the
thirteenth century, the territorial possessions of the Christians in Palestine
gradually diminished; the expeditions and reinforcements were in consequence
less vigorous, for, both politically and personally, the people of the
West declined in their interest in respect of the affairs of the East. Pope
Nicholas IV endeavoured to revive holy undertakings; but the kings of
Europe were deaf or disobedient. As Genoa was allied to the Grecian
emperor, Venice sought the friendship of the Mussulmans. The mamelukes
gave their Christian brothers a church, an exchange, and a magazine in
Alexandria; and the Venetians carried on the lucrative but disgraceful
trade of furnishing the Egyptian market with male and female slaves from
Georgia and Circassia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1299-1413 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p455.jpg" width="200" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Heralds of the Crusaders</span></p>
</div>

<p>There was some pretence for the preaching of a crusade by Pope Boniface
VIII in the year 1300. Kazan, the Mongol sultan of Persia, resolved
to exterminate the mamelukes of Egypt. He allied himself with the kings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
Georgia, Armenia, and Cyprus. In 1299 the fortunes of war smiled on the
allies; but still the success not being so great as what he had expected,
Kazan sent to the pope, soliciting the more powerful alliance of the princes
of the West, and agreeing that when Palestine was recovered, it should be
retained by the Christians. The project, though warmly patronised by the
pope, proved abortive. In the interim, the tide of victory flowed in favour
of the Egyptians. Kazan died about the year 1303.</p>

<p>From the commencement, till past the middle of the fourteenth century,
the popes repeatedly sounded the charge; but the West in most cases disregarded
the summons of its ghostly instructor;
and it was evident that, although
the papal rulers could fan, they could not
create the sacred flame. At the time when
the loss of the Holy Land became known
in Europe, the people had not recovered
from the astonishment and terror with which
the victories of Jenghiz Khan and his successors
had filled the West. Part of Russia,
the whole of Poland, Silesia, Moravia,
Hungary and all the countries to the
eastward of the Adriatic Sea, fell a prey to
barbaric desolation. Several of the popes
attempted in vain to soften the ferocity of
these new foes; but the papal legates were
dismissed with the tremendous command,
for Rome herself to submit her neck to the
Mongol yoke.</p>

<p>Though Europe in general felt that in
the fall of Acre all was lost, yet despair
did not immediately complete his triumph,
for chivalry and policy sometimes endeavoured
to revive the religious spark. If Pope
John XXII had not been too open in the
display of his avarice, and too prodigal in
the commutation of vows for money, the
knights of Germany would once more have
fought under the glorious ensign of the
cross. A threatened invasion from England
(1328 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) deterred Philip de Valois
from leaving his country for Palestine, and
a large body of crusaders was dispersed
when (1364 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) John Le Bon of France
died, on whom the pope intended to have
conferred the title of commander of the new
crusaders. The politic Henry IV<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of England wished to “busy giddy minds
with foreign quarrels,” in order to divert his people from looking too nearly
into his state, and to retain their newly sworn allegiance. Both his maritime
and military preparations were considerable; but the hand of nature stopped
him and it was his fate to succumb to death, before he could attempt to
commence his new religious career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span></p>

<h5>FATE OF THE MILITARY ORDERS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1291-1600 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Such were the last appearances of that martial frenzy which so long agitated
Europe; and here the history of the holy wars would naturally close,
if curiosity did not suggest an inquiry into some of those military and
religious orders which arose from the spirit of pilgrimages and crusades,
and whose existence forms one of the most prominent characteristics of the
Middle Ages. The knights of the Teutonic order were fixed in their conquest
of Prussia, some years before the loss of the Holy Land. Their love
of war was not extinguished; they carried both the sword and the Gospel
into Pomerania; and the eastern part of that country was definitively
ceded to the order by a treaty of peace in the year 1343. The town of
Dantzic, the capital of the new conquest, was considerably aggrandised
under the dominion of the knights, and became one of the principal places
of commerce on the Baltic. Pressed forward again by religion and ambition,
they made war on the infidel Lithuanians, but it was not till the beginning
of the fifteenth century, and after rivers of blood had flowed, that the
pagans lost their independence, and relinquished their national superstition.
But the oppressive government of the knights; their intestine divisions;
their heavy imposts, the unhappy result of wars continually reviving,
encouraged the nobility of Prussia and Pomerania to confederate, and to
seek the protection of the kings of Poland. The torch of war was rekindled,
the knights were defeated, and by the peace of Thorn in 1466 all Pomerania,
and indeed all the country which is generally called Polish Prussia, was
ceded to Poland. The order was allowed to preserve the west of Prussia
by the tenure of feudal service to the kings of Poland.</p>

<p>The Teutonic knights thus lost Prussia; their name appears on few
occasions in the history of Europe, and the order became only a “cheap
defence of nations.” Pope Innocent VIII in the year 1490 endeavoured to
suppress the order of the Knights of St. Lazarus. In Italy, perhaps he succeeded,
but not in any other country. The bull was resisted by the knights
of France and till the reign of Henry IV they were independent and elected
their own grand-masters.</p>

<h5>KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1291-1310 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After the loss of Acre, the knights of St. John and the Temple, from
every preceptory and commandery in Europe, flocked to Cyprus, impatient
for glory and revenge. The military friars soon quitted their settlements
in Cyprus. The grand-master of the Hospitallers gained the friendship and
the purse of Pope Clement V, and drew a flattering picture of Christian
prosperity, if the cavaliers of St. John could set up their banners in some
island in the Mediterranean. Rhodes was fixed upon. Fifteen years subsequently
to the loss of Acre, a new crusade was published, and the volunteers
were invited to repair to Brundusium. The king of Sicily and the
republic of Genoa furnished transports. The grand-master headed the army,
but it was not until after they had sailed, that the crusaders knew the object
of the armament. Rhodes was at that time in the power, partly of the
Greeks and partly of the Saracens. The soldiers landed; many battles were
fought, and the army of the invaders was at last reduced to the military
friars. Their chief hired new soldiers, recommenced his attacks, and the
whole island submitted to his authority (1310). The subsequent history of
the knights of St. John is interwoven with the general history of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span></p>

<h5>THE TEMPLARS IN FRANCE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1307-1311 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>While the military friars were planning the acquisition of an equivalent
to their loss in Palestine, most of the Red Cross knights gradually left
Cyprus, returned to their different commanderies, and lived in security and
indolence. But circumstances soon made the Templars repent that they
had not, like the Hospitallers, attempted a renewal of hostilities with the
infidels. Philip the Fair, king of France, acquainted Pope Clement V, that
the order of the knights Templar had been accused of heresy and various
other crimes against religion and morals. Some members had charged their
fraternity with the different abominations of treachery, murder, idolatry,
and Islamism. Philip the Fair took the bold step of imprisoning all the
knights Templar whom his officers could discover in France, and of sequestering
their property. Clement then circulated a bull throughout Christendom,
by which instrument of papal authority, nuncios and the resident clergy
were commanded to inquire into the conduct of the knights. His holiness
says that, pressed by public clamour and by the declarations of the king,
the barons, the clergy, and laity of France, he had examined seventy-two
members of the order, and had found them all guilty, though in various
degrees, of irreligion and immorality. Such of the knights as yielded to
blandishments and threats were pardoned, but the torture was applied
to those who denied the charges, and thirty-six knights in Paris heroically
braved the horrors of the rack, and maintained the innocence of the order,
till death closed their sufferings and their virtue. Others confessed in the
midst of corporeal agony, and afterwards recanted their confessions. The
knights Templar were accused of renouncing, at the time of their matriculation,
God, Jesus Christ, the Virgin, and all the saints. It was said that
the brethren used often to spit and trample on the cross, in proof of their
contempt of Christ, who was crucified for his own crimes and not for the
sins of the world. Out of their disdain of God and his Son, they adored a
cat, and certain wooden and golden idols. The master could absolve brethren
from sins. On the assurance that the king would destroy the order,
whether the result of the examinations were favourable or hostile to its continuance,
many knights had yielded to pain and hopelessness, stayed the
hand of the executioner, confessed every crime, upon their confessing of
which, royal pardon and protection were proffered. The court condemned
to perpetual imprisonment those from whom no confession of guilt had been
extorted. But such as had retracted their forced avowals were declared to
be relapsed heretics; they were delivered over to the secular power, and condemned
to the fire (May 11th, 1310). The number in the last-mentioned
class of the proscribed was fifty-four. All the historians who have spoken
of the event, whatever opinion they might have entertained on the general
question, friends or enemies, natives or strangers, have unanimously attested
the virtuous courage, the noble intrepidity, and the religious resignation,
which these martyrs of heroism displayed. Arrived at the place of punishment,
they beheld with firmness and placidity the piles of wood, and the
torches already lighted in the hands of the executioners. In vain a messenger
of the king promised pardon and liberty to those who did not persist
in their retractations; in vain their surrounding friends endeavoured to
touch their hearts by prayers and tears. Invoking God, the Virgin, and all
the saints, they sung the hymn of death; triumphing over the most cruel
tortures, they believed themselves already in the heavens, and died in the
midst of their songs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span></p>

<h5>IN OTHER COUNTRIES</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1311-1314 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>By royal command, the sheriffs of the different counties of England and
Wales seized the estates, and imprisoned the persons of the Templars. The
cavaliers were more than a year and a half in prison. At the end of that
time a papal bull was received in England; and the archbishop of Canterbury
appointed courts at London, York, and Lincoln, for the trial of the
Templars, July, 1311. The charges were the same in substance as those
which had been preferred against the order in France. Forty-seven of the
knights who had been incarcerated in the Tower were examined upon oath
before the bishop of London, some inferior clergy, and the representatives of
the pope. William de la Moore, the grand prior of England, was as earnest
as de Molay had been in defence of the French Templars.</p>

<p>Four knights made a general confession of crimes, when they were told
that the pope had authorised a full pardon to those who acknowledged their
iniquities; but that if they persisted in heresy, they should be considered and
punished as heretics. Thirteen newly admitted knights swore that they were
not acquainted with the secrets of the order, but that they were prepared to
renounce all the erroneous opinions in which it was possible the minds of
men could be stained. William de la Moore, the grand prior, was the only
man whom no fear of imprisonment or dread of ecclesiastical punishment
could induce to deny his first avowal of the innocence of the order. He was
requested to make a general confession; but he replied that he was not guilty
of heresy, and would never abjure crimes which he had not committed.</p>

<p>In Ireland about thirty Templars, in Scotland only two, were confined
and examined. In Lincoln the number somewhat exceeded twenty. There
were twenty-three in York. The general charges of apostasy and idolatry
were not proved in any case. However, all the knights made a general
confession of the offence of heresy, and avowed they could not cleanse themselves
from the crimes mentioned in the bull. The clergy pardoned them, and
received them again into the bosom of the church. They were then sent
into confinement in various monasteries until the decision of a general council
should be declared.</p>

<p>The fate of the Templars in other parts of the world remains to be told.
In Germany the innocence of the order was proved before the archbishops
of Mainz and Trèves, at councils held in their respective dioceses. In Italy
the pope had a little more success. Several Templars at Florence confessed
every species of abomination. Much blood was shed in Lombardy, Tuscany,
Sicily, Naples, and Provence, whenever the knights would not be guilty
of self-condemnation. In those parts of Spain where the conduct of the Templars
was inquired into, the result was an acquittal. Their military front
was powerful, and the ministers of papal vengeance did not dare to apply
the torture.</p>

<h5>COUNCIL AT VIENNE</h5>

<p>Four years after the first seizure of the Templars in France a council was
held at Vienne in Dauphiné, for the purpose of making some general decision
on the case of the order, October, 1311. The pope headed three hundred
bishops, and an untold number of inferior clergy. All men who desired to
defend the order were promised security and freedom. Nine cavaliers presented
themselves before the assembly in the character of representatives
of fifteen hundred of their brethren, who were living at Lyons, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
secret fastnesses of Savoy and Switzerland. Clement immediately violated
his promise of protection, and threw the nine knights into prison. He then
called upon the council for its opinion, whether in consequence of the confessions
of the Templars the society ought not to be dissolved? With the
disgraceful exception of one Italian prelate, and three French archbishops,
the whole body of churchmen declared that so illustrious an order as that
of the Red Cross knights ought not to be suppressed, until the grand-master
and the nine knights had been heard in its defence. The pope disregarded
the opinion of the majority; and tried in vain for six months to make a
change.</p>

<h5>THE ORDER SUPPRESSED</h5>

<p>The king of France arrived at Vienne, and sanctioned by his presence, the
pope declared that he should exercise the plenitude of papal authority. He
accordingly dissolved the order provisionally and not absolutely, and reserved
to himself the disposition of the persons and estates of the Templars.
When the subject of the distribution of the knights’ Templar estates was
debated in the council, the pope declared that they ought to be bestowed
upon the Hospitallers, because the original purpose of the order was the subjugation
of infidels, a purpose which the knights of Rhodes were earnestly
pursuing.</p>

<p>The decree of confiscation was executed throughout Christendom. The
Templars were robbed, but the Hospitallers did not enjoy the whole of the
plunder. Philip the Fair, and his successor Louis le Hutin, retained nearly
three hundred thousand livres [£12,000 or $60,000] for what they chose to
term the expenses of the prosecution. The landed estates were slowly and
unwillingly resigned, for the monarchs enjoyed the rents till the commissioners
of the knights of Rhodes established their rights. In Germany the
Teutonic knights assisted the Hospitallers in plundering those who had
formerly been their brethren in arms in Palestine. Dinis, king of Portugal,
preserved the order of the Red Cross knights, by changing their title from
the soldiers of the Temple to that of the soldiers of Christ. Edward of
England gave to different laymen much of the forfeited property. Numbers
of the nobility too as heirs of the original donors seized many of the
Templars’ estates. Indeed, so great was the injustice done to the Hospitallers,
that Pope John XXII censured both the clergy and laity, for their
disobedience to the decree of the council at Vienne.</p>

<p>The last circumstance which attended the fate of the Templars was the
condemnation of the grand-master, Jacques de Molay.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> With his dying lips
he bore testimony to the virtue of the order; and his mental sufferings on
account of his former want of firmness appeared to be greater than his mere
corporeal pain. The brother of the prince of Dauphiné met with the same
unhappy but honourable end as that of his friend Jacques de Molay. The
two priors seem to have died in prison.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6b4"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>THE CRUSADES IN THE WEST</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1230-1309 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Having completed the survey of the vain efforts for the Holy Land, it
will be well to glance at the contests springing up elsewhere on the same
fanatic belief that orthodoxy was a matter of life and death.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span></p>

<p>Though the Crusades met with failure in the East, in the West they
achieved their purpose; that is, certain expeditions were highly successful;
for example that of the Teutonic knights and sword-bearers into Prussia and
the neighbouring regions, where they founded a new state; also Simon de
Montfort’s war against the Albigenses which destroyed an ancient civilisation;
and the struggle between the Spaniards and the Moors, as a result of which
the latter were forced to surrender the peninsula over to Christianity and the
civilisation of Europe.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the scene of action of the European Crusades was
the two extremities of the continent; around the mouths of the Niemen the
pagans of the Baltic were to be converted, and in the country washed by
the Tagus, the Moslems of Spain.</p>

<h5>THE TEUTONIC CRUSADE</h5>

<p>In the interval between the First and Second Crusades some citizens of
Bremen and Lübeck had journeyed to the Holy Land and there founded a
hospital for their compatriots, which was exclusively under the management
of Germans. In Palestine all benevolent institutions were obliged to assume
the form of military organisations; thus the Hospitallers, or officials in
charge of the hospitals, became the knights of St. John, and the inmates
of the temple of Solomon, the knights Templar. The German hospitallers
also became transformed into an armed religious body that was called the
Teutonic order. Like both the others, this order soon acquired vast properties
in Europe, especially in Germany, and the emperor Frederick II raised
its grand-master to the rank of prince of the realm. In 1230 a Polish
prince made use of their zeal and arms, which could no longer be employed
in the Holy Land, by despatching them on a mission to subjugate and
convert the Prussians, a people who have since become so closely identified
with the Germans settled in the country as to be no longer distinguishable
from them. It was this idolatrous people, established between the Niemen
and the Vistula, whose language, history, and religion have now completely
disappeared, that gave its name to one of the largest and most prosperous
states of modern Europe.</p>

<p>The Teutonic order took up its station first at Kulm, whence it proceeded
to conquer the Prussians by the use of the means employed by Charlemagne
against the Saxons; that is, by destroying one portion of the population
and then building fortresses to contain the rest. It was this purpose that
Königsberg and Marienburg were intended to serve.</p>

<p>Several years earlier a prelate of Livonia had founded the order of the
Brothers of the Sword, known still as the knights of Christ, and the body
of the sword-bearers, which subdued Livonia and Esthonia. Disputes with
the bishops of Riga caused these organisations to unite in 1237 with the
Teutonic order, whose forces were thus doubled. Marienburg became
the capital of the order in 1309, and its grand-masters, who reigned over
Prussia, Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland, caused these countries to hold communion
with the rest of Europe, and planted in them the germs of civilisation.
They remain to-day the richest and most progressive of the Russian provinces.
As late as the fifteenth century the Teutonic knights retained the preponderance
of power in northern Europe, all the countries between the lower
Vistula and Lake Peipus being subject to them except Samogitia, a Lithuanian
province which separated the original possessions of the two orders.</p>

<h5>THE ATTACK ON THE ALBIGENSES</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1167-1208 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The crusade directed by Simon de Montfort against the populations of the
south of France was at first most disastrous in its effects. During all
the time that Christian warriors were being sent out to do battle with
miscreants at the opposite end of the Mediterranean Sea, many infidels were
awaiting conversion in the very heart of Europe. Not the Jews, who had
furnished the first cause for the Crusades in the fury with which they inspired
their early persecutors, but the mixed populations in the south of France,
composed of Iberians, Gauls, Romans, Goths, and Moors, whose religious
beliefs were far removed from orthodoxy. Just what name to give to their
heresy it is hard to decide; even contemporaries were at a loss in this respect
since they called the people simply Albigenses, from the town Albi, which
was their common centre. One thing only is certain&mdash;that in 1167 a council
was held near Toulouse, presided over by Nicetas, a Greek from Constantinople,
at which many oriental ideas were adopted; it has also been asserted
that ecclesiastics were treated with scorn in every part of the land, and even
St. Bernard himself was received there with derision. From this centre of
heresy missionaries were sent out in every direction, and already unseemly
doctrines were making themselves known in Flanders, Germany, England,
and even in Italy, while recently bands of marauders had spread out in the
direction of Auvergne, pillaging churches and profaning sacred objects.</p>

<p>Among the rich and brilliant cities of the south the most important was
Toulouse, where resided Count Raymond VI, one of the greatest nobles of
the south. Another prominent house was that of Barcelona, which had
lately obtained rule over Aragon and possessed Roussillon and Provence;
there were further the proud and adventurous nobles of the Pyrenees, who
lived free and independent lives, and owed not the least allegiance to either
church or king.</p>

<p>The south of France had long been separated from the north. Having
other customs and speaking a different tongue, it had made serious efforts
under Dagobert, Charles Martel, Pepin, Charlemagne, Charles the Bald, and
Hugh Capet, to constitute itself an independent state. Increase in commerce
had brought ease to its citizens and affluence to its nobles, and the two
classes united in peace and harmony to discharge municipal duties, thus
assuring the peace of the whole community. But in those wealthy cities and
brilliant courts, made gay by the songs of troubadours, religious doctrines
were accorded scant attention, and heresy leaked in from every side.</p>

<p>The all-powerful Innocent III resolved to stamp out this hotbed of impiety
that threatened to spread contagion far and wide. He began by
organising the Inquisition, which was to seek out and judge heretics, and
countless victims were immolated without in any way lessening the number
of unbelievers, the rack and the stake being but indifferent demonstrators of
the truth. The pope next sent to Raymond VI his legate, the monk Peter of
Castelnau, with the demand that the heretics be immediately expulsed. But
the heretics formed the main body of the population, and Castelnau accomplished
nothing. Raymond was excommunicated and threatened with
eternal fires, and the legate was murdered during his passage back over the
Rhone (1208).</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1208-1228 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>“Anathema on the count of Toulouse,” cried the pope, “and remission of
sins to all who will take up arms against these pestilent inhabitants of Provence!
Forward, soldiers of Christ! let the heretics be wiped out, and colonies
of Catholics spring up where their cities now stand!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span></p>

<p>The doctrine of extermination was preached by all the organs of the pope:
and the duke of Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, Auxerre, Geneva, the
bishops of Rheims, Sens, Rouen, Autun, with many Germans and inhabitants
of Lorraine, massed forces, and set out on the crusade. Three armies made
irruption into the south of France, headed by Simon de Montfort, a feudal
lord of the environs of Paris, ambitious, fanatical, and cruel. The count of
Toulouse was not immediately attacked, the pope hoping to weaken his resistance
by appearing ready to extend a pardon, and hostilities were all directed
against the viscount of Béziers. When the latter’s town was taken,
the victors, not being able to distinguish the heretics, hesitated whom to
strike. “Kill all,” said the legate, “God will easily recognise his own.”
Thirty thousand are said to have perished. Carcassonne also succumbed,
and the knights of the Ile de France divided up the country under Simon de
Montfort, who was made suzerain over all.</p>

<p>Raymond hoped to be spared, now that so sanguinary a sacrifice had been
offered up on the altar of orthodoxy, and Innocent himself was inclined to
clemency, but the legates were without pity; they would extend mercy to
the count only on condition that he should cause all his subjects to don the
garb of penitents, degrade his nobles to the state of villeins, discharge his
hired troops, raze his castles to the ground, and himself start on a crusade.</p>

<p>The count laughed at these proposals, and again the legates gave the signal
for attack. There flocked to the banner of Simon de Montfort a multitude
from the north, rejoicing that the highly profitable campaign in the
south was not yet at an end. Raymond VI was vanquished at Castelnaudry,
and the victors divided up his domains among themselves: to the prelates
fell the bishoprics, and to the soldiers the fiefs. The defeated noble had no
resource but to seek the protection of Pedro II, king of Aragon, who at once
advanced to the rescue, and was joined by all the petty nobles of the Pyrenees,
being looked upon by them as their chief.</p>

<p>The battle of Muret, in which the king perished, decided the fate of the
south of France (1213). Two years afterward the Council of Lateran ratified
the dispossession of Raymond and of most of the other nobles; the
legates of the holy see offered their fiefs to the powerful barons who had
participated in the crusade; but all save Simon de Montfort refused to accept
gifts bought at the price of so much bloodshed. A harsh measure was
passed, forbidding widows of heretics who possessed noble fiefs to marry any
but Frenchmen during the next ten years. In the grasp of hands so ruthless
the civilisation of southern France perished, and all gaiety and poesy
disappeared. Innocent III, meanwhile, began to be troubled, fearing to
have committed a great iniquity. “Give me back my lands,” the count de
Foix said to him, “or I shall claim all of you&mdash;property, rights, and heritage,
on the Day of Judgment.” “I acknowledge,” answered the pope, “that
great wrong has been done you; but it was not done by my order, and I
owe no thanks to those who are responsible.”</p>

<p>In their extremity the people of Languedoc bethought themselves of the
king of France. Montpellier gave itself up to him, and Philip Augustus sent
his son Louis to plant the national standard in the south of France. Louis
returned thither at the death of Simon de Montfort, who was killed before
Toulouse&mdash;whither Raymond VII, son of the old count, had also returned;
and Montfort’s successor, Amaury, offered to cede to the king his father’s
conquered possessions, which he could no longer defend against the reprobation
of the people. Philip, at that time on the brink of the grave, refused
the offer, but five years later it was accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span></p>

<h5>WESTERN ASSAULTS ON THE ARABS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[732-1096 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Before, during, and after the great Crusades which had the Orient for
their scene of action and all the peoples of Europe for their personages,
there was being carried on in the West another and smaller undertaking of
a similar nature, which won nothing like the renown attending the greater
expeditions, but which displayed a tenacity of purpose that kept it in operation
during at least eight centuries. When Charles Martel and Pepin le
Bref expelled the Arabs from France they simply drove them to the other
side of the Pyrenees, seeming to look upon that strong mountain barrier as
the confine of Europe and Christianity. Spain was a country to be sacrificed,
to be delivered over with Africa to the Moslem races by which it had been
invaded. Spain had been Christian, however, before the invasion, and the
mass of the people remained so after, by no means all having been subjected.
Outside the conquered districts there remained a point where the sacred
thought of independence could find safe harbour, and this point was gradually
to expand until it formed the nucleus of a new Christian domination.</p>

<p>The weakening of the power of the Cordovan caliphate in its northern
provinces, as a result of the revolt of the Beni Hassan in 864, was singularly
favourable to the development of the small Christian states. The tenth
century, however, did not continue to bring uninterrupted good fortune to
the Christian states. While discords were beginning to creep in among
their own number, the caliphate was restored by Abd ar-Rahman III, and
the adroit Al-Mansur under Hisham II. The terrible defeat suffered by the
Christians at Simancas in 940, the overthrow of Sancho the Great by the
count of Castile who declared himself independent, and the subsequent
reinstatement of Sancho by Abd ar-Rahman, reveal the kingdom of Leon as
having fallen into a state of demoralisation so deep that even its enemies had
power to dispose of the throne. Al-Mansur also weighed upon the Christians
with a ruthless hand. In 997 he found himself master of all the lands the
Christians had conquered south of the Douro and the Ebro. When he
came to be defeated himself, however, at Calatanazar, near the source of
the Douro, his chagrin was so great that he allowed himself to die by starvation,
and in him perished the mainstay of the caliphate (998).</p>

<p>We have seen at another point in this history that during the eleventh
century the Spanish Arabs fell into complete dissolution; the Christian
states, on the other hand, grew into closer and closer union by means of
frequent intermarriages and increased trade relations. This process of unification
and internal adjustment, as well as the necessity of closing all the
gaps left open by the sword of Al-Mansur, held in check the holy war for a
period of nearly a century. At the end of that time it was resumed with
greater brilliancy and success than before.</p>

<p>Not alone by reason of the fortunate alliances he was able to make did
Sancho II merit the title of Great; greatness was to be achieved in Spain
mainly by warring upon infidels, and many were the engagements during
which the Moors were made to feel the might of his sword. Not content to
rest here, he carried his victorious arms, in the intervals of preparing the
substitution of the Christian dynasty of Aznar for that of Pelayo, into
the heart of the Moslem country to the very walls of Cordova.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1072-1146 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>At Sancho’s death Spain was divided into four kingdoms. But Alfonso
VI reunited Castile and Leon in 1072, and resumed in Spain the holy war
which had been made extremely popular in Europe by the preparations for
the First Crusade. The news of the Christian reverses in Jerusalem, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
also the growing influence of the holy see, had a powerful effect on Spain.
It was the desire of Gregory VII to bring under his domination the Spanish
Christian states which had hitherto enjoyed complete religious independence,
and in case of their failure to yield it was feared that some day he would
arm all Christianity against them.</p>

<p>Always characterised by boundless presumption, Gregory VII demanded
of Alfonso VI that he pay him tribute, on the pretext that all lands taken
from the infidels were by right the property of the church. Alfonso refused.
Then Gregory fell back on another point, the adoption by the Spanish
Christians of the Roman instead of the Gothic or Muzarabic ritual to which
they had been used. Eventually Alfonso adopted the Roman ritual.
Henceforth complete communion was held with Rome by the Spanish people
which eventually became the most pronouncedly Catholic, if not always the
most submissive to the holy see, of all the races of the earth.</p>

<p>Ferdinand I had profited by the divisions existing among the petty Arab
sovereigns to wrest from them many of their possessions. He took Viseu,
Lamego, Coimbra, and made the king of Toledo pay him tribute. In 1085
Alfonso VI was even more successful, gaining possession of the entire kingdom.
Toledo, formerly the capital and metropolis of the Goths, became once
more an important centre; and its restoration marks the fourth stage of the
progress of the Christians from the Asturias, where they began their onward
march, to the heart of the peninsula, where they were to take up a firm
position behind the barrier of the Tagus.</p>

<p>Five years later the Capetian, Henri de Bourgogne, great-grandson of
Robert king of France, who had distinguished himself at the conquest
of Toledo, took at the mouth of the Douro, Porto Cale, which Alfonso raised
to importance by making it the countship of Portugal. Simultaneously with
this the famous Cid, Rodrigo de Bivar, the hero of Spanish chivalry and romance,
achieved victory after victory along the coast of the Mediterranean, the
most important of which was the conquest of Valencia (1094). Finally in
1118 Alfonso I, king of Aragon, won for himself a capital after the manner
of the king of Castile, by taking possession of Saragossa, where a Moslem
dynasty had long been in power. Thus the Christian invasion, divided like
an army into three columns, was steadily advancing across the peninsula, one
column in the centre, one in the east and one in the west.</p>

<p>In the centre progress was suddenly arrested, and was later checked
along all the lines by unforeseen obstacles which the Christians were unable
to surmount until after the lapse of nearly a century. Two new Moslem
hordes poured in upon the land, surprising the Spanish conquerors in the
midst of their belief that the sources of these invading tides had long since
been exhausted. The Almoravids, and after them the Almohads, swarmed
out of Africa and revived in the Moslem provinces of Spain the ancient faith
of Islam. The names of these two sects signify, respectively, “close alliance
with the faith,” and “Unitarians.” The Almoravids steadily increased their
power and the extent of their dominion. At the death of the Cid (1099)
they retook Valencia, gained possession of the Balearic Isles, and in 1108
won, in a battle as sanguinary and hard-fought as that of Zallaka, a signal
victory over Alfonso VI. The Christians asked themselves in alarm if
Spain, but half reconquered, was about to be wrested from them again.</p>

<p>As the result showed, their fears were groundless. Toledo, repeatedly
besieged, defended itself with victorious energy; and the little earldom of
Portugal not only successfully resisted attack, but itself took several towns
and drove the invaders back whence they had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[1146-1270 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The invasion of the Almohads was similar in its effects to that of the
Almoravids, which it immediately succeeded. The leader, Abdul-Mumin,
began hostilities by laying siege to Fez, which he took in 1146; the same year
he led his followers into Spain. As before, it was Castile that had to bear
the heaviest shock of the invasion, and at the battle of Alarcon (1195) Alfonso
VIII was badly defeated. Portugal, on the other hand, maintained
its superiority and placed a decided check upon the invaders at Santerem
(1184). The advancement made by Aragon and Portugal caused the thirteenth
century to open gloriously for Spain in its struggles against the Moslems.
It had, moreover, been given a second powerful instrument with
which to achieve victory in the four military bodies organised in the twelfth
century expressly for the Spanish Crusade, without prejudice to the great
Holy Land crusaders who also took part&mdash;the orders of Alcantara, of Calatrava,
and of St. James in Castile, and of Evora in Portugal.</p>

<p>In the year 1210 the news was spread throughout all Christendom that
four hundred thousand Almohads had crossed the Strait of Gibraltar.
Though deeply engaged in the war against the Albigenses, Pope Innocent
III could not contemplate the danger thus announced without calling
upon all Europe to succour Spain. Public prayers were ordered and indulgence
promised to all who would volunteer to fight in the peninsula.
The five Christian kings of Leon and Castile, temporarily separated at the
time, joined their forces and marched against Muhammed, the fanatical
leader of the Almohads. The encounter took place at Alacab, on the plateau
of the Sierra Morena, according to the Arabs; at Las Navas de Tolosa, according
to the Christians. After an obstinately contested battle the flight of the
Andalusians decided the day in favour of the Christians. Muhammed, who
had stationed himself on a height amid the serried ranks of his African guard,
holding the <i>Koran</i> in one hand and his sword in the other, looked on in
undisturbed passivity while his followers suffered the most terrible defeat.
“God alone,” he said, “is just and powerful, the demon is without truth or
greatness.” Muhammed was at last compelled to take flight on a swift
courser of the desert, which carried him far from his enemies. This battle
was decisive in the struggles between the Christians and the infidels. The
Almoravids and Almohads once definitely repulsed, there rose up in Africa
no more defenders of the Moslem faith sufficiently powerful to restore its
dominion in Spain.</p>

<p>During the whole of the thirteenth century the Christians reaped the
fruits of their victory, which was rendered the more complete by the anarchy
that prevailed among all ranks of the Almohads. Cordova (1236), Seville
(1266), and many other places fell into the hands of the king of Castile,
while James I, king of Aragon, brought the Balearic Isles under subjection,
and at the head of eighty thousand French and Spanish troops retook Valencia
(1238). Portugal reached its limit of expansion when in 1270 it united
the provinces of Algarve, and the outlines it then assumed have never since
been changed. The Moors now possessed only the little kingdom of Granada,
that was hemmed in on all sides by the sea and the domains of the king of
Castile. Yet even in this confined space, their numbers swelled by the refugees
that fled to them from the cities captured by the Christians, they contrived
to maintain a power that staved off their ultimate downfall for a period
of two hundred years. Save to repel certain incursions on the part of the
Merinids of Maghreb which never seriously endangered their conquered possessions,
the Christians had now no military operations to carry on; hence
the crusade in Spain was practically suspended until a later date, 1492.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span></p>

<h5>COMPARISON OF THE TWO CRUSADES</h5>

<p>The crusade to Jerusalem had undoubtedly brought forth general results
to civilisation, but its particular aim had not been accomplished. It founded
no important institutions in the Orient; it did not even succeed in delivering
the Holy Sepulchre, and millions of men had left their bones along its
route. The crusade in Spain, on the other hand, while it bore no consequences
to the social conditions of Europe in the Middle Ages, changed the
whole face of Spain and reacted powerfully upon the Europe of modern times.
It took the peninsula away from the Moors and gave it to the Christians; it
brought into being the little kingdom of Portugal which, carrying on a crusade
of its own beyond seas, discovered the Cape of Good Hope; and it made
great states of Aragon and Castile, whose kings were inspired with European
ambitions by their victories in Spain, and whose inhabitants gained, in the
eight centuries of warfare, military customs and knowledge which made of
them the <i>condottieri</i> of Charles V and Philip II, not the peaceful and industrious
heirs of the commerce and brilliant civilisation of the Moors.</p>

<p>There was still another point. What was the cause of this difference
between the two crusades? Jerusalem, situated far from the centre of
Catholic denomination, remained in the hands of the Moslems, by whom it
was surrounded, for precisely the same reason that Toledo, situated at the
limit of their zone of occupation, escaped them to become the possession of
the nearby Christians. The whole matter was simply a question of distance.
Palestine bordered on the territory of Mecca, as Spain lay in full view of
Rome. Geographical relationship is a powerful factor, even in matters that
seem to come the least under its influence&mdash;the theories and doctrines
of religion.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_6e"><a href="#crusades_endnote_6e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>FOOTNOTES</h5>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> It was very seldom that the Christians thought of converting the Mussulmans. When
the sword failed, then they resorted to arguments. The occasion will excuse us from departing
from chronological order, and saying, that in the year 1285, Pope Honorius IV in his design to
convert the Saracens to Christianity, wished to establish schools at Paris for the tuition of people
in the Arabic and other oriental languages, agreeably to the intentions of his predecessors. In
every subsequent project for a crusade, it was always proposed to instruct the Saracens sword in
hand. The Council of Vienne in 1312 recommended the conversion of the infidels, and the
re-establishment of schools, as the way to recover the Holy Land. It was accordingly ordered
that there should be professors of the Hebrew, Chaldaic, and Arabic tongues in Rome, Paris,
Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca; and that the learned should translate into Latin the best
Arabic books. It was not till the time of Francis I that this decree was acted upon. He founded
the royal college, and sent even into the East for books.</p>

her milk. His stubborn subjects said that they would tarry for his company till midsummer, and
no longer. Thus they weighed out their obedience with their own scales; and the king stood to
their allowance. But hearing of the ill success of the French, both prince and people altered
their resolution, who had come too late to help the French in their distress, and too soon to bring
themselves into the same misery.”</p>

<h4 id="CRUSADES_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII. CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRUSADES</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1096-1291 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>No religious wars have ever been so long, so sanguinary, and so destructive
as the Crusades. Countless hosts of holy warriors fell the victims of
their own vindictive enthusiasm and military ardour. Fierceness and intolerance
were the strongest features in the character of the dark ages, and
it is, perhaps, not so much in the conduct, as in the object, of the Crusades,
that anything distinct and peculiar can be marked. It was not for the conversion
of people, nor the propagation of opinions, but for the redemption of
the sepulchre of Christ, and the destruction of the enemies of God, that the
crimson standard was unfurled. The western world did not cast itself into
Asia from any view of expediency, or in consequence of any abstract theoretical
principle of a right of hostility; men did not arm themselves from
any conviction that the co-existence of Christendom and Islamism was compatible
with the doctrines of the <i>Koran</i>, or that the countries of the West
would be precipitated into the gulf of destruction, if Asia Minor were not
torn from the Seljuk Turks, and restored to the emperor of Constantinople.
But the flame of war spread from one end of Europe to the other, for the
deliverance of the Holy Land from a state which was called pollution; and
the floodgates of fanaticism were unlocked for the savage and iniquitous purpose
of extermination. But popular madness would not listen to the calls
of generous policy and lofty ambition. The wish for the redemption of the
Holy Land was the feeling which influenced both Godfrey de Bouillon and
St. Louis, the first and last great champions of the cross; it was that wild
desire which moved Europe for two centuries, and without it the Crusades
would never have been undertaken.</p>

<p>The question of the justice of the holy wars is one of easy solution. The
crusaders were not called upon by heaven to carry on hostilities against
the Mussulmans. Palestine did not, of right, belong to the Christians in
consequence of any gift of God; and it was evident, from the fact of the
destruction of the second temple, that there was no longer any peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
sanctity in the ground of Jerusalem. There is no command in the Scriptures
for Christians to build the walls of the Holy City, and no promise of an earthly
Canaan as the reward of virtue. If the Christians had been animated by the
conviction that war with all the world was the vital principle of the Mohammedan
religion, then also a right of hostility would have been raised.</p>

<p>As Lord Bacon said in his <i>War with Spain</i>: “Forasmuch as it is a fundamental
law in the Turkish empire, that they may, without any other provocation,
make war upon Christendom for the propagation of their law; so
that there lieth upon Christians a perpetual fear of war, hanging over their
heads, from them; and therefore, they may at all times, as they think good,
be upon the preventive.” But before they could have been justified on
this last-mentioned argument, proof was necessary that the danger was imminent,
and that time and circumstances had not reduced the principle to a
mere dry, inoperative letter of the law. In the first hundred and fifty years
of Mohammedan history, the Mussulmans made continued and successful
attacks on the Christians; and the invasion of France by the Spanish and
African Moors, seemed to endanger Christendom as a world independent of
and not tributary to the Saracens. In all that long period the people of the
West might have instituted crusades on principles of self-defence. But as
they had acquiesced for ages in the existence of Islam, they could not afterwards
draw the sword, except for the purpose of preventing or repelling
new aggressions. No dangers hung over Christendom at the time when the
Crusades commenced.</p>

<h5>MORAL EFFECTS</h5>

<p>On principles of morals and politics the holy wars cannot be justified.
Yet war became a sacred duty, and obligatory on every class of mankind.
The fair face of religion was besmeared with blood, and heavenly attraction
was changed for demoniacal repulsiveness. The Crusades encouraged the
most horrible violences of fanaticism. They were the precedent for the military
contentions of the church with the Prussians and Albigenses; and as the
execrable Inquisition arose out of the spirit of clerical dragooning, the wars in
Palestine brought a frightful calamity on the world. Universal dominion
was the ambition of the Roman pontiffs; and the iniquity of the means was
in dreadful accordance with the audacity of the project. The pastors of
the church used anathemas, excommunications, interdicts, and every weapon
in the storehouse of spiritual artillery; and when the world was in arms for
the purpose of destroying infidels, it was natural that the soldiers of God
should turn aside and chastise other foes to the true religion. Crusades with
idolaters and erring Christians were considered as virtuous and as necessary
as crusades with Saracens; the south of France was saturated with heretical
blood; and those booted apostles, the Teutonic knights, converted, sword in
hand, the Prussians and Lithuanians from idolatry to Christianity.</p>

<p>The sword of religious persecution was not directed against Turks and
heretics only. The reader remembers the sanguinary enormities that
disgraced the opening of the First Crusade. Not only was this instance
of persecution of the Jews the earliest one upon record in the annals of the
West since the fall of the Roman Empire, but it is also true that that
wretched people met with most of their dreadful calamities during the time
of the holy wars. It is highly probable that the hatred which the Christians
felt against them was embittered by that fierce and mistaken zeal for religion
which gave birth to the Crusades; and as the chief object of those Crusades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
was the recovery of the sepulchre at Jerusalem, it was natural that the
Christian belligerents should behold with equal detestation the nation which
had crucified the Saviour and the nation which continued to profane his tomb.
This conjecture is much confirmed by the circumstance, that the prevailing
prejudice in the Middle Ages against the Jews was that they often crucified
Christian children in mockery of the great sacrifice. If it be objected to this
reasoning that the crusading Cœur de Lion befriended the Jews, we reply
that the crusading king Edward I expelled them from England.</p>

<p>The penalties which the church inflicted on its members, as the temporal
punishments of sin, might have been unwarranted by Scripture, and were
doubtless often awarded by cruelty and caprice. But the practice of prayer,
fasting, and alms-giving, was in itself salubrious to the individual, and
beneficial to society. It softened pride; it subdued the sensual passions; it
diffused charity. Instead of these blessings, the slaughter of human beings
was made the propitiation of offence; and the Christian virtues of self-denial
and benevolence were considered an absurd and antiquated fashion. As the
discipline of the church had been broken in upon for one purpose, it could
be violated for another. The repentant sinner who could not take the cross
himself, might contribute to the charge of the holy expedition. When
offences were once commuted for money, the religious application of the
price of pardon soon ceased to be necessary. Absolutions from penance
became a matter of traffic, and holy virtues were discountenanced. For this
reason, and for many others, the Crusades conferred no benefits on morals.
The evils of a life free from domestic restraints, formed a strong argument
against pilgrimages in very early ages of the church, and it does not appear
that when the wanderers became soldiers their morals improved. The vices
of the military colonists in Palestine are the burden of many a page of the
crusading annalists. Something must be detracted from those representations
in consequence of their authors’ prejudice that the vices of the Christians
in the Holy Land effected the ruin of the kingdom. Yet enough
remains to show that the tone of morals was not at a higher pitch in Palestine
than in Europe. The decrees of the council at Nablus (Shechem or Neapolis)
prove that a difference of religion, although a barrier against the dearest
charities of life, was no impediment to a vicious sensual intercourse between
the Franks and the Moslems. The Latins lived in a constant course of
plunder on their Mussulman neighbours, and therefore on their return to
Europe could not spread around them any rays of virtue.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<h5>POLITICAL EFFECTS</h5>

<p>As the Crusades were carried on for holy objects, not for civil or national
ends, their connection with politics could only have been collateral and
indirect. The spirit of crusading, composed as it was of superstition and military
ardour, was hostile to the advancement of knowledge and liberty; and
consequently no improvement in the civil condition of the kingdoms of the
West could have been the legitimate issue of the principles of the holy wars.
The pope was the only monarch who mixed politics with his piety. The other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
princes seem to have been influenced by the spirit of religion or of chivalry;
and it was only in the attempts again to disorder the intellect of Europe, that
we find one monarch, Henry IV of England, acting the part of a crafty
politician.</p>

<p>Great changes in the political aspect of Europe were coeval with but
were not occasioned by the holy wars. The power of the French crown
was much higher at the end of the thirteenth, than it had been at the same
period of the eleventh century; but the influence of the imperial throne was
materially depressed. These opposite effects could never have been the simple
results of the same cause; namely, the loss of the flower of the western
aristocracy in Palestine.</p>

<p>The causes of the depression of imperial authority were the aggrandisement
of the nobles (a natural effect of the feudal system); the improvident
grants of lands which the Swabian family made to the clergy; the contests
between the popes and emperors respecting their different jurisdictions, and,
above all the rest, the destructive wars which
the emperors waged in the north of Italy
for the reannexation of that country to the
throne of the descendants of the imperial
house of Charlemagne.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">German Crusader of the Early Crusades</span></p>
</div>

<p>The political changes in England cannot
with justice be attributed to the Crusades.
Until the days of Richard I holy wars had
not become a general or a national concern.
The monarchy stood the same at the close
of his reign as at its commencement; and
the only favourable issue of Cœur de Lion’s
armament was an increase of military reputation.
His renunciation of feudal sovereignty
over Scotland had no influence on
politics. Edward I pressed his claim, although
Richard had deprived him of his
strongest support. The pusillanimous John
assumed the cross; but that circumstance
did not occur until after he had surrendered
his crown to the papal see, and until the
barons had formed a confederacy against
him. His assumption of the cross neither
retarded nor accelerated the progress of English
liberty. The pope was not linked to
him by stronger ties than those which had
formerly bound them; and the barons were
not deceived by the religious hypocrisy of
the king. The transmarine expeditions of the earls of Cornwall and Salisbury,
and of Prince Edward in the reign of Henry III, were the ebullitions
of religious and military ardour, but did not affect the general course of
events.</p>

<p>The great political circumstance of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
which was important above all others to civil liberty, was the appearance
of free and corporate towns. But the Crusades neither produced their
establishment nor affected their history. After various vicissitudes of
fortune, the battle of Legnano, and the Peace of Constance, established the
independence of the towns in the north of Italy. The Crusades did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
contribute to these events; for the two sacred expeditions which had taken
place were as disastrous to peasants as to princes, and drained Europe of
all ranks of society. Consequently it was not from the holy wars that the
people gained their liberties. We find that so ill regulated was the liberty
of the towns alluded to, that anarchy soon succeeded. Men of personal importance
and wealth aspired to sovereign honours; an overwhelming aristocracy
extinguished freedom, and at the end of the thirteenth century there
were as many princes in Tuscany and Lombardy as there had been free
towns at the end of the twelfth.</p>

<p>It is only in the maritime cities of Italy that any indisputable influence
of the Crusades can be marked. Trade with the Christian states in Palestine,
and the furnishing of transports to the pilgrims, increased the wealth
of the commercial cities. The capture of Constantinople by the French
and Venetians was important in its issues. Venice regained maritime
ascendency; but it was soon taken from her by the Genoese, who aided
the Greeks to recover their capital. Genoa then became a leading power
in the Mediterranean, and she subdued Pisa. The rapid increase of the
wealth and power of Venice and Genoa, and the eventual destruction of Pisa
seem, then, to form the principal circumstances in commercial history which
the Crusades were instrumental in producing. But how insignificant were
these events, both locally and generally, both in their relation to Italy and
to the general history of Europe, when compared with the discovery of a
maritime passage to India!</p>

<p>A view of the heroic ages of Christianity, in regard to their grand and
general results, is a useful and important, though a melancholy employment.
The Crusades retarded the march of civilisation, thickened the
clouds of ignorance and superstition; and encouraged intolerance, cruelty,
and fierceness. Religion lost its mildness and charity; and war its mitigating
qualities of honour and courtesy. Such were the bitter fruits of the
holy wars!<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_7c"><a href="#crusades_endnote_7c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>INFLUENCE UPON COMMERCE</h5>

<p>Trade with the East, at that time, embraced many more articles of commerce
than at the present day. Sugar and several other commodities sought
for as luxuries or used as medicine, which now come entirely from the new
world, were brought from Egypt or the Indies. Europeans looked to Asia for
precious gems, especially emeralds, whose worth equalled that of diamonds,
until the discovery of the rich mines in the mountains of America. Pearls
were then to be found only on the shores of oriental seas. The Crusades gave
the peoples of Europe a taste for delicacies and Asiatic ornaments, which
several of them had never before known. Vanity and enervation made
precious stones, silks, perfumes, and all the products less useful than pleasant
which nature has sown in profusion throughout the Orient, necessary to them.</p>

<p>Accustomed by their intercourse with the Orientals to the burning
savour of spices, soon they were not able to get along without them. They
could not prepare famous dishes without plentiful use of spice; wines even
were perfumed with them. Romancers of the era of the Crusades sang the
praises, on nearly every page, of cinnamon, musk, clove, and ginger. Did
these writers praise some exquisite odour, it was with spices they compared
it. Did their fertile imagination build some superb palace, the magic home
of the most powerful genii, they surrounded it with an odoriferous forest,
planted with spice-bearing trees. Several Italian towns, especially the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
republics of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, got from this, almost entirely, not only
the benefits of a commerce which embraced so many sought-for commodities,
but the other advantages of a sea-trade abandoned to the Franks, by the
Greeks and Arabs.</p>

<h5>ENRICHMENT OF CITIES</h5>

<p>Venice, who nourished amid her waters an enormous population, seems
through her natural environment to have been peopled only with merchants
and followers of the sea. The Crusades helped the proud city to the
accomplishment of her brilliant destiny, to make the Orient tremble at her
fleets, to enrich the Occident by her industry, and to command respect
through many ages for her military power. Genoa, less happily situated,
and less rich than Venice, was, however, powerful enough to have aroused
the Sea-Republic’s jealousy. Pisa had pushed herself too late into rivalry
with Genoa, and the destruction of her harbour was the work of implacable
Genoese hatred. Florence, never free from the throes of civil discord,
obtained nevertheless great wealth from her commerce, which she generously
consecrated to the culture of the fine arts.</p>

<p>The Crusades, therefore, enriched the great cities in giving the opportunity
to extend their trade, and also to raise to exorbitant prices charges
for their ships. The hardships and dangers which were inseparable from the
overland route made it less and less frequented after the first expeditions.
Crowds of pilgrims made their way to the ports, and several Italian
republics amassed, in the transportation of human freight, a degree of
wealth comparable for that time to that which the merchandise of the
new world had since brought to the most flourishing cities of modern
days.</p>

<h5>COLONISATION</h5>

<p>The establishment of colonies in the East gave more substantial foundation
to Italy’s prosperity. Several cities, whose own interest was a constant
stimulus, and whose industry grew with success, founded trading colonies
in Egypt, Africa, throughout the kingdom of Jerusalem; at Tyre, where
the Pisans had formed a celebrated commercial group; at Antioch, at Acre,
stronghold of the Christians; at several other places which the Crusades
had opened to them; and as a result the principal cause of the decline of
Venice and other powerful Italian cities was not alone the discovery of the
Cape of Good Hope, but to some extent the conquests which made Selim I
master of Egypt.</p>

<p>Before the days of the holy wars, some of the Italian towns already
possessed trading stations in the Greek Empire, but Constantinople having
fallen into the hands of the Latins, the active spirit of the Italians was no
longer disturbed by the defiant policy of the Eastern emperors. The Genoese
founded the colony of Kaffa, which became very prosperous; the Venetians
and Pisans multiplied their warehouses in many places. The subjects
of the doge, always mindful of their commerce, demanded the islands of
the archipelago, in dividing with the French the territory wrested from the
Eastern Empire; but at the moment of taking possession of their share they
feared to weaken themselves by occupying territory so remote and widely
separated. In the end, however, they could not bring themselves to let
go a maritime country so well adapted to trade, and the senate invited by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
proclamation the rich citizens to take possession of these isles, promising to
give in fief those they succeeded in making subject to themselves. Thus it
happened that the descendants of the Greeks once so jealous of their political
independence saw, so to speak, their freedom at the auction block in the
public squares of Venice.</p>

<p>And thus it was that the Crusades ruined the Greeks and the Arabs, and
that traffic between the East and the West had to pass almost exclusively
through the hands of the Italians, then called Lombards, active, sharp
merchants and pitiless usurers, who have left their names as a monument to
their thrift, upon the commercial streets of many a great town; those
localities where the money lender, furnishing more often a passing aid to
extravagance than real assistance to misery, exhibits his insatiable greed.
They tried, in the twelfth century, to create merchant tribunals in several
towns, to decide commercial disputes and make treaties with strangers&mdash;the
first separation of commercial jurisprudence from common law. We
shall be forgiven doubtless for not entering into any minute description of
the Italian commercial establishments in Greece and Asia; it has been
sufficient to note the turn given by the Crusades to trade in general.</p>

<p>The flourishing condition to which Venice, Genoa, and Pisa in the south
of Europe were raised by trade with the East was almost equalled in the
north by that of the Hanseatic towns. Necessary commodities for use at
sea, all the products of colder climes, offered to the Teutonic Hansa large
and assured profits. As the Lombards brought into parts of Germany where
money was scarce the products of the south and east, there sprang up an
exchange of merchandise for merchandise. The Hanseatic League apparently
came into existence about the beginning of the thirteenth century, and it is
not hard to believe that the commercial activity stimulated by the Crusades
favoured the formation of the powerful federation which breathed nothing
but the love of gain, and which bartered for all the wealth of the south
with all the product of the north.</p>

<p>In infusing into trade a new activity, the Crusades necessarily perfected
the art of navigation. We may well admit that the sea held less of terror
for one who confronted it to perform a religious duty, and insensibly
this fear-inspiring element became less regarded as the inevitable tomb of all
who confided to it their life or fortune. Moreover vessels ceased to be
guided by blind instinct or the insufficient experience of pilots. The compass,
whose origin it is so difficult to establish (and indeed the instrument
may not have been invented before the time of the First Crusade), was in
general use on the ships that plied the Mediterranean. We must admire
the fortunate but rash industry of the Italians who overcame the caprices
and fury of the waves. These navigators gained experience more and more
in constantly transporting pilgrims, and proved that it was not impossible
to sail the seas in winter. Venice surpassed the whole world in the brilliance
of her maritime glory. She well deserved that a pope of this period, zealous
to show his gratitude to his defenders, presented the doge, with solemn ceremony,
the wedding ring which was for long ages the unique emblem of the
republic’s naval power.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p474.jpg" width="150" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Crusader of the Last Crusade</span></p>
</div>

<p>Other fleets than those of Italy found their way to the Holy Land. One
might see on the Southern Sea vessels carrying those pirates and adventurers
which set out every year in great numbers from the countries in the north,
the Flemings, the Dutch, the Swedes, the Danes often rendered considerable
assistance to the Christians in the East. Norwegians fought under King
Baldwin at the taking of Sidon; the Flemings rescued Lisbon from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
Saracens. These northern people came in high-decked massive ships, while
the vessels in use on the Mediterranean were very light and shallow affairs;
a difference in structure which could not be noticed without a comparison
of advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>From the Crusades may be dated the establishment of the French navy.
Philip Augustus, on his return from the Holy Land, organised a national
fleet; before this the French fleets were composed of foreign vessels hired
for a certain time. The title of “admiral,” of which
the name and idea was borrowed from the Greeks
or the Arabs, came into constant use about the time of
the Second Crusade, whereas the rank was never bestowed
in former days except at the commencement
of a war, and went out of use at its close.</p>

<p>Very soon the ocean and the Mediterranean were
covered with vessels manned by prudent and intrepid
sailors. The great overland route from Antwerp to
Genoa, which was expensive, slow, and difficult, was
thenceforth given up.</p>

<p>Naval architecture learned a lesson from several
abuses which the Crusades momentarily had introduced
into the art. Ships of excessive capacity, too weak,
and of faulty proportions had been hastily built in
order to accommodate the crowd of pilgrims. Seamen
who wished their voyages to be more lucrative and
passengers desirous of travelling in companies began
to adopt these ungainly vessels. However, this departure
from the principles of shipbuilding caused the
loss of many fleets and brought about a fortunate innovation
in naval architecture. Experience taught that
a single mast was not sufficient in a vessel of great size,
and we may trace to this period the custom of furnishing
several masts to a single ship&mdash;a custom whose
antiquity is well proven, but whose origin is somewhat
shadowed in doubt.</p>

<p>An increase in the number of sails must of necessity
follow the adoption of more than one mast; ships were
no longer stopped in their course for lack of a directly
favourable wind,&mdash;by trimming the sails with skill the
seaman progressed nearly always towards his destination. The art of sailing
for a certain point with the wind nearly dead ahead must certainly be counted
as one of the most ingenious and important discoveries ever made.</p>

<h5>INFLUENCE ON INDUSTRY</h5>

<p>The same causes which gave a new activity to commerce served to
develop powerfully every resource of industry. At the time of the first
Crusades there were no manufactories of silken stuffs but those of the
Greeks, a species of industry they had taken from the Persians, but which
they themselves were soon forced to give over to Sicily. Then artisans leaving
the island taught the Italians the art of making silk. The industry
occupied principally the members of the religious order of the Humilies, who
invented, it is said, cloth of gold and of silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span></p>

<p>In the cities of the Orient the Saracens, also, had manufactures of goods,
and from them the crusaders bought textile fabrics of camels’ hair. These
industries and those of the Greeks, whether the latter was transported to
Palermo or remained in the Eastern Empire, were able to serve as models
or as incentive, in Europe, to many establishments where wool was worked.
There were some famous glass manufactories at Tyre. The sand which
covers the environs of that town has the property of giving a high degree
of transparence to the vitrified matter from which beautiful shapes were
fashioned. These productions excited probably the emulation of Venice
who drew great profit from her glassware, particularly in the fifteenth century
when the use of metal vessels was abandoned for that of glass. Here
are some particulars about inventions, the only ones we have been able to
gather. Mills, whose motive power is wind, were invented in Asia Minor
where running water is very scarce. It has been supposed that the crusaders
introduced them into Europe in the twelfth century&mdash;a conjecture
which would seem to be confirmed by the application of parts of windmills
on a great number of old armorial bearings, but which certain other evidence
does not permit us to adopt. Several writers have also presumed
that the crusaders spread a knowledge of the invention of paper, which they
had derived from the Greeks, throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The Arabs excelled at metal working and they knew how to chase and
encrust it. They invented the art of “damascening,” which gave to steel
the brilliance and splendour of gold and silver. Antiquaries have observed
that since the Crusades the stamping of coins and the imprint of seals seem
less incorrect and some attribute this improvement to lessons learned from
the Arabs. The crusaders, however indignant at the profanation of the
Temple of Jerusalem, could not but admire the ornamentation of precious
metals by which the columns and walls had been artistically treated in honour
of Mohammed. They brought away with them more than five hundred
silver vessels consecrated to the service of the false prophet. The process
of enamelling metals and the use in painting of solid, bright colours may
have been brought to perfection by the sight of these Arabian works of art.
They also brought back from the Orient a quantity of rubies, hyacinths,
emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds, and they found out how to set them in
gold and silver, so as to give an undying charm through the taste of their
mounting and their setting.</p>

<h5>THE MASONS ORGANISE</h5>

<p>The Crusades contributed indirectly to the progress of art in that they
caused religious orders and devout establishments to be multiplied. The
number of sacred edifices which rose up at that time throughout Europe is
truly prodigious. Nobles and even those who had little piety were ambitious
for the title of “founder of a church.” While they may have wrecked
temples in one place, it was often their pleasure to build them in others.</p>

<p>One extraordinary circumstance greatly favoured this eagerness to erect
edifices devoted to the religious cult. In France, in Italy especially, it had
been common rumour that the world was nearing its end and it was thought
unnecessary, in this event, to repair churches, and even more useless to build
new ones. But when the predicted period arrived and there were no signs
of the final catastrophe, alarm diminished, and ashamed to have been misled
by pusillanimous fear, people were anxious to make amends for the neglect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
of altars and sacred places of which they had been guilty. They were not
satisfied to pay their debt to religion by rebuilding unsafe churches, but
those of whose stability there was no question were torn down on the specious
pretext that they were not sufficiently magnificent. To accomplish
their aims a society was formed composed of men of every degree, noble
and humble, who made themselves in their devotion into carpenters and
masons; they offered their services in every direction, hauling carts like
beasts of burden or binding themselves to certain religious devotions. The
cathedral of Chartres is a monument of the labour of these pious workmen.
These strange ideas having been developed towards the end of the eleventh
century, the Crusades found in men’s minds a passion for this sort of construction,
and they added to the general enthusiasm.</p>

<h5>GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE</h5>

<p>Several monuments of architecture which still excite our admiration are
the fruit of the artistic impulse received from contact with people more
devoted to its culture and from the growing fervour of devotion. The sight
of Greek and Arab monuments introduced into the West a new taste by
which that Syrian, Arab, or Saracen type of architecture, improperly called
Gothic, was brought to its highest degree of perfection. Delicately pointed
ogive arches replaced the low and ugly openings which timid builders were
afraid to raise higher and which presented but narrow outlooks to view.
Architects were judged skilful as they were able to astonish by the boldness
and daring of their own work. As in the mosques, they loaded upon light and
graceful columns enormous masses which seemed upheld by the support of an
invisible arm. They cut stones into a thousand different and often most
fanciful forms, and set into them painted glass whose brilliant colours were
admirably brought out by the rays of the sun. And as if they foresaw the
indifference of posterity to their work, they gave it a solidity which has
enabled it to go for great lengths of time without care and restoration.</p>

<p>At that time appeared the most magnificent offsprings of Gothic architecture.
Then was built the leaning tower of Pisa, which has become a
marvel through the injury of time. A Greek architect built at Venice the
church of St. Mark, strongly impressed with the degenerate taste of the
Greeks. A German conceived the plan of the tower of Strasburg, whose
delicate structure seems unable to hold it so high in the air. Suger did not
disdain to study architecture; he restored his own abbey church and left an
account of his labours. The foundations of Amiens, masterpiece of bold
and delicate construction, were laid. La Sainte Chapelle at Paris, less vast
but equally delicate in style, was the finest work of the favourite architect
whom St. Louis took with him to Asia. We should go on at too great a
length were we to enumerate all the superb edifices built in the glorious age
of Gothic architecture. Barbaric, perhaps, in ornamentation, these artists
have never been equalled in principle, in general design, stone-cutting, in
knowledge of arching, and in the majesty of their edifices as a whole.</p>

<h5>SCULPTURE AND PAINTING</h5>

<p>Sculpture made these temples alive with a host of statues. It has preserved
for us the images of many famous men, whose portraits, drawn from
nature, we often regret not to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span></p>

<p>Painting was cultivated with greater zeal. Cimabue developed his happy
faculties at Florence according to the teaching of some artists from Constantinople.
He was the first to show what wonders one could expect from an
almost forgotten art, and it is right that he should be placed at the head of
all the painters that have appeared since his time.</p>

<p>From what has been said it is certain that the Crusades helped to infuse
into the West a taste for painting, sculpture, and architecture. The spirit
of conquest has always awakened that of the fine arts. Though artists may
flee from the clash of arms, their souls, inspired by the commotion of great
warlike movements and the general emulation of courage and valour, exhibit
at such time a noble ambition for glory. The aspect of the theatre of desolation
and carnage, swept by the conqueror’s tread, kindles often the sacred
fire, which is extinguished in times of peace and tranquillity, and marvellous
productions, conceived and matured in deep thought, quickly follow the
imperfect and hastily finished sketch. Nations also wish to celebrate, by
public monuments, triumphs watered with their blood and tears. For this
reason painters display on heroes’ heads the wings of victory, are lavish with
palm and crown, and place on every side the emblems of fame. Cities
become filled with superb buildings, and public squares peopled with folk of
bronze and marble who seem to live and breathe.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_7e"><a href="#crusades_endnote_7e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>HERDER’S OPINION OF THE CRUSADES</h5>

<p>It has been customary to ascribe so many beneficial effects to the Crusades,
that, conformably to this opinion, our quarter of the globe must require a similar
fever, to agitate and excite its forces, once in every five or six centuries;
but a closer inspection will show that most of these effects proceeded not from
the Crusades, at least not from them alone; and that among the various
impulses Europe then received, they were at most accelerating shocks, acting
upon the whole in collateral or oblique directions, with which the minds of
Europeans might well have dispensed. Indeed it is a mere phantom of the
brain to frame one prime source of events out of seven distinct expeditions,
undertaken in a period of two centuries, by different nations, and from
various motives, solely because they bore one common name.</p>

<p>Trade the Europeans had already opened with the Arabian states, before
the Crusades: and they were at liberty to have profited by it, and extended
it, in a far more honourable way than by predatory campaigns. By these,
indeed, carriers, bankers, and purveyors were gainers: but all their gain
accrued from the Christians, against whose property they were in fact the
crusaders. What was torn from the Greek Empire was a disgraceful traders’
booty, serving, by extremely enfeebling this empire, to render Constantinople
an easier prey at a future period to the Turkish hordes, who were continually
pressing more closely upon it. The Venetian Lion of St. Mark prepared
the way, by the Fourth Crusade, for the Turks to enter Europe and spread
themselves so widely in it. The Genoese, it is true, assisted one branch of the
Greek emperors to re-ascend the throne: but it was the throne of a weakened,
broken empire, which fell an easy prey to the Turks; then both the
Venetians and Genoese lost their best possessions, and finally almost all their
trade, in the Mediterranean and Euxine seas.</p>

<p>Chivalry arose not from the Crusades, but the Crusades from chivalry:
the flower of French and Norman knighthood appeared in Palestine in the
first campaign. The Crusades, indeed, contributed rather to rob chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
of its proper honours, and to convert real armed knights into mere armorial
ones. For in Palestine many assumed the crested helmet, which in Europe
they durst not have borne: they brought home with them armorial devices
and nobility, which they transmitted to their families, and thus introduced
a new class, the nobility of the herald’s office, and in time also nobility by
letters patent. As the number of the ancient dynasties, the true equestrian
nobility, lessened, these new men sought to obtain possessions and hereditary
prerogatives, like them: they carefully enumerated their ancestors, acquired
dignities and privileges, and in a few generations assumed the title of ancient
nobility; though they had not the slightest pretensions to rank with those
dynasties which were princes to them. Every man that bore arms in Palestine
might become a knight: the first Crusades were years of general jubilee
for Europe. These new nobles in right of military service were soon of great
use to growing monarchy, which cunningly knew how to avail itself of them
against such of the superior vassals as still remained. Thus passion balances
passion, and one appearance counteracts another: and at length the nobility
of the camp and the court totally obliterated the ancient chivalry.</p>

<p>The arts and sciences, too, were nowise promoted by the proper crusaders.
The disorderly troops that first flocked to Palestine had not the least notion
of them; and were not likely to acquire them in the suburbs of Constantinople,
or from the Turks and mamelukes in Asia. In the succeeding campaigns
we need not reflect on the short time the armies passed there, and
the wretched circumstances under which this time was often spent merely
on the confines of the country, to dissipate the splendid dream of great discoveries
imported thence. The pendulum clock, which the emperor Frederick
II received as a present from Kamil, did not introduce gnomonics into
Europe; the Grecian palaces, which the crusaders admired in Constantinople,
did not improve the style of European architecture. Some crusaders, particularly
Frederick I and II, laboured to promote the progress of knowledge: but
Frederick I did this ere he beheld Asia; and the short visit paid that country
by Frederick II served only as a fresh stimulus to urge him forward in that
course of government which he had long before chosen. Not one of the
spiritual orders of knighthood introduced any new knowledge into Europe,
or contributed to its cultivation.</p>

<p>All that can be said in favour of the Crusades, therefore, is confined to
a few occasions, on which they co-operated with causes already existing, and
involuntarily promoted them.</p>

<p>(1) As multitudes of wealthy vassals and knights repaired to the Holy
Land in the first campaigns, and many of them never returned, their estates
were of course sold or swallowed up by others. By this they profited who
could, the liege lord, the church, the cities already established, each after his
own manner: this promoted and accelerated the course of things, tending to
confirm the regal power by the erection of a middle class, but was by no means
its commencement.</p>

<p>(2) Men became acquainted with countries, people, religions, and constitutions
of which they were before ignorant; their narrow sphere of vision was
enlarged; they acquired new ideas, new impulses. Attention was drawn to
things which would otherwise have been neglected; what had long existed
in Europe was employed to better purpose; and as the world was found to
be wider than had been supposed, curiosity was excited after a knowledge
of its remotest parts. The mighty conquests made by Jenghiz Khan in the
north and east of Asia attracted men’s eyes chiefly towards Tatary; whither
Marco Polo the Venetian, Rubruquis (Guillaume de Rubrouck), the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
Frenchman, and John de Plano Carpino (Giovanni Piano Carpini), an
Italian, travelled with very different views: the first, for the purpose of
trade; the second, to satisfy royal curiosity; the third, sent by the pope,
to make converts of the people. These travels, of course, have no connection
with the Crusades, before and after which they were undertaken.
The Levant itself is less known to us from these expeditions, than might
have been expected: the accounts the Orientals give of it, even in the period
when Syria swarmed with Christians, are still indispensable to us.</p>

<p>(3) Finally, in this holy theatre Europeans became better acquainted
with one another, though not in a manner much to be prized. With this more
intimate acquaintance kings and princes for the most part brought home an
implacable enmity: in particular the wars between England and France
derived from them fresh fuel. The unfortunate experiment, that a Christian
republic could and might contend in unison against infidels, formed a precedent
for similar wars in Europe, which have since extended to other quarters
of the globe. At the same time it cannot be denied that, while the neighbouring
powers of Europe obtained a closer inspection of their mutual weaknesses
and strength, some obscure hints were given for a more comprehensive
policy, and a new system of relationship in peace and war. Everyone was
desirous of wealth, trade, conveniences, and luxuries; as an uncultivated
mind is prone to admire these in strangers, and envy them in the hands of
another. Few, who returned from the East, could be satisfied with European
manners; even their heroism left much behind, awkwardly imitated Asia in
the West, or longed for fresh travels and adventures. For the actual and
permanent good produced by any event is always proportionate to its
consonancy with reason.</p>

<p>Unfortunate would it have been for Europe if, at the time its military
swarms were contending for the Holy Sepulchre in a corner of Syria, the
arms of Jenghiz Khan had been sooner and more powerfully turned toward
the West. Then probably our quarter of the globe would have been the
prey of the Mongols, like Poland and Russia; and its nations might have
dislodged, with the pilgrim’s staff in their hands, to tell their beads round
the object of their contention.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_7b"><a href="#crusades_endnote_7b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>GIBBON ON THE RESULTS OF THE CRUSADES</h5>

<p>As soon as the arms of the Franks were withdrawn, the impression, though
not the memory, was erased in the Mohammedan realms of Egypt and Syria.
The faithful disciples of the prophet were never tempted by a profane desire
to study the laws or language of the idolaters; nor did the simplicity of
their primitive manners receive the slightest alteration from their intercourse
in peace and war with the unknown strangers of the West. The Greeks,
who thought themselves proud, but who were only vain, showed a disposition
somewhat less inflexible. In the efforts for the recovery of their empire,
they emulated the valour, discipline, and tactics of their antagonists. The
modern literature of the West they might justly despise; but its free spirit
would instruct them in the rights of man; and some institutions of public and
private life were adopted from the French. The correspondence of Constantinople
and Italy diffused the knowledge of the Latin tongue; and several of
the fathers and classics were at length honoured with a Greek version. But
the national and religious prejudices of the Orientals were inflamed by persecution;
and the reign of the Latins confirmed the separation of the two churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span></p>

<p>If we compare, at the era of the Crusades, the Latins of Europe with the
Greeks and Arabians, their respective degrees of knowledge, industry, and
art, our rude ancestors must be content with the third rank in the scale of
nations. Their successive improvement and present superiority may be
ascribed to a peculiar energy of character, to an active and imitative spirit,
unknown to their more polished rivals, who at that time were in a stationary
or retrograde state. With such a disposition, the Latins should have derived
the most early and essential benefits from a series of events which opened to
their eyes the prospect of the world, and introduced them to a long and frequent
intercourse with the more cultivated regions of the East. Yet in a
reign of sixty years the Latins of Constantinople disdained the speech and
learning of their subjects; and the manuscripts were the only treasures which
the natives might enjoy without rapine or envy. Aristotle was indeed the
oracle of the Western universities, but it was a barbarous Aristotle; and, instead
of ascending to the fountain head, his Latin votaries humbly accepted
a corrupt and remote version from the Jews and Moors of Andalusia.</p>

<p>The principle of the Crusades was a savage fanaticism; and the most
important effects were analogous to the cause. Each pilgrim was ambitious
to return with his sacred spoils, the relics of Greece and Palestine; and each
relic was preceded and followed by a train of miracles and visions. The
belief of the Catholics was corrupted by new legends, their practice by new
superstitions; and the establishment of the Inquisition, the mendicant orders
of monks and friars, the last abuse of indulgences, and the final progress of
idolatry flowed from the baleful fountain of the holy war. The active
spirit of the Latins preyed on the vitals of their reason and religion; and if
the ninth and tenth centuries were the times of darkness, the thirteenth and
fourteenth were the age of absurdity and fable.</p>

<p>The lives and labours of millions, which were buried in the East, would
have been more profitably employed in the improvement of their native country;
the accumulated stock of industry and wealth would have overflowed
in navigation and trade; and the Latins would have been enriched and
enlightened by a pure and friendly correspondence with the climates of the
East.</p>

<p>In one respect we can indeed perceive the accidental operation of the
Crusades, not so much in producing a benefit as in removing an evil. The
larger portion of the inhabitants of Europe was chained to the soil, without
freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the two orders of ecclesiastics and
nobles, whose numbers were comparatively small, alone deserved the name of
citizens and men. Among the cause that undermined that Gothic edifice,
a conspicuous place must be allowed to the Crusades. The estates of the
barons were dissipated, and their race was often extinguished, in these costly
and perilous expeditions. Their poverty extorted from their pride those
charters of freedom which unlocked the fetters of the slave, secured the farm
of the peasant and the shop of the artificer, and gradually restored a substance
and a soul to the most numerous and useful part of the community. The
conflagration, which destroyed the tall and barren trees of the forest, gave air
and scope to the vegetation of the smaller and nutritive plants of the soil.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_7d"><a href="#crusades_endnote_7d">d</a></span></p>

<h4 id="CRUSADES_APPENDIX">APPENDIX. FEUDALISM</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[800-1450 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>To the average mind the term Middle Ages is a synonym for chaos.
And, compared with the periods before and after, it is indeed chaos. But,
in a sense, all human history is “without form,” even if not “void,” and the
comparative simplicity which we see in certain periods is arrived at chiefly
by a process of the cancellation of numberless confusing details and the concentration
of the attention on certain large and picturesque personages or
movements which were actually far from holding such stark and eminent
importance in the eyes of contemporaries.</p>

<p>Thus in the case of Alexander’s conquest of that little segment of space
which he called “the world,” to the contemporary Athenian, Alexander was
almost a myth lost in the wilderness of the East as in a fog. The Athenian
found his immediate troubles and triumphs in his own family, in his shop,
in his deme. To myriads of other peoples, however, Alexander’s very existence
was unknown; and splendid intrigues, superb politics, lofty feats of
statecraft and of warfare were taking place far from the orbit of Alexander.
These deeds were never chronicled, or the chronicles are lost, or perhaps
only waiting discovery. Consequently we are ignorant of these confusing
histories, and sum up in the exclusive phrase “Alexandrian epoch” a vast
web of what were chaos, did we but know more of it.</p>

<p>But still, taking history as we have it, the Middle Ages torment and
bewilder us with the variety and seeming unimportance of their events.
They are called the Dark Ages, though, upon a closer look, they deserve the
name no more than the Night herself with all her revelation of the stars
which the Day absorbs in the one central splendour of the sun.</p>

<p>Let the name of Dark Ages stand, however, though it must not be forgotten
that human history at least dreamed and walked in this apparent
sleep. There is no lack of chronicle and no lack of action. Nor, in spite of
the common idea, was there lack of progress. The barbarians had come
down in avalanches of stolid clay upon the gardens of civilisation. During<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
the seeming idleness the seeds were at work and ideals were busily thrusting
upward till of a sudden they burst forth in that springtime known as the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>The history of each major country is given, in this work, its own
chronicle, but for the better comprehension of the forces that were making
possible the Renaissance and driving mankind to cry aloud for a betterment
of conditions, it will be useful to set apart for brief consideration certain
special phases and forces of Middle Age life. It will make it the easier to
comprehend that life was by no means without the ferment of progress
during that period which we so arbitrarily cleave out of history and put
aside as the Middle Age.</p>

<p>Throughout the various histories of modern nations will be found a
discussion of the multiform phases of feudalism. It is desirable, however,
to give it some isolated discussion, though necessarily brief. A guide might
be found in the words of Bryce, whose definition of feudalism also makes a
good beginning; and in the words of the philosopher Hegel:<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>BRYCE AND HEGEL ON FEUDALISM</h5>

<p>“This is not the place for tracing the origin of feudality on Roman soil,
nor for showing how, by a sort of contagion, it spread into Germany, how it
struck firm root in the period of comparative quiet under Pepin and Charles,
how from the hands of the latter it took the impress which determined its
ultimate form, how the weakness of his successors allowed it to triumph
everywhere. Still less would it be possible here to examine its social and
moral influence. Politically it might be defined as the system which made
the owner of a piece of land, whether large or small, the sovereign of those
who dwelt thereon; an annexation of personal to territorial authority more
familiar to eastern despotism than to the free races of primitive Europe. On
this principle were founded, and by it are explained, feudal law and justice,
feudal finance, feudal legislation, each tenant holding towards his lord the
position which his own tenants held towards himself. And it is just because
the relation was so uniform, the principle so comprehensive, the ruling class
so firmly bound to its support, that feudalism has been able to lay upon
society that grasp which the struggles of more than twenty generations
have scarcely shaken off.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8b1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8b">b</a></span></p>

<p>The three steps by which feudalism was reached are thus broadly summed
up by Hegel:</p>

<p>“While the first period of the German world ends brilliantly with a
mighty empire, the second is commenced by the reaction resulting from the
antithesis occasioned by that infinite falsehood which rules the destinies of
the Middle Ages and constitutes their life and spirit. This reaction is, first,
that of the particular nationalities against the universal sovereignty of the
Frankish Empire, manifesting itself in the splitting up of that great empire.
The second reaction is that of individuals against legal authority and the
executive power&mdash;against subordination, and the military and judicial
arrangements of the constitution. This produced the isolation and therefore
defencelessness of individuals. The universality of the power of the state
disappeared through this reaction; individuals sought protection with the
powerful, and the latter became oppressors. Thus was gradually introduced
a condition of universal independence, and this protecting relation was then
systematised into the feudal system.”<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8c1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8c">c</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span></p>

<h5>COMMENCEMENT OF THE FEUDAL RÉGIME</h5>

<p>The true heirs of Charlemagne were not the kings of France, nor those
of Germany and Italy, at first, but rather the feudal lords. Not only had
the empire been dismembered after the deposition of Charles the Fat, but its
composing kingdoms and even its great fiefs as well. Dukes and counts
had been quite as powerless as kings against the Northmen, Saxons, and
Hungarians, and quite as unable to maintain the vast domains under their
control. Populations whose leaders did not know how to bring them
together for concerted action had acquired, little by little, the habit of
depending upon themselves alone.</p>

<p>After having fled for a long time at the approach of the heathen to the
woods among the wild beasts, some stout-hearted people had turned their
heads and refused to abandon all their possessions without an attempt at
defence. Here and there in mountain gorges, at river fords, on the hill
overlooking the plain, entrenchments and walls were raised where the brave
and the strong held out. An edict of 853 directed the counts and vassals of
the king to repair their old castles and to build new ones. The country was
soon covered with fortresses against which invaders flung themselves in vain.
A few reverses quickly taught these bold adventurers prudence. They no
longer dared to venture so far, to where these strongholds had sprung up
from the ground on all sides, and the new invasion meeting with fresh
obstacles and difficulties came to an end in the following century. It was
not until afterwards that the masters of these castles became the terror of
the countryside they had once helped to save.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p483.jpg" width="500" height="175" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Feudal Castle</span></p>
</div>

<p>Feudalism, so oppressive in its age of decline, had therefore its time of
lawful and just existence. All power is raised up by its virtues and falls by
its abuse.</p>

<p>But what was the new régime? We have seen the matter of acquiring
and holding property become more uniform among barbarian nations, by the
settlement of heredity upon lands ceded by the king, and the law’s sanction
given to another kind of usurpation&mdash;the heredity of the royal offices.
It was generally the owners of freehold property or of royal lands who
became the holders of these offices, which brought about the union of
sovereignty and proprietorship in the same hands. This is essentially what
constitutes feudalism.</p>

<p>In the absolute monarchy of the Roman Empire public offices in all
degrees of the hierarchy were bestowed directly by the ruler, and their
disposition remained always in his power, so that he could take them back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
when and under what condition he pleased. Furthermore the public official
held neither the land of the province he governed nor the control of any
particular piece of property that he might happen to own as a private citizen.
He was bound therefore, as landlord, by the civil law applicable to the whole
empire, and as governor, to the voluntary will of his sovereign. In the
feudal régime it was exactly the opposite. The lord who <i>enfeoffed</i>, that is,
conceded by title of sub-fief some portion of his own fief, gave up entirely
to the grantee or <i>vassal</i> the property and its control, and it could not be
taken back unless the vassal failed to perform some part of the agreement
made at the time of receiving the investiture.</p>

<p>One lord might obtain land from another and thus become his vassal.
The former had to go to the latter, and between the two there took place
the ceremony known as homage. Kneeling before his future lord, with
their hands together, the future vassal proclaimed loudly that he would be
the other’s <i>homme</i>, or man, that is to say, that he would be attached and
devoted to him, defend him with his own life, somewhat as the ancient
<i>leudes</i> of Germany did towards their warrior chiefs. After this profession,
which is homage in the original sense of the word, he took an oath of fidelity
or faith to the lord, promising to fulfil the new duties required of him under
the new title of <i>homme</i> of the lord. When he had contracted this double
tie, the lord no longer feared to confide his land to a man so strongly bound
to him, and gave it to him by investiture or seizin, accompanied with
symbolic emblems&mdash;a sod of grass, a stone, or some other object according
to the custom of the fief. “It is the custom,” says Otto von Freising,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8e"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8e">e</a></span> “to
deliver up kingdoms by the sword, and provinces by the standard.” This
three-part ceremony of homage once completed, the reciprocal obligations
began.</p>

<h5>RECIPROCAL OBLIGATIONS OF VASSAL AND LORD</h5>

<p>There were in the first place the moral obligations of the vassal towards
his lord, such as keeping his secrets, revealing the machinations of his enemies,
to give one’s horse to him in battle if he be unseated, to take his
place in captivity, to respect and to cause his honour to be respected, to assist
him with good counsel, etc. The material obligations, the services due from
the vassal, were of several kinds.</p>

<p>(1) Military service. This was the very basis of the feudal relation and
the principle of that state of society which does not contain permanent
and organised armies. The vassal on the requisition of his lord was bound
to follow him, either alone, or to bring such and such a number of men
according to the importance of his fief. The duration of this service also was
dependent on the same thing&mdash;it might be sixty, forty, or only twenty
days&mdash;a system which did not permit of distant expeditions and could be
employed only in neighbourhood or private wars. There were some fiefs
where military service held only within the feudal domain, or could be called
on only for purposes of defence.</p>

<p>(2) The “fiance,” or obligation to serve the lord in his court of justice.
As under the feudal régime the lord replaced the states general, and was
invested with the functions of public power, it was necessary in order to
exercise these to hold at his command the forces disseminated through the
hands of his vassals. War was one of these functions; justice was another.</p>

<p>The lord summonsed his men to court, and they had to attend, either to
serve him with their advice or to take part in the judging of disputes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
brought before him, and they thus bound themselves to assistance in carrying
out the judgments their own mouths had proclaimed.</p>

<p>(3) The “aids,” some legal and compulsory, others courteous and voluntary.
Legal aids were usually demanded under three conditions&mdash;when
the lord was a prisoner and required to pay a ransom, when he knighted
his eldest son, and when he gave his eldest daughter in marriage. This aid
took the place of the public imposts of ancient and modern legislatures, but
as may be seen was of a totally different character. It was not, in fact,
periodic or exacted in a regular manner for public needs; it had the appearance
of a voluntary gift under certain peculiar circumstances. An annual
tax would have seemed an affront to the vassals.</p>

<p>To these services must be added certain feudal rights by which the lord,
in virtue of his sovereignty, intervened in any important change the ceded
fief might undergo. Some of these were for him a new source of revenue.
These rights were the relief, a sum of money due from every major individual
who entered into possession of a fief by right of succession, and more
particularly if that succession did not take place in line of direct descent;
the right to the alienation tax, which he who sold or alienated his fief in any
fashion must pay; the right of disinheritance and confiscation by which
the fief reverted to the lord when the vassal died without heirs or when he
had forfeited his fief or deserved for any reason to be deprived of it; the
right of guardianship, by virtue of which the lord, during the minority of
his vassal, undertook his tutelage and the administration of his fief, and
enjoyed its revenue; the marriage right, that is to say, the right of the overlord
to provide a husband for the heiress of a fief, and oblige her to choose
from the suitors he presents.</p>

<p>The vassal who fulfilled his obligations fully and conscientiously was as
nearly as possible master of his own fief. He could in turn enfeoff the whole
or part of his domain, and become in turn the sovereign lord of vassals of a
lower rank, or <i>vavasseurs</i>, holding towards him the same obligations as he to
his own lord. Such was the fabric of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>If the vassal had his obligations, the lord also had his. He could not take
back a fief arbitrarily or without a legitimate reason from his vassal. He
must protect him if he were attacked, see that he received justice, etc.</p>

<p>Let us note that the feudal system in developing itself made a fief of
everything. Every concession&mdash;for hunting in the forests, for ferrying
across rivers, for acting as guides on the roads, for escorting merchants, for
running communal ovens in the towns&mdash;every useful employment, in fact,
conceded in return for fidelity and homage, became a fief.</p>

<p>Lords multiplied concessions of this kind in order to multiply the number
of men owing them military service. But the fief itself, to which the
rights of justice were attached, remained in general undivided and was
handed down according to the laws of primogeniture.</p>

<h5>FEUDAL JUSTICE</h5>

<p>The obligation of the vassals to attend the courts of their lord has made
it clear that the principle of feudal justice was trial by one’s peers, a principle
which was entirely in the customs and even the institutions of the Germanic
peoples, where freedmen were tried by an assembly of freedmen.</p>

<p>They called peers (<i>pares</i>, equals), vassals of the same lord settled around
him on his domain, and holding fiefs of the same rank. The king himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span>
had his peers who were those holding their estates directly from him, not
only as feudal lord but as king. Each had the right to be judged by his
peers before his lord. If the peers refused him justice or the vassal believed
that it had been unfairly rendered, he made a complaint “in default of
right,” and brought the matter to the attention of his lord’s suzerain. It
was to this higher tribunal that it was necessary always to bring disputes
which arose between a lord and his vassal.</p>

<p>But this right of appeal did not entirely satisfy the spirit of independence
which animated this warlike society. The lords preserved with jealous
care another right of appeal&mdash;that which is addressed to the power of
arms; they preferred to obtain justice for themselves rather than receive it
from the hands of others. So thoroughly was the custom enrooted in their
manners that the king regulated the formalities which preceded this species
of warfare and had for their object the warning of the party to be attacked
and the giving of an opportunity to place himself in a state of defence.
After all, our international wars proceed from the same principle and are no
better. The lords waged their wars with their little armies as we with our
greater ones. Only hostilities had a more individual character since the
states were much smaller.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8i1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8i">i</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the <i>Fehde</i> or right of private warfare&mdash;an old Germanic custom&mdash;there
was the “trial by combat,” which must not be confused with
it. The true “judicial combat,” in which champions fight for a cause, or
for the settlement of a quarrel, is a product of the Middle Ages, when
faith in God was as strong as faith in the strength of the human arm. This
custom became so universal a method of settlement of difficult questions
that it was even used by Alfonso, the great Spanish lawgiver, to decide upon
the introduction of new laws concerning inheritance. This much at least
may be said in favour of it, that it was less of an evil than the torture which
tended to supplant it in judicial proceedings in the later Middle Ages.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<p>Justice was not the prerogative of all the lords to the same extent. It
was distinguished in France by three degrees, high, low, and middle justice.
The first alone gave the right of life and death. In general it may be said
it was the largest and most important fiefs that had powers of justice to the
greatest extent. Still it was possible for a simple <i>vavasseur</i> to possess the
functions of “high justice,” and in some places the lord who could dispense
but “low justice” could punish with death the robber caught at his crime.
Within these variable limits the lord alone dispensed justice on his fief, and
when, later on, royalty usurped the right, there was a revolution.</p>

<p>To complete the enumeration of rights inherent in the sovereignty of the
lords it is necessary to mention two: first, that of recognising throughout the
whole extent of the fief no higher legislative power. We find in the last collection
of laws made in the ninth century by Charles the Simple the final manifestation
of law-bearing public power. After that, there were no laws, civil
or political, to be applied generally, but only local customs, isolated, independent,
and differing one from the other, in fact possessing a territorial character
in distinction from those of the barbaric nations, which were entirely personal.</p>

<p>Second, the right to coin money, which was always a sign of lordship.
Before Charlemagne it seems that some private individuals, who doubtless
possessed the privilege, coined money. After him this was one of the prerogatives
of the lords, and at the advent of Hugh Capet there were no less
than 150 who exercised this right.</p>

<p>Every political régime may be characterised by the place where the exercise
of power is bestowed. Ancient republics had their agora and fora.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
The great monarchy of Louis XIV had its palace of Versailles. The feudal
lords had their castles. They were, as a usual thing, enormous edifices,
situated on high places, massive, round, or square, without architecture or
ornamentation, the walls pierced by a few loopholes for the discharge of
arrows. There was a single entrance giving on a great moat which could
only be passed by a drawbridge. The castle was crowned with parapets
and battlements, from which rocks, molten pitch, and lead could be thrown
down on the heads of too venturesome assailants at the foot of the walls.
To-day the gaping gray masses are but nests for crows, crumbled and eaten
away by time. Seen from afar they quite eclipse the small and light habitation
of modern days&mdash;these monuments at once of legitimate defence and
oppression. But they could have been nothing less than they were to provide
shelter from the northern incursions and the feudal wars. Everyone sought
refuge in them. Those who had not the right to live within the castle, who
were neither lords nor warriors, settled around its great walls, under their
powerful protection. This was the nucleus of many towns.</p>

<h5>ECCLESIASTICAL FEUDALISM</h5>

<p>Even the clergy had their place in this system. The bishop, formerly
“defender of the city,” had often become its count, by traditional usurpation
or by express royal concession when the king had united the county
and the bishopric, the temporal and the spiritual authority. This made
the bishop sovereign of all the lords of his diocese.</p>

<p>Besides her tithes the church possessed, through the donation of the
faithful, immense wealth, and in order to protect this from the brigandage
of the times she had recourse to secular arms. She chose laymen, men of
courage and wisdom, to whom she confided her property that they might
defend it, if necessary at the point of the sword. But these attorneys of the
monasteries and churches did as the counts of the king&mdash;made their functions
hereditary, and took for themselves the wealth entrusted to their care.
They condescended, however, to regard themselves as the vassals of those
whom they had despoiled, and to swear faith and homage under ordinary
conditions of natural right and personal service.</p>

<p>Abbés and bishops in consequence became suzerains, temporal lords
having numerous vassals ready to take up arms for their cause, courts of
justice&mdash;in fact all the prerogatives exercised by the great landlords.
There were bishops, dukes, and bishop-counts, vassals themselves of greater
lords and especially of the king, from whom they received the investiture
of the property attached to their churches, or, as it was called, their temporal
domain.</p>

<p>This ecclesiastical feudalism was so extensive, so powerful, that in France
and England it possessed during the Middle Ages more than a fifth of all the
land; in Germany nearly a third. For there was this difference between
the church and king, that the latter, a conquest once made, received nothing
more, but on the contrary constantly gave away until it came to pass that he
possessed nothing but the town of Laon; while the church, if she did lose
some of her land (a difficult thing since she had excommunication to defend
it with), was acquiring more every day, since few of the faithful died without
leaving her something. And so it was that she constantly got more and
never or very rarely gave anything up, and then only when it was wrested
from her by force.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8i2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8i">i</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span></p>

<p>The manner in which the church often lost her property in feudal times
is described by Carl Spannagel:</p>

<h5>THE CHURCH AND THE FEUDAL ARMY</h5>

<p>The bishops and abbots as land proprietors went into the battle-field at
the head of their contingents. They often wore armour under their priestly
garments, and they did not shrink from actual fighting in action. The care
for souls (if such an expression can be used with regard to a priestly dignitary
of the Middle Ages) which even in peace made but a slight demand
upon them, must have nearly vanished under such circumstances in the
field. The account of Bishop Daniel of Prague attending to the wounded
and administering them spiritual comfort has a modern foreign tone about
it. Only special royal permission could exempt the bishops and their
respective abbots from appearing at the head of their men.</p>

<p>But the king did not make such frequent demands upon the participation
of the spiritual dignitaries in campaigns as we are inclined to think. This
idea arose from the command of Otto II in 981, which demanded the personal
command of their contingents of seven bishops and the seven abbots, whilst
twelve bishops and three abbots are told only to send their <i>loricati</i> to the
emperor. Substitutes for the bishops and abbots in this case would be
priests or vassals of rank of their diocese, or abbotship.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the immunity, the purport of which had so increased
in extent since the Carlovingian time, exercised no influence on the
military obligations of the churches to which it was addressed. In most of the
immunity documents military duty is not touched upon, so it was considered
something quite independent. In some it is expressly mentioned that no
<i>index publicus</i> should exercise the arrière-ban over the particular cloister, but
this made no change in the obligation of the abbots themselves. On the
contrary, in a privilege of Otto I for the bishopric of Worms, the sentence
from a document of Louis the Pious is retained which commands that the
military followers of the men of the church are only to be called upon in the
interest of the kingdom. The transfer of their service to the princes was of
greater import to the military obligations of the church than the immunity.</p>

<p>Such transfers, however, only refer to monasteries and not also to bishoprics.
There were two different kinds of exemption&mdash;either the king gives
the cloister in question to a lord of his kingdom as a favour or as his property,
so that (forever or for a time) it ceases to be a royal cloister, or he
takes away a part of its landed property and makes it over to lay princes
who thenceforward undertake the military duties hitherto pertaining to the
cloister. By this means the cloister remains royal, only it is exempt from
military obligations. A third possibility was added to these two. Very
often the great lords did not wait for the king’s initiative to enrich themselves
with church property, but they seized it on their own account and
obtained possession of the longed-for cloister by any means.</p>

<p>With such measures by force there was certainly no legal adoption of the
obligation which the cloister owed the kingdom. But there is no doubt that
the property thus gained was taken into account in the valuation of the service
due to the kingdom by the new owner. The documental protection
of the king generally proved most inefficient against such seizures. In more
ancient times, particularly under the later Carlovingians, we find taxations
of abbotships. The cases became rarer later on without quite disappearing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
The kingdom evidently did not depend upon increasing the power of
the princes which was continually developing by such means, so that the
seizures of the princes increased with the feudal system.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8d"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8d">d</a></span></p>

<h5>SERFS AND VILLEINS</h5>

<p>In the eleventh century, Carlovingian Europe was divided into a multitude
of fiefs which formed each its own state, having its own life, laws, customs,
and its almost perfectly independent lay or ecclesiastical chief.</p>

<p>We have described the community of the lords, but they were not the
only feudal community. That was the fighting and war-making community,
the community that ruled, judged, punished, and oppressed. Below this
was the community that worked, by which the other lived, got its clothes,
its arms, its castles, and its bread&mdash;the community of serfs, or rather craftsmen
(<i>gens potestatis</i>). We must not now look for free men, for they have
disappeared. Some have raised themselves and become the fortunate lords;
others have been pushed back into the lower regions of society and have
become serfs and villeins. That class of simple freemen which had been
nearly swept away in the invasion of the Roman Empire had been engulfed
a second time. There were no longer any freehold owners, or so few that
their mention is not worth while.</p>

<p>But the villeins were a numerous lot. The chief, the noble, had not only
vassals but subjects residing on that portion of his estate that he never
enfeoffed. And these were the serfs, properly called, men of the soil who were
entirely at their lord’s disposal. “The lord,” says Beaumanoir,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8f1"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8f">f</a></span> “can take
from them all that they have, put them in prison, rightly or wrongly, and as
often as he pleases, and has no account to give of them except to God.”</p>

<p>In spite of this the condition of the serf was better than that of the slave
of ancient times. The progress which slavery had made at the fall of the
Roman Empire was not entirely lost in the wreckage of invasion, but appeared
again in feudal society. The freeman of antiquity had been harder towards
his slave than was the barbarian in whom the leaven of Christianity had produced
some effect. The serf was recognised as a man having a family, sharing
the common ancestry of his lord, and made in the image of God. Serfs
finally entered the church, and sometimes mounted higher than the most
powerful lords.</p>

<p>Above the serfs were the inalienables (<i>mainmortables</i>), “more kindly
treated,” continues the old jurist of Beauvais,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8f2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8f">f</a></span> “since the lord, if they did
no wrong, could ask nothing of them except their dues and rents and the
debts which they were accustomed to pay for their servitude.” But the inalienable
could not marry without the consent of his lord, and if he took a
free wife, or one outside the seigneury, there was a fine at the pleasure of the
lord. This was the right of “formarriage” (a tax for marriage out of rank
or condition), and the issue of such a marriage was divided between the
lords of the husband and of the wife. If there was but one child, it went
to the lord of the mother. At an inalienable’s death all his property went to
his lord. For these people there was no way of escape from the hand that
bent them to the furrow. Wherever they went the right of succession was
attached to their persons and their purse. The lord inherited on every hand
from his serfs.</p>

<p>In a higher degree still were to be found the free tenants known as villeins,
peasants, or commoners. Their condition was less precarious. They had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
preserved the freedom the serf did not possess, and had hung on to it at the
sacrifice of an annual tax, a statute duty, and the rent of the land which
the landlord had ceded them and which they could transmit with all their
other property to their children. But while the beneficiary holdings or fiefs
were under the protection of a public and well-defined law, the land of the
villeins was under the absolute jurisdiction of the landlord and protected
only by private agreements. This is why the villeins, and especially those
in the country, where it was not necessary to oversee them as strictly as
those in the large towns, were often under the heel of absolute dominion.</p>

<p>One reads in ancient documents about the lords: “They are masters of
heaven and earth; they have jurisdiction above and beneath the ground,
over necks and heads, over the water, winds, and fields.” The villeins could
not escape their jurisdiction, for the feudal law said, “Between thee, lord,
and thee, villein, there is no judge but God.” “We recognise from our
gracious lords,” runs another formula, “both ban and convocation; the high
forest, the bird in the air, the fish in the stream, the beast in the bush, as far
as our sovereign lord, or the servants of his grace, can hold his own. For
this our gracious lord will take under his shelter and protection the widow
and orphan as well as the peasant.” Thus were all rights given over to the
lord, but in exchange he protected the weak. Such is the principle of feudal
society towards its subjects. Royalty no longer filled the office for which it
was instituted; bishops, counts, barons, and other powers were called upon
for the protection which could no longer be expected from the nominal head
of the state.</p>

<p>Everything belonged to the lord; but since there was no industry or
commerce, no luxury by which one alone could consume in a few moments
the fruit of the labour of many, the exactions of this lord were not at first
oppressive, and for the villeins these exactions were as systematically determined
as are to-day the rights of the landlord over his farmer-tenants. Only
in the Middle Ages was there always the element of arbitrariness and violence
which modern law does not allow. The villeins’ tax was paid either
in natural produce, as provisions, corn, cattle, and fowl, products of the soil
and the farm; or in work, or manual labour, as statute labour in the fields and
vineyards of the lord, in the building of his castle, or digging ditches, in
the repair of roads; or the making of furniture, utensils, horseshoes, ploughshares,
carts, etc. In towns and wherever money was scarce, the lord did
not make the mistake, it must be understood, of demanding his dues in coin,
or of imposing arbitrary taxes. But let us go back to the times themselves
and listen to the words of a scribe: “The lord who demands unjust rights
of his villein, does so at the peril of his soul.” If the fear of heaven did not
suffice, here were the commoners coming to the rescue, and the king’s officials
were not far behind.</p>

<p>There were some strange compensations to enliven the sad life of the
feudal lord, shut up the whole year within the sombre walls of his castle.
At Bologna, in Italy, the tenantry of the Benedictines of St. Procule paid
as a tax the steam from a boiled capon. Every year each man brought his
capon between two plates to the abbot, uncovered it, and, the steam having
all been given off, was quits, and took his capon back with him. Elsewhere
the peasants brought solemnly before their lord, in a carriage drawn
by four horses, a little bird, or perhaps a may-bush decorated with ribbons.
The man who owned a monkey was quits, according to an ordinance of St. Louis,
when he had caused the monkey to perform before the lord’s tax-gatherer;
the jongleur had to pay with one song. The lords themselves did not refuse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
sometimes, to play a rôle in these folk comedies. The markgraf of Jülich,
whenever he made a solemn entry, was mounted on a one-eyed horse, with
wooden saddle, and bridle of bark from the linden, and wearing two spires
of hawthorn, and carrying a white stick. When the abbé of Figeac came
into town the lord of Monbrun received him in a most grotesque costume
with one leg bare.</p>

<p>Feudalism, bored with itself, laughed sometimes with the poor people, as
did also the church when she authorised the celebration in the basilicas of the
feast of the Asses. The powerful and the fortunate, in this age so sad and
so stern, where misery was everywhere and security nowhere, owed much to
their villeins and peasants for giving them some moments of forgetfulness
and pleasure.</p>

<h5>ANARCHY AND VIOLENCE; FRIGHTFUL CONDITION OF THE PEASANTS
AND SOME HAPPY RESULTS THEREFROM</h5>

<p>They were in truth hard times for the poor people, these Middle Ages,
when in spite of all the formulæ and other conventions, the noble did not
believe in anything but the right of the sword. In theory the principles of
the feudal relation were very beautiful; in practise they nearly brought
matters to a state of anarchy, for its judicial institutions were too defective
to prevent the tie of vassalage from being constantly broken. Here lay the
cause of the interminable wars which broke out in all parts of feudal Europe,
and which were the great affliction of that epoch. Everyone could have
recourse to his sword in a proven wrong or a sentence he deemed unjust, and
a state of war was chronic in that society. Every hill became a fortress;
every plain a field of battle.</p>

<p>Shut up in strong castles, covered with mail, and surrounded by armed
men, the feudal lords, “the tyrants,” as a monk of the eleventh century calls
them, lived but to fight, and knew no other mode of enrichment than pillage.
There was no more commerce&mdash;the roads were no longer safe; no more industry,
for the lords, masters of the towns, levied upon the burghers as soon
as some little sign of wealth would appear. The most different customs were
established everywhere, since there was no longer any general legislation,
each noble having sole law-making power on his own fief.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Everywhere,
likewise, there was the deepest ignorance except perhaps in the heart of some
of the monasteries; and the clergy, guardians of moral law, were compelled
not to forbid violence, but to regulate it by the “Truce of God” [<i>Treuga
Dei</i>], which forbade killing and robbing from Wednesday evening to Monday
morning.</p>

<p>On whom fell all the burden of these feudal wars? They were not very
murderous for the nobles wrapped in steel, but they were so for the peasant
with scarcely any defensive armour. At Brenneville, where the kings of
France and England fought, nine hundred knights took part, and only three
were left on the battle-field. At Bouvines, Philip Augustus was thrown from
his horse and remained some time helpless amidst the foot-soldiers of the
enemy. They vainly sought some opening in his armour through which to
pass a dagger blade, and they dealt heavy blows which could not break his
cuirass. His knights took their time about rescuing and replacing him
in the saddle. After which he threw himself with them into the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
that rabble where their long lances and heavy axes did not deliver a single
blow in vain. The sovereign captured, another calamity; his ransom must
be paid. But who paid for the cottage and the burned fields of the poor
peasant&mdash;who stanched his wounds, who provided for his widow and
orphans?</p>

<p>Two contemporary writers, historians of the Crusades, paint thus these
direful times: “Before the Christians left for the countries beyond the sea,”
says Guibert de Nogent, “the kingdom of France was in the throes of constant
trouble and hostilities. One heard nothing but of brigandage on the
public roads. Fires were innumerable, and war was inflicted on every hand
for no other reason than insatiable cupidity. In short, grasping men respected
no right of property and gave themselves up to pillage with unrestrained
boldness.”</p>

<p>And William, archbishop of Tyre,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8h"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8h">h</a></span> says: “There was no security for
property. Were a man regarded as rich, this was sufficient excuse for
throwing him into prison, keeping him in irons, and putting him to cruel
torture. Sword-girded brigands infested the roads, lay in ambush, and
spared neither strangers nor men devoted to the service of God. Cities and
fortified towns were not safe from such crimes. Cut-throats made the
streets and squares dangerous for the wealthy man.” In the seventy years
between 970 and 1040 there were forty of famine and pestilence.</p>

<p>However, the onward march of civilisation can never be so completely
suspended that these centuries were absolutely sterile for the progress of
humanity. In the church thought awakened, and in lay society poetry
made its appearance. There was even some progress in morals, at least
among the ruling classes. In the isolation in which each one lived, exposed to
all sorts of perils, the soul fortified itself to meet them. The feeling of the
dignity of man, which despotism managed to smother, was revived; and
the society which spilled blood with such deplorable facility showed often a
moral elevation which is to be found only in this age. The low vices and
cowardice of the decadent Romans or enslaved peoples were unknown to
them, and the Middle Ages have bequeathed to modern times the sentiment
of honour. The feudal nobility knew how to die, which is the first condition of
knowing how to get the most out of life.</p>

<p>Another beneficial consequence was the reorganisation of the family. In
ancient cities the head of the family lived outside his house, in the fields or
in the forum. He scarcely knew his wife and children, yet had over them
the right of life and death. In primitive times the custom of polygamy and
the facility for divorce prevented the family from establishing itself on any
better basis. In feudal society men lived in isolation, and the head of the
family was brought into close touch with it. When wars gave him leisure
in his castle, perched like an eagle’s nest on the mountain top, he had
nothing to occupy his life and his heart but his wife and children. The
church, which brought rough soldiers to the feet of a virgin and made them
for the sake of the mother of Christ respect female virtue, softened the temper
of the warrior and prepared him to come under the spell of the finer feelings
and more delicate sentiments with which nature had endowed the other sex.</p>

<p>Woman assumed, then, her place in the family and in society which the
Mosaic law had once given her. Things went even further&mdash;she became
the object of a cult which created new sentiments, which the poetry of troubadours
and minstrels seized upon and which chivalry expressed in action.
As in the beautiful legend of St. Christopher, the strong was conquered by
the weak, the giant by the little child.</p>

</div>

<p>This is seen in an institution of the times. Robert d’Arbrissel founded
near Saumur at Fontevrault, about the year 1100, an abbey which soon became
famous, and which opened its gates to recluses of both sexes. The
women were cloistered, and spent their time in prayer. The men worked in
the fields, drained the marshes,
cleared the land, and remained
the perpetual servants of the
women. The abbey was governed
by an abbess, “because,”
says the bull of confirmation,
“Jesus Christ in dying gave his
best beloved disciple to his
mother for a son.”</p>

<p>Outside the family, the state
was doubtless badly organised.
It is necessary to call attention,
in spite of all contradictory
facts, to the political theory
which this society represents.
If the serf had no rights, the
vassals had them, and well-defined
ones too. The feudal
tie was formed on conditions
well known and accepted by
him in advance; new conditions
could not be placed upon him
except by his own agreement.
From these come those grand
and strong maxims of common
law which, in spite of a thousand
violations, have come down to
us&mdash;no tax can be imposed
without the consent of the contributants;
no law is valid unless
accepted by those who must obey it;
no sentence is legal unless declared
by the peers of the accused. These
are the laws of feudalism which the states
general of 1789 buried under the débris of
absolute monarchy; and in guarantee of these rights
the vassal had the power of breaking the tie of
vassalage by giving up his fief or of responding by
war to a denial of justice from his lord. This right
of armed resistance, which St. Louis himself
recognised, led, it is true, to anarchy; it weakened
the social structure, but it strengthened the individual.
But it is with the individual that we
must commence. Before intelligently building up
the state, it is necessary to elevate the individual
and the family; this double work was the task of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The church worked with energy to establish the sanctity of marriage,
even for the serf; in preaching the equality of all men before God, which
was a threat to the great inequalities of this world; by proclaiming by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
the principle of election that she reserved for herself at the very pinnacle of
hierarchy the rights of the intellect, in contradistinction to the feudal world
which recognised but the right of blood; and in crowning with the triple
crown and seating in the chair of St. Peter, where they had one foot on the
neck of kings, a serf like Adrian II and the son of a poor carpenter, like
Gregory VII.</p>

<h5>GEOGRAPHIC OUTLINES OF THE KINGDOM OF GERMANY</h5>

<p>Such were the principles that ruled in all the countries comprised within
the limits of Charlemagne’s empire, that is to say, almost the whole of the
Germanic peoples, France, Germany, Italy, and the north of Spain. The
political geography of the countries formed itself after the fashion of its
feudal organisations. As the fundamental axiom of feudalism expressed
itself, “No territory without its lord,” there did not exist throughout the
land a domain so small that it was not incorporated in some degree in the
hierarchy. Of all these superimposed suzerainties, the royal was the only
one whose limits served to determine the extent of the realms already formed
but still very vaguely outlined.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8i3"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8i">i</a></span></p>

<p>The difference between feudalism and the politics both of antiquity and
of modern times lies, according to Paul von Roth,<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8j"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8j">j</a></span> chiefly in the absence of
a state power. There was no proper monarchy; public offices are hereditary
or belong to an estate. The impossibility of the permanence of feudalism
is shown, he says, most clearly in the feudal army by which even feudal justice
suffered. Von Roth draws a vivid comparison between France and
Germany at the end of the tenth century: France is much the more feudal
and anarchic under the powerless Hugh Capet; Germany is more centralised
under monarchic power. He compares them again three centuries later:
France is a consolidated monarchy; Germany weak with a lasting weakness.
The cause he finds above all is this&mdash;that the French kings had vigorously
and in every way worked for the uprooting of the feudal system.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#crusades_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>THE TRANSITION FROM FEUDALISM TO MONARCHY</h5>

<p>The moral phenomena above mentioned, tending in the direction of a
general principle, were partly of a subjective, partly of a speculative order.
But we must now give particular attention to the practical political movements
of the period. The advance which that period witnessed presents a
negative aspect, in so far as it involves the termination of the sway of individual
caprice and of the isolation of power. Its affirmative aspect is the
rise of a supreme authority whose dominion embraces all&mdash;a political power
properly so called, whose subjects enjoy an equality of rights, and in which
the will of the individual is subordinated to that common interest which underlies
the whole.</p>

<p>This is the advance from feudalism to monarchy. The principle of feudal
sovereignty is the outward force of individuals&mdash;princes, liege lords; it is a
force destitute of intrinsic right. The subjects of such a constitution are
vassals of a superior prince or seigneur, towards whom they have stipulated
duties to perform; but whether they perform these duties or not depends upon
the seigneur’s being able to induce them so to do, by force of character or by
grant of favours. Conversely, the recognition of those feudal claims themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
was extorted by violence in the first instance; and the fulfilment of
the corresponding duties could be secured only by the constant exercise
of the power which was the sole basis of the claims in question. The monarchical
principle also implies a supreme authority, but it is an authority over
persons possessing no independent power to support their individual caprice,
where we have no longer caprice opposed to caprice; for the supremacy implied
in monarchy is essentially a power emanating from a political body,
and is pledged to the furtherance of that equitable purpose on which the
constitution of a state is based.</p>

<p>Feudal sovereignty is a polyarchy&mdash;we see nothing but lords and serfs;
in monarchy, on the contrary, there is one lord and no serf, for servitude is
abrogated by it, and in it right and law are recognised; it is the source of
real freedom. Thus in monarchy the caprice of individuals is kept under,
and a common gubernatorial interest established. But since this monarchy
is developed from feudalism, it bears in the first instance the stamp of the
system from which it sprang. Individuals quit their isolated capacity and
become members of estates (or orders of the realm) and corporations; the
vassals are powerful only by combination as an order; in contraposition to
them the cities constitute powers in virtue of their communal existence.
Thus the authority of the sovereign ceases to be mere arbitrary sway. The
consent of the estates and corporations is essential to its maintenance; and
if the prince wishes to have it, he must will what is reasonable.</p>

<p>We now see a constitution embracing various orders, while feudal rule
knows no such orders. We observe the transition from feudalism to monarchy
taking place in three ways: (1) Sometimes the lord paramount
gains a mastery over his independent vassals, by subjugating their individual
power, thus making himself sole ruler. (2) Sometimes the princes free
themselves from the feudal relation altogether, and become the territorial
lords of certain states; or lastly (3) the lord paramount unites the particular
lordships that own him as their superior with his own particular suzerainty
in a more peaceful way, and thus becomes master of the whole.</p>

<p>These processes do not indeed present themselves in history in that pure
and abstract form in which they are exhibited here; often we find more
modes than one appearing contemporaneously, but one or the other always
predominates. The cardinal consideration is that the basis and essential
condition of such a political formation is to be looked for in the particular
nationalities in which it had its birth. Europe presents particular nations,
constituting a unity in their very nature, and having the absolute tendency
to form a state. All did not succeed in attaining this political unity; we
have now to consider them severally in relation to the change thus introduced.
First, as regards the Roman Empire, the connection between Germany
and Italy naturally results from the idea of that empire: the secular
dominion united with the spiritual was to constitute one whole; but this
state of things was rather the object of constant struggle than one actually
attained. In Germany and Italy the transition from the feudal condition to
monarchy involved the entire abrogation of the former; the vassals became
independent monarchs.</p>

<h5>PROGRESS IN GERMANY</h5>

<p>Germany had always embraced a great variety of stocks&mdash;Swabians,
Bavarians, Franks, Thuringians, Saxons, Burgundians; to these must be
added the Slavs of Bohemia, Germanised Slavs in Mecklenburg, in Brandenburg,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
and in a part of Saxony and Austria; so that no such combination as
took place in France was possible. Italy presented a similar state of things.
The Lombards had established themselves there, while the Greeks still possessed
the exarchate and lower Italy; the Normans too established a kingdom
of their own in lower Italy, and the Saracens maintained their ground
for a time in Sicily. When the rule of the house of Hohenstaufen was terminated,
barbarism got the upper hand throughout Germany; the country
being broken up into several sovereignties, in which a forceful despotism prevailed.
It was the maxim of the electoral princes to raise only weak princes
to the imperial throne; they even sold the imperial dignity to foreigners.
Thus the unity of the state was virtually annulled.</p>

<p>A number of centres of power were formed, each of which was a predatory
state; the legal constitution recognised by feudalism was dissolved, and
gave place to undisguised violence and plunder; and powerful princes made
themselves lords of the country. After the interregnum the count of Habsburg
was elected emperor, and the house of Habsburg continued to fill the
imperial throne with but little interruption. These emperors were obliged
to create a force of their own, as the princes would not grant them an adequate
power attached to the empire. But that state of absolute anarchy
was at last put an end to by associations having general aims in view. In
the cities themselves we see associations of a minor order; but now confederations
of cities were formed with a common interest in the suppression of
predatory violence. Of this kind was the Hanseatic League in the north,
the Rhenish League consisting of cities lying along the Rhine, and the
Swabian League. The aim of all these confederations was resistance to
the feudal lords; and even princes united with the cities, with a view to the
subversion of the feudal condition and the restoration of a peaceful state of
things throughout the country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p496.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Early Cannon with Protected Mounting</span></p>
</div>

<p>What the state of society was under feudal sovereignty is evident from
the notorious association formed for executing criminal justice; it was a
private tribunal, which, under the name of the <i>Vehmgericht</i>, held secret
sittings; its chief seat was the northwest of Germany. A peculiar peasant
association was also formed. In Germany the peasants were bondmen;
many of them took refuge in the towns, or settled down as freemen in
the neighbourhood of the towns (<i>Pfahlbürger</i>); but in Switzerland a peasant
fraternity was established. The peasants of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden
were under imperial governors; for the Swiss governments were not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
property of private possessors, but were official appointments of the empire.
These the sovereigns of the Habsburg line wished to secure to their own
house. The peasants, with club and iron-studded mace (<i>Morgenstern</i>), returned
victorious from a contest with the haughty steel-clad nobles, armed
with spear and sword, and practised in the chivalric encounters of the
tournament.</p>

<h5>INFLUENCE OF GUNPOWDER</h5>

<p>Another invention also tended to deprive the nobility of the ascendency
which they owed to their accoutrements&mdash;that of gunpowder. Humanity
needed it, and it made its appearance forthwith. It was one of the chief
instruments in freeing the world from the dominion of physical force and
placing the various orders of society on a level. With the distinction
between the weapons they used, vanished also that between lords and serfs.
And before gunpowder, fortified places were no longer impregnable, so that
strongholds and castles now lost their importance. We may indeed be led
to lament the decay or the depreciation of the practical value of personal
valour&mdash;the bravest, the noblest may be shot down by a cowardly wretch at
safe distance in an obscure lurking-place; but, on the other hand, gunpowder
has made a rational, considerate bravery, spiritual valour, the essential
to martial success.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p497.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Early Type of Mortar</span></p>
</div>

<p>Only through this instrumentality could that superior order of valour be
called forth&mdash;that valour in which the heat of personal feeling has no share;
for the discharge of firearms is directed against a body of men&mdash;an abstract
enemy, not individual combatants. The warrior goes to meet deadly peril
calmly, sacrificing himself for the commonweal; and the valour of civilised
nations is characterised by the very fact that it does not rely on the strong
arm alone, but places its confidence essentially in the intelligence, the generalship,
the character of its commanders, and, as was the case among the
ancients, in a firm combination and unity of spirit on the part of the forces
they command.</p>

<h5>MONARCHISM IN ITALY</h5>

<p>In Italy, as already noticed, we behold the same spectacle as in Germany&mdash;the
attainment of an independent position by isolated centres of power.
In that country, warfare in the hands of the condottieri became a regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
business. The towns were obliged to attend to their trading concerns, and
therefore employed mercenary troops, whose leaders often became feudal
lords; Francis Sforza even made himself duke of Milan. In Florence, the
Medici, a family of merchants, rose to power. On the other hand, the
larger cities of Italy reduced under their sway several smaller ones and
many feudal chiefs. A papal territory was likewise formed. There, also,
a very large number of feudal lords had made themselves independent; by
degrees they all became subject to the one sovereignty of the pope.</p>

<p>How thoroughly equitable in the view of social morality such a subjugation
was, is evident from Machiavelli’s celebrated work <i>The Prince</i>. This
book has often been thrown aside in disgust, as replete with the maxims of
the most revolting tyranny; but nothing worse can be urged against it than
that the writer, having the profound consciousness of the necessity for the
formation of a state, has here exhibited the principles on which alone states
could be founded in the circumstances of the times. The chiefs who
asserted an isolated independence, and the power they arrogated, must be
entirely subdued; and though we cannot reconcile with our idea of freedom
the means which he proposes as the only efficient ones, and regards as
perfectly justifiable&mdash;inasmuch as they involve the most reckless violence,
all kinds of deception, assassination, and so forth&mdash;we must nevertheless
confess that the feudal nobility, whose power was to be subdued, were assailable
in no other way, since an indomitable contempt for principle and an
utter depravity of morals were thoroughly engrained in them.</p>

<h5>IN FRANCE</h5>

<p>In France we find the converse of that which occurred in Germany and
Italy. For many centuries the kings of France possessed only a very small
domain, so that many of their vassals were more powerful than themselves;
but it was a great advantage to the royal dignity in France that the principle
of hereditary monarchy was firmly established there. The consideration
it enjoyed was increased by the circumstance that the corporations and
cities had their rights and privileges confirmed by the king, and that the
appeals to the supreme feudal tribunal&mdash;the court of peers, consisting of
twelve members enjoying that dignity&mdash;became increasingly frequent. The
king’s influence was extended by his affording that protection which only
the throne could give. But that which essentially secured respect for royalty,
even among the powerful vassals, was the increasing personal power of
the sovereign. In various ways, by inheritance, by marriage, by force of
arms, etc., the kings had come into possession of many earldoms (<i>Grafschaften</i>)
and several duchies. The dukes of Normandy had, however, become
kings of England; and thus a formidable power confronted France,
whose interior lay open to it by way of Normandy. Besides this there were
powerful duchies still remaining; nevertheless, the king was not a mere
feudal suzerain (<i>Lehnsherr</i>) like the German emperors, but had become a
territorial possessor (<i>Landesherr</i>); he had a number of barons and cities
under him, that were subject to his immediate jurisdiction; and Louis IX
succeeded in rendering appeals to the royal tribunal common throughout his
kingdom.</p>

<p>The towns attained a position of greater importance in the state. For
when the king needed money, and all his usual resources, such as taxes and
forced contributions of all kinds, were exhausted, he made application to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
towns and entered into separate negotiations with them. It was Philip the
Fair who, in the year 1302, first convoked the deputies of the towns as a
third estate, in conjunction with the clergy and the barons. All indeed that
they were in the first instance concerned with was the authority of the sovereign
as the power that had convoked them, and the raising of taxes as the
object of their convocation; the states nevertheless secured an importance
and weight in the kingdom, and as a natural result, an influence on legislation
also.</p>

<p>A fact which is particularly remarkable is the proclamation issued by the
kings of France, giving permission to the bondsmen on the crown lands to
purchase their freedom at a moderate price. In the way we have indicated
the kings of France very soon attained great power; while the flourishing
state of the poetic art in the hands of the troubadours, and the growth of the
scholastic theology, whose especial centre was Paris, gave France a culture
superior to that of the other European states, and which secured the respect
of foreign nations.</p>

<h5>IN ENGLAND</h5>

<p>William the Conqueror, duke of Normandy, introduced the feudal system
into England, and divided the kingdom into fiefs, which he granted almost
exclusively to his Norman followers. He himself retained considerable
crown possessions; the vassals were under obligation to perform service in
the field, and to aid in administering justice; the king was the guardian of
all vassals under age; they could not marry without his consent. Only by
degrees did the barons and the towns attain a position of importance. It was
especially in the disputes and struggles for the throne that they acquired
considerable weight.</p>

<p>When the oppressive rule and fiscal exactions of the kings became
intolerable, contentions and even war ensued; the barons compelled King
John to swear to Magna Charta, the basis of English liberty, <i>i.e.</i>, more particularly
of the privileges of the nobility. Among the liberties thus secured,
that which concerns the administration of justice was the chief; no Englishman
was to be deprived of personal freedom, property, or life without the
judicial verdict of his peers. Everyone, moreover, was to be entitled to
the free disposition of his property. Further, the king was to impose no
taxes without the consent of the archbishops, bishops, earls, and barons. The
towns, also, favoured by the kings in opposition to the barons, soon elevated
themselves into a third estate and to representation in the commons’ house
of parliament. Yet the king was always very powerful, if he possessed
strength of character: his crown estates procured for him due consideration;
in later times, however, these were gradually alienated, given away,
so that the king was reduced to apply for subsidies to the parliament.</p>

<p>We shall not pursue the minute and specifically historic details that
concern the incorporation of principalities with states, or the dissensions and
contests that accompanied such incorporations. We have only to add that
the kings, when by weakening the feudal constitution they had attained a
higher degree of power, began to use that power against each other in the
undisguised interest of their own dominion. Thus France and England carried
on wars with each other for a century. The kings were always endeavouring
to make foreign conquests; the towns, which had the largest share of
the burdens and expenses of such wars, were opposed to them, and in order
to placate them the kings granted them important privileges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span></p>

<h5>THE PAPACY AND FEUDALISM</h5>

<p>The popes endeavoured to make the disturbed state of society, to which
each of these changes gave rise, an occasion for the intervention of their
authority; but the interest of the growth of states was too firmly established
to allow them to make their own interest of absolute authority valid against
it. Princes and peoples were indifferent to papal clamour urging them to
new crusades. The emperor Louis set to work to deduce from Aristotle, the
Bible, and the Roman law a refutation of the assumptions of the papal see;
and the electors declared at the diet held at Rense in 1338, and afterwards
still more decidedly at the imperial diet held at Frankfort, that they
would defend the liberties and hereditary rights of the empire, and that to
make the choice of a Roman emperor or king valid, no papal confirmation was
needed. So, at an earlier date, 1302, on occasion of a contest between Pope
Boniface and Philip the Fair, the assembly of the states convoked by the
latter had offered opposition to the pope. For states and communities had
arrived at the consciousness of independent moral worth.</p>

<p>Various causes had united to weaken the papal authority; the great
schism of the church, which led men to doubt the pope’s infallibility, gave
occasion to the decisions of the councils of Constance and Bâle, which
assumed an authority superior to that of the pope, and therefore deposed and
appointed popes. The numerous attempts directed against the ecclesiastical
system confirmed the necessity of a reformation. Arnold of Brescia, Wycliffe,
and Huss met with sympathy in contending against the dogma of the papal
vicegerency of Christ, and the gross abuses that disgraced the hierarchy.
These attempts were, however, only partial in their scope. On the one hand
the time was not yet ripe for a more comprehensive onslaught; on the other
hand the assailants in question did not strike at the heart of the matter, but
(especially the two latter) attacked the teaching of the church chiefly with
the weapons of erudition, and consequently failed to excite a deep interest
among the people at large.</p>

<h5>HEGEL ON THE RISE OF MANKIND THROUGH FEUDALISM</h5>

<p>But the ecclesiastical principle had a more dangerous foe in the incipient
formation of political organisations than in the antagonists above referred to.
A common object, an aim intrinsically possessed of perfect moral validity, presented
itself to secularity in the formation of states; and to this aim of community
the will, the desire, the caprice of the individual submitted itself. The
hardness characteristic of the self-seeking quality of “heart,” maintaining its
position of isolation&mdash;the knotty heart of oak underlying the national temperament
of the Germans&mdash;was broken down and mellowed by the terrible
discipline of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The two iron rods which were the instruments of this discipline were the
church and serfdom. The church drove the “heart” (<i>Gemüth</i>) to desperation&mdash;made
spirit pass through the severest bondage, so that the soul was
no longer its own; but it did not degrade it to Hindu torpor, for Christianity
is an intrinsically spiritual principle and, as such, has a boundless elasticity.
In the same way serfdom, which made a man’s body not his own
but the property of another, dragged humanity through all the barbarism
of slavery and unbridled desire, and the latter was destroyed by its own
violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span></p>

<p>It was not so much from slavery as through slavery that humanity was
emancipated. For barbarism, lust, injustice constitute evil: man, bound fast
in its fetters, is unfit for morality and religiousness; and it is from this intemperate
and ungovernable state of volition that the discipline in question
emancipated him. The church fought the battle with the violence of rude
sensuality in a temper equally wild and terroristic with that of its antagonist;
it prostrated the latter by dint of the terrors of hell, and held it in
perpetual subjection, in order to break down the spirit of barbarism and to
tame it into repose.</p>

<p>Theology declares that every man has this struggle to pass through, since
he is by nature evil, and only by passing through a state of mental laceration
arrives at the certainty of reconciliation. But granting this, it must on the
other hand be maintained that the form of the contest is very much altered
when the conditions of its commencement are different, and when that
reconciliation has had an actual realisation. The path of torturous discipline
is in that case dispensed with (it does indeed make its appearance at a later
date, but in quite a different form), for the waking up of consciousness finds
man surrounded by the elements of a moral state of society. The phase of
negation is, indeed, a necessary element in human development, but it has
now assumed the tranquil form of education, so that all the terrible characteristics
of that inward struggle vanish.<span class="enanchor" id="crusades_enanchor_8c2"><a href="#crusades_endnote_8c">c</a></span></p>

HISTORY IN OUTLINE OF THE PAPACY</h4>

<div class="chronology">

<h5>THE BISHOPS OF ROME [42-590 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</h5>

<p>The early history of the Papacy is involved in much obscurity. For the early centuries we
shall attempt little more than to repeat the names of the successive bishops, as
accepted by the traditions of the church of Rome. According to these traditions,
the Apostle <b>Peter</b> founded the Church in the year 42 (modern criticism does not
accept this date, which is almost surely too early by about a score of years); he was
martyred in 67, and succeeded by <b>Linus</b>, who was followed in 79 by <b>Cletus</b> or
<b>Anacletus</b>. 91, <b>Clement I</b> or <b>Clemens Romanus</b>. Some writers make him the
third bishop in 68 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 100, <b>Evarestus</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">109</span> <b>Alexander I.</b> The political life of Rome extinguished by the empire, begins to revive
in the organisation of the Christian church. 119, <b>Sixtus I</b>. 129, <b>Telesphorus</b>.
139, <b>Hyginus</b>. 143, <b>Pius I</b>. 157, <b>Anicetus</b>. 168, <b>Soter</b>. 177, <b>Eleutherius</b>.
193, <b>Victor I</b>. The bishop of Rome is beginning to assume supremacy over other
bishops. This is resented in some quarters.</p>

<p><span class="year">202</span> <b>Zephyrinus.</b> 219, <b>Calixtus I</b>. 223, <b>Urban I</b>. 230, <b>Pontianus</b>. 235, <b>Anterius</b>.
236, <b>Fabianus</b>. 251, <b>Cornelius</b>. 252, <b>Lucius I</b>. 253, <b>Stephen I</b>. 257, <b>Sixtus II</b>.
259, <b>Dionysius</b>. 269, <b>Felix I</b>. 275, <b>Eutychianus</b>. 283, <b>Caius</b>. 296, <b>Marcellinus</b>.</p>

<p><span class="year">308</span> <b>Marcellus I.</b> 310, <b>Eusebius</b>. 311, <b>Melchiades</b>. 314, <b>Silvester I</b>. 325, The authority
of the metropolitan is distinctly recognised. The idea has been developing since
the primacy of Fabianus and Cornelius. 330, Removal of the capital from Rome to
Constantinople. This increases greatly the power of the Roman bishop, who henceforth
announces his supremacy in more decided tones. 336, <b>Marcus I</b>. 337, <b>Julius I</b>.
He is the recognised protector of the orthodox faith against Arianism and other
heresies. The church begins to organise landed properties by bequests from emperors
and nobles.</p>

<p><span class="year">352</span> <b>Liberius.</b> 356, First instance of schism in the church of Rome. <i>Felix</i> maintains a
rival claim to the primacy.</p>

<p><span class="year">366</span> <b>Damasus I</b> elected to the see, after a bitter and violent contest, over his rival, Ursinus.
Damasus represents the cause of orthodoxy. 384, <b>Siricius</b>. In his primacy the
decretals&mdash;pastoral letters&mdash;are begun.</p>

<p><span class="year">398</span> <b>Anastasius I.</b> The papacy has emerged from obscurity. Paganism is in its death
throes.</p>

<p><span class="year">402</span> <b>Innocent I.</b> He does much to free the church from political interference. 417, <b>Zosimus</b>.
He attempts to temporise with paganism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span></p>

<p><span class="year">418</span> <b>Boniface I.</b> His election is contested. <i>Eulalius</i> maintains a rival claim. The emperor
Honorius intervenes, and the provisions for election are revised. This is the first
instance of imperial interference.</p>

<p><span class="year">422</span> <b>Celestine I.</b> 432, <b>Sixtus III</b>. 440, <b>Leo (I) the Great</b>, sometimes called the real
founder of the papacy. The precedence of the bishops of Rome is now fully recognised.
461, <b>Hilarius</b>. 468, <b>Simplicius</b>. 476, The fall of the Western Empire
increases the bishops’ authority. 483, <b>Felix II</b> (or <b>III</b>, if the rival bishop in 356 is
reckoned as Felix II). He feels himself powerful enough to summon the patriarch
of Constantinople to Rome, and excommunicates him on his refusal to obey.
492, <b>Gelasius I</b>. He enunciates the principle that his acts are not to be controlled
by synods. 496, <b>Anastasius II</b>. 498, <b>Symmachus</b>. The election is contested by
<i>Laurentius</i>, who maintains a rival claim. The Palmary synod disavows its own right
to sit in judgment on the acts of the Roman bishop.</p>

<p><span class="year">514</span> <b>Hormisdas.</b> 523, <b>John I</b>. Theodoric sends John to Constantinople to obtain indulgence
for the Arians. Not entirely successful, Theodoric imprisons the bishop on
his return (525), and he dies the following year. 526, <b>Felix III</b> or <b>IV</b>. Dionysius
Exiguus collects and publishes the canons of the councils and the papal decretals.
530, <b>Boniface II</b>. His election contested by <i>Dioscorus</i> until the latter’s death, the
same year. Boniface obtains the power of appointing his own successor, but a
second synod annuls it.</p>

<p><span class="year">532</span> <b>John II.</b> 535, <b>Agapetus I</b>. Theodotus sends him to Constantinople in his behalf.
536, Belisarius enters Rome; the pope becomes the vassal of the emperor. <b>Silverius.</b>
537, Through the intrigues of the empress Theodora and the deacon Vigilius,
Silverius is deposed and banished to the island of Pandataria. <b>Vigilius</b> becomes
bishop of Rome. The bishops now become mere puppets of the Eastern court.</p>

<p><span class="year">552</span> Vigilius, resisting the will of Justinian, is imprisoned.</p>

<p><span class="year">553</span> Vigilius again seized, and sent to exile.</p>

<p><span class="year">554</span> <b>Pelagius I.</b> 560, <b>John III</b>. 574, <b>Benedict I</b>. 578, <b>Pelagius II</b>.</p>

<h5>FROM GREGORY THE GREAT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PAPACY AS
A LEGISLATIVE POWER [590-867 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</h5>

<p><span class="year">590</span> <b>Gregory (I) the Great</b> elected pope. He raises the papacy to eminence and determines
its future policy. Gregory’s work is of threefold character. (1) He perfects
the church ritual and introduces a new mode of chanting, and organises the revenues
of the church. (2) He exercises supreme authority over the churches of western
Europe. The Lombards are converted from Arianism, 599, and Britain is converted
by St. Augustine. (3) He makes the pope a temporal sovereign. By this time the
bishop of Rome has become the largest landholder in Italy. The Lombard invasion
has given the bishops opportunity for temporal control, and in Rome and its vicinity
the people recognise Gregory at the head of affairs.</p>

<h4 id="PAPACY_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I. ORIGIN AND RISE OF THE PAPACY</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[42-842 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Like almost all the great works of nature and of human power in the
material world and in the world of man, the papacy grew up in silence and
obscurity. The names of the earlier bishops of Rome are known only by
barren lists, by spurious decrees and epistles inscribed, centuries later, with
their names; by their collision with the teachers of heretical opinions, almost
all of whom found their way to Rome; by martyrdoms ascribed with the
same lavish reverence to those who lived under the mildest of the Roman
emperors, as well as those under the most merciless persecutors. Yet the
mythic or imaginative spirit of early Christianity has either respected, or was
not tempted to indulge its creative fertility by the primitive annals of Rome.
After the embellishment, if not the invention, of St. Peter’s pontificate, his
conflict with Simon Magus in the presence of the emperor, and the circumstance
of his martyrdom, it was content with raising the successive
bishops to the rank of martyrs without any peculiar richness or fullness
of legend.</p>

<p>The dimness and obscurity which veiled the growing church, no doubt
threw its modest concealment over the person of the bishop. He was but
one man, with no recognised function, in the vast and tumultuous population.
He had his unmarked dwelling, perhaps in the distant Transteverine
region, or in the then lowly and unfrequented Vatican. By the vulgar, he
was beheld as a Jew, or as belonging to one of those countless eastern religions,
which, from the commencement of the empire, had been flowing, each
with its strange rites and mysteries, into Rome. The emperor, the imperial
family, the court favourites, the military commanders, the consulars, the senators,
the patricians by birth, wealth, or favour, the pontiffs, the great lawyers,
even those who ministered to the public pleasures, the distinguished mimes
or gladiators, when they appeared in the streets, commanded more public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span>
attention than the Christian bishop, except when sought out for persecution
by some politic or fanatic emperor. Slowly, and at long intervals, did the
bishop of Rome emerge to dangerous eminence.</p>

<p>Christianity itself might seem, even from the first, to have disdained
obscurity&mdash;to have sprung up or to have been forced into terrible notoriety
in the Neronian persecution and the subsequent martyrdom of one at least,
according to the vulgar tradition, of its two great apostles. What caprice of
cruelty directed the attention of Nero to the Christians, and made him suppose
them victims important enough to glut the popular indignation at the
burning of Rome, it is impossible to determine. The cause and extent of
the Domitian persecution is equally obscure. The son of Vespasian was not
likely to be merciful to any connected with the fanatic Jews. Its known
victims were of the imperial family, against whom some crime was necessary,
and an accusation of Christianity served the end.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the second century, under Trajan, persecution
against the Christians is raging in the East. That, however, was a local or
rather Asiatic persecution, arising out of the vigilant and not groundless apprehension
of the sullen and brooding preparation for insurrection among the
whole Jewish race (with whom Roman terror and hatred still confounded
the Christians), which broke out in the bloody massacres of Cyrene and
Cyprus, and in the final rebellion during the reign of Hadrian, under Barchochebas
(Bar Koziba). But while Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, is carried
to Rome to suffer martyrdom, the Roman community is in peace, and not
without influence. Ignatius entreats his Roman brethren not to interfere
with injurious kindness between himself and his glorious death.</p>

<p>The wealth of the Roman community, and their lavish Christian use of
their wealth, by contributing to the wants of foreign churches, at all periods,
especially in times of danger and disaster (an ancient usage which lasted till
the time of Eusebius), testifies at once to their flourishing condition, to their
constant communication with more distant parts of the empire, and thus incidentally,
perhaps, to the class, the middle or mercantile class, which formed
the greater part of the believers.</p>

<p>But the history of Latin Christianity has not begun. For some considerable
(it cannot but be an undefinable) part of the first three centuries,
the church of Rome, and most, if not all the churches of the West, were, if
we may so speak, Greek religious colonies. Their language was Greek, their
organisation Greek, their writers Greek, their Scriptures Greek; and many
vestiges and traditions show that their ritual, their liturgy, was Greek.
Through Greek the communication of the churches of Rome and of the West
was constantly kept up with the East; and through Greek every heresiarch,
or his disciples, having found his way to Rome, propagated with more or less
success his peculiar doctrines. Pope Leo I (440-461) was the first celebrated
Latin preacher, and his brief and emphatic sermons read like the first essays
of a rude and untried eloquence, rather than the finished compositions which
would imply a long study and cultivation of pulpit oratory. Compare them
with Chrysostom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[42-312 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Africa, not Rome, gave birth to Latin Christianity. Tertullian was the
first Latin writer, at least the first who commanded the public ear; and
there is strong ground for supposing that, since Tertullian quotes the sacred
writings perpetually and copiously, the earliest of those many Latin versions,
noticed by Augustine, and on which Jerome grounded his Vulgate, were
African. Cyprian kept up the tradition of ecclesiastical Latin. Arnobius,
too, was an African.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521"></a>[521]</span></p>

<p>Thus the Roman church was but one of the confederation of Greek religious
republics, founded by Christianity. As of apostolic origin, still more
as the church of the capital of the world, it was, of course, of paramount dignity
and importance. It is difficult to exaggerate the height at which Rome,
before the foundation of Constantinople, stood above the other cities of the
earth; the centre of commerce, the centre of affairs, the centre of empire.
The Christians, like the rest of mankind, were constantly ebbing and flowing
out of Rome and into Rome. The church of the capital could not but assume
something of the dignity of the capital; it was constantly receiving, as it
were, the homage of all the foreign Christians, who, from interest, business,
ambition, curiosity, either visited or took up their residence in the Eternal
City.</p>

<p>But if Rome, or the church of Rome, was thus the centre of the more
peaceful influences of Christianity, and of the hopes and fears of the Christian
world, it was no less inevitably the chosen battle-field of her civil wars; and
Christianity has ever more faithfully recorded her dissensions than her conquests.
In Rome every feud which distracted the infant community reached
its height; nowhere do the judaising tenets seem to have been more obstinate,
or to have held so long and stubborn a conflict with more full and genuine
Christianity. In Rome every heresy, almost every heresiarch, found welcome
reception. All new opinions, all attempts to harmonise Christianity with the
tenets of the Greek philosophers, with the oriental religions, the cosmogonies,
the theophanies, and mysteries of the East, were boldly agitated, either
by the authors of the gnostic systems or by their disciples. Valentinus the
Alexandrian was himself in Rome, so also was Marcion of Sinope. The
Phrygian Montanus, with his prophetesses, Priscilla and Maximilla, if not
present, had their sect, a powerful sect, in Rome and in Africa. In Rome
their convert, for a time at least, was the pope; in Africa, Tertullian. Somewhat
later, the precursors of the great Trinitarian controversy came from
all quarters. Praxeas, an Asiatic; Theodotus, a Byzantine; Artemon, an
Asiatic; Noetus, a Smyrniote, at least his disciples the deacon Epigenes and
Cleomenes, taught at Rome. Sabellius, from Ptolemais in Cyrene, appeared
in person; his opinions took their full development in Rome. Not only do
all these controversies betray the inexhaustible fertility of the Greek or
eastern imagination, not only were they all drawn from Greek or oriental
doctrines, but they must have been still agitated, discussed, ramified into
their parts and divisions, through the versatile and subtile Greek. They
were all strangers and foreigners; not one of all these systems originated in
Rome, in Italy, or in Africa. On all these opinions the bishop of Rome was
almost compelled to sit in judgment; he must receive or reject, authorise
or condemn; he was a proselyte, whom it would be the ambition of all to
gain.</p>

<p>Thus, down to the conversion of Constantine, the biography of the
Roman bishops, and the history of the Roman episcopate, are one; the acts
and peculiar character of the pontiffs, the influence and fortunes of the see, excepting
in the doubtful and occasional gleams of light which have brought
out Victor, Zephyrinus, Calixtus, Cornelius, Stephen, into more distinct
personality, are involved in a dim and vague twilight. On the establishment
of Christianity, as the religion if not of the empire, of the emperor, the
bishop of Rome rises at once to the rank of a great accredited functionary;
the bishops gradually, though still slowly, assume the life of individual character.
The bishop is the first Christian in the first city of the world, and that
city is legally Christian. The supreme pontificate of heathenism might still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522"></a>[522]</span>
linger from ancient usage among the numerous titles of the emperor; but
so long as Constantine was in Rome, the bishop of Rome, the head of the emperor’s
religion, became in public estimation the equal, in authority and
influence immeasurably the superior, to all of sacerdotal rank. The schisms
and factions of Christianity now become affairs of state. As long as Rome
is the imperial residence, an appeal to the emperor is an appeal to the bishop
of Rome. It was the slow and imperceptible accumulation of wealth, the
unmarked ascent to power and sovereignty, which enabled the papacy to
endure for centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[312-395 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The obscurity of the bishops of Rome was not in this alone their strength.
The earlier pontiffs (Clement is hardly an exception) were men who of
themselves commanded no great authority, and awoke no jealousy. Rome
had no Origen, no Athanasius, no Ambrose, no Augustine, no Jerome. The
power of the hierarchy was established by other master-minds; by the
Carthaginian Cyprian, by the Italian Ambrose, the prelate of political
weight as well as of austere piety, by the eloquent Chrysostom. The names
of none of the popes, down to Leo and Gregory the Great, appear among
the distinguished writers of Christendom. This more cautious and retired
dignity was no less favourable to their earlier power, than to their later
claim of infallibility. If more stirring and ambitious men, they might have
betrayed to the civil power the secret of their aspiring hopes; if they had
been voluminous writers, in the more speculative times, before the Christian
creed had assumed its definite and coherent form, it might have been more
difficult to assert their unimpeachable orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The removal of the seat of empire to Constantinople consummated the separation
of Greek and Latin Christianity; one took the dominion of the East,
the other of the West. Greek Christianity has now another centre in the
new capital; and the new capital has entered into those close relations with
the great cities of the East, which had before belonged exclusively to Rome.
Alexandria has become the granary of Constantinople; her Christianity
and her commerce, instead of floating along the Mediterranean to Italy,
pour up the Ægean to the city on the Bosporus. The Syrian capitals,
Antioch, Jerusalem, the cities of Asia Minor and Bithynia, Ephesus, Nicæa,
Nicomedia, own another mistress. The tide of Greek trade has ebbed away
from the West, and found a nearer mart; political and religious ambition
and adventure crowd to the new eastern court. That court becomes the
chosen scene of Christian controversy; the emperor is the proselyte to gain
whom contending parties employ argument, influence, intrigue.</p>

<p>That which was begun by the foundation of Constantinople, was completed
by the partition of the empire between the sons of Constantine. There are
now two Roman worlds, a Greek, and a Latin. In one respect, Rome lost in
dignity, she was no longer the sole metropolis of the empire; the East no
longer treated her with the deference of a subject. On the other hand, she
was the uncontested, unrivalled head of her own hemisphere; she had no
rival in those provinces, which yet held her allegiance, either as to civil
or religious supremacy. The separation of the empire was not more complete
between the sons of Constantine or Theodosius, than between Greek
and Latin Christianity.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1b1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[42-395 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The advance of Christianity involved an emancipation of religion from
all political elements, and this was inevitably followed by the establishment
of a distinct ecclesiastical body, with a constitution peculiar to itself. In
this separation of the church from the state consists, perhaps, the most
important and most effectually influential peculiarity of Christian times.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523"></a>[523]</span>
The spiritual and temporal powers may come into close contact&mdash;they may
remain in the most intimate communion; but a perfect coalition can only
take place occasionally, and for short periods of time. In their reciprocal
relations and position with regard to each other, has since then been involved
one of the most important questions presented by all history.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">(From an old woodcut)</p>
</div>

<p>It was nevertheless imperative on the ecclesiastical body to form their
constitution on the model of that of the empire; and accordingly the hierarchy
of the bishops, metropolitan patriarchs, was formed in close correspondence
with the degradations of the civil power. No long time had
elapsed before the bishops of Rome acquired the supremacy. It is, indeed,
a vain pretence to assert that this supremacy was universally acknowledged
by East and West, even in the first century, or, indeed, at any time; but
it is equally certain that
they quickly gained a pre-eminence,
raising them far
above all other ecclesiastical
dignitaries. Many
causes concurred to secure
them this position; for
if the relative importance
of each provincial capital
secured to its bishop a
corresponding weight and
dignity, how much more
certainly would this result
take place as regarded the
ancient capital of the empire&mdash;that
city whence the
whole had derived its name?
Rome was, besides, one of
the most illustrious seats
of the apostles; here had
the greater number of the
martyrs shed their blood.
The bishops of Rome had
displayed the most undaunted
firmness throughout
the different persecutions,
and had sometimes
been scarcely installed in
their sacred office before
they followed their predecessor
in the path of that
martyrdom by which his seat had been vacated. In addition to all this, the
emperors now found it advisable to favour the advancement of a great
patriarchal authority. In a law that became decisive for the predominance
of Rome as well as of Christianity, Theodosius the Great commands that
all nations claiming the protection of his grace should receive the faith as
propounded by St. Peter to the Romans. Valentinian also forbade the
bishops, whether of Gaul or of other provinces, to depart from the received
customs of the church without the sanction of that venerable man, the pope
of the Holy City. Thenceforth the power of the Roman bishops advanced
beneath the protection of the emperor himself. But in this political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a>[524]</span>
connection lay also a restrictive force; had there been but one emperor, a
universal primacy might also have established itself; but this was prevented
by the partition of the empire. The emperors of the East were too eagerly
tenacious of their ecclesiastical rights to make it possible that they should
promote the extension of power desired by the western patriarchs in their
dominions. In this respect also the constitution of the church presents the
closest resemblance to that of the empire.</p>

<h5>THE PAPACY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FRANKISH EMPIRE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[312-754 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Scarcely was this great change completed, the Christian religion established,
and the church founded, when new events of great importance took
place; the Roman Empire, so long conquering and paramount, was now to see
itself assailed by its neighbours; in its turn it was invaded and overcome.</p>

<p>Amidst the general convulsion that ensued, Christianity itself received a
violent shock. In their terror, the Romans bethought themselves once more
of the Etruscan mysteries, the Athenians hoped to be saved by Achilles and
Minerva, the Carthaginians offered prayers to the genius Cœlestis; but these
were only temporary waverings, for even whilst the empire was shattered in
the western provinces, the church remained firm and undisturbed throughout
all. But she fell, as was inevitable, into many embarrassments, and found
herself in an entirely altered condition. A pagan people took possession of
Britain; Arian kings seized the greater part of the remaining West; while
the Lombards, long attached to Arianism, and as neighbours most dangerous
and hostile, established a powerful sovereignty before the very gates of
Rome.</p>

<p>The Roman bishops meanwhile, beset on all sides, exerted themselves
with all the prudence and pertinacity which have remained their peculiar
attributes to regain the mastery&mdash;at least in their ancient patriarchal diocese;
but a new and still heavier calamity now assailed them. The Arabs&mdash;not
conquerors merely, as were the Germans, but men inspired even to
fanaticism by an arrogant and dogmatising creed, in direct opposition to the
Christian faith&mdash;now poured themselves over the West as they had previously
done over the East. After repeated attacks, they gained possession of
Africa; one battle made them masters of Spain, their general Musa boasting
that he would march into Italy by the passes of the Pyrenees and
across the Alps, and cause the name of Mohammed to be proclaimed from
the Vatican.</p>

<p>This position was all the more perilous for the western portion of Roman
Christendom, from the fact that the iconoclastic dissensions were at that
time raging with the most deadly animosity on both sides. The emperor of
Constantinople had adopted the opposite party to that favoured by the pope
of Rome; nay, the life of the latter was more than once in danger from the
emperor’s machinations. The Lombards did not fail to perceive the advantages
derivable to themselves from these dissensions; their king Aistulf took
possession of provinces that till then had always acknowledged the dominion
of the emperor, and again advancing towards Rome, he summoned that city
also to surrender, demanding payment of tribute with vehement threats.</p>

<p>The Roman see was at this moment in no condition to help itself, even
against the Lombards, still less could it hope to contend with the Arabs, who
were beginning to extend their sovereignty over the Mediterranean, and were
threatening all Christendom with a war of extermination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span></p>

<p>But now the faith was no longer confined within the limits of the Roman
Empire. Christianity, in accordance with its original destiny, had long
overpassed these limits; more especially had it taken deep root among the
German tribes of the West; nay, a Christian power had already arisen among
these tribes, and towards this the pope had but to stretch forth his hands,
when he was sure to find the most effectual succour and earnest allies against
all his enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[496-715 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Among all the Germanic nations, the Franks alone had become Catholic
from their first rise in the provinces of the Roman Empire. This acknowledgment
of the Roman see had secured important advantages to the Frankish
nation. In the Catholic subjects of their Arian enemies, the western Goths
and Burgundians, the Franks found natural allies. We read so much of
the miracles by which Clovis was favoured&mdash;how St. Martin showed him the
ford over the Vienne by means of a hind, how St. Hilary preceded his armies
in a column of fire&mdash;that we shall not greatly err if we conclude these legends
to shadow forth the material succours afforded by the natives to those
who shared their creed, and for whom, according to Gregory of Tours,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1i"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1i">i</a></span> they
desired victory “with eager inclination.” But this attachment to Catholicism,
thus confirmed from the beginning by consequences so important, was
afterwards renewed and powerfully strengthened by a very peculiar influence
arising from a totally different quarter.</p>

<p>It chanced that certain Anglo-Saxons, being exposed for sale in the slave
market of Rome, attracted the attention of Pope Gregory the Great; he at
once resolved that Christianity should be preached to the nation whence these
beautiful captives had been taken. Never, perhaps, was resolution adopted
by any pope whence results more important ensued; together with the
doctrines of Christianity, a veneration for Rome and for the holy see, such
as had never before existed in any nation, found place among the Germanic
Britons. The Anglo-Saxons began to make pilgrimages to Rome; they
sent their youth thither to be educated, and King Offa established the tax
called “St. Peter’s penny” for the relief of pilgrims and the education of
the clergy. The higher orders proceeded to Rome, in the hope that, dying
there, a more ready acceptance would be accorded to them by the saints in
heaven. The Anglo-Saxons appear to have transferred to Rome and the
Christian saints the old Teutonic superstition, by which the gods were
described as nearer to some spots of earth than to others, and more readily
to be propitiated in places thus favoured.</p>

<p>But besides all this, results of higher importance still ensued when the
Anglo-Saxons transplanted their modes of thought to the mainland, and
imbued the whole empire of the Franks with their own opinion. Boniface
(originally Winfrid or Winfrith), the apostle of the Germans, was an Anglo-Saxon;
this missionary, largely sharing in the veneration professed by his
nation for St. Peter and his successors, had from the beginning voluntarily
pledged himself to abide faithfully by all the regulations of the Roman
see; to this promise he most religiously adhered. On all the German churches
founded by him was imposed an extraordinary obligation to obedience.
Every bishop was required expressly to promise that his whole life should be
passed in unlimited obedience to the Romish church, to St. Peter and his
representative. Nor did he confine this rule to the Germans only. The
Gallican bishops had hitherto maintained a certain independence of Rome;
Boniface, who had more than once presided in their synods, availed himself
of these occasions to impress his own views on this western portion of the
Frankish church; thenceforward the Gallic archbishops received their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
pallium from Rome, and thus did the devoted submission of the Anglo-Saxons
extend itself over the whole realm of the Franks.</p>

<p>The empire had now become the central point for all the German tribes
of the West. The fact that the reigning family, the Merovingian race, had
brought about its own destruction by its murderous atrocities had not
affected the strength of the empire. Another family, that of Pepin of
Heristal, had risen to supreme power&mdash;men of great energy, exalted force
of character, and indomitable vigour. While other realms were sinking
together into one common ruin, and the world seemed about to become the
prey of the Moslem, it was this race, the house of Pepin of Heristal, afterwards
called the Carlovingian, by which the first and effectual resistance
was offered to the Mohammedan conquerors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[395-715 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The religious development then in progress was also equally favoured by
the house of Pepin; we find it early maintaining the best understanding
with Rome, and it was under the special protection of Charles Martel and
Pepin le Bref that Boniface proceeded in his apostolic labours. Let us consider
the temporal condition of the papal power. On the one side the East
Roman Empire, weakened, fallen into ruin, incapable of supporting Christendom
against Islamism, or of defending its own domains in Italy against
the Lombards, yet continuing to claim supremacy even in spiritual affairs.
On the other hand, we have the German nations full of the most vigorous
life; victorious over the Moslem, attached with all the fresh ardour and trusting
enthusiasm of youth to that authority of whose protecting and restricting
influences they still felt the need, and filled with an unlimited and most
freely rendered devotion.</p>

<p>Already Gregory II perceived the advantages he had gained; full of a
proud self-consciousness, he writes thus to that iconoclast emperor, Leo the
Isaurian: “All the lands of the West have their eyes directed towards our
humility; by them are we considered as a God upon earth.” His successors
became ever more and more impressed with the conviction that it was needful
to separate themselves from a power (that of the Roman Empire) by
which many duties were imposed on them, but which could offer them no
protection in return. They could not safely permit a succession to the mere
name and empire to fetter them, but turned themselves rather towards those
from whom help and aid might also be expected. Thus they entered into
strict alliance with those great captains of the West, the Frankish monarchs;
this became closer and closer from year to year, procured important advantages
to both parties, and eventually exercised the most active influence on
the destinies of the world.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1c"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1c">c</a></span></p>

<p>With the division of the empire in the year 395, the question of the
Roman precedence of Constantinople was left for a time in abeyance; but
in the West the authority of the bishop of Rome became more and more
firmly established. In the following century the general conditions under
which he was called upon to act became so materially modified as to constitute
a new period in the history of our subject.</p>

<p>The characters of the men who filled the papal chair during this century,
most of them of exemplary life, some of commanding genius, would alone
suffice to constitute it a memorable era. “Upon the mind of Innocent I,”
says Milman,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1b2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1b">b</a></span> “seems first distinctly to have dawned the vast conception
of Rome’s universal ecclesiastical supremacy.” Innocent I (402-417) seems
indeed to have been the first of the popes who ventured to repudiate those
political conceptions which threatened to circumscribe the extending influence
of his office. Innocent was succeeded by Zosimus (417-418) and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span>
Boniface (418-422). The former, whose pontificate lasted only twenty-one
months, exhibits a noteworthy exception to the traditions of his see, in the
disposition he at one time showed to temporise with Pelagianism, and even
to set aside in its favour the decrees of his predecessor. The pontificate of
Boniface is notable as having been preceded by a contested election which
afforded the emperor Honorius an opportunity for the exercise of his intervention,
thereby establishing a precedent for imperial interference on like
occasions. At the instance of Boniface himself, Honorius enacted an ordinance
designed to avert the scandals incident to such contests. By the
new provisions, all canvassing for the vacant chair was strictly prohibited;
in the event of a disputed election both candidates were to be deemed
ineligible. The successor of Boniface was Celestine I (422-432). The evidence
afforded by the events of his pontificate is somewhat conflicting in
character. On the one hand, we find the churches of Africa putting forward
their latest recorded protest against the Roman pretensions, adducing
the sixth canon of the Council of Nicæa in support of their protest; on
the other hand, the success with which Celestine intervened in Illyricum, and
again in connection with the sees of Narbonne and Vienne, proves that the
papal jurisdiction was being accepted with increasing deference in other parts
of the empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[418-461 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Barbaric invasion, although resulting in the overthrow of many of the
institutions of civilisation, and in widespread suffering and social deterioration,
served but to enhance the influence and importance of the Roman see.
The apparent fulfilment of prophecy, pagan as well as Christian, when the
city was taken and sacked by Alaric (410), seemed to complete the effacement
of the temporal power in Rome. Neither the western emperors nor
the Gothic conquerors held their court in the ancient capital, where the pope
was now at once the most important and conspicuous authority. In the
African provinces, the demoralisation occasioned by the fierce controversies
and dissensions concerning Pelagianism and Donatism compelled the Catholic
communities to exchange their former attitude of haughty independence for
one of suppliant appeal, and to solicit the intervention and counsel which
they had before rejected. Such was the aspect of affairs in the West when
Leo the Great (440-461), by some regarded as the true founder of the mediæval
popedom, succeeded to the primacy. A citizen of Rome by birth, he
exemplified in his own character many of the ancient Roman virtues&mdash;a
tenacious adherence to tradition in matters of religious belief, an indomitable
resolution in the assertion of the prerogatives of his office, and the austere
practice of the recognised duties of social life. This rigid maintenance of
orthodoxy had been instilled into him (or at least confirmed) by the
exhortations of Augustine, with whom he had become personally acquainted
when on a mission to the African province; and before his election to the
papal office the celebrated Cassian had conceived so high an opinion of his
virtues and abilities as to dedicate to him his treatise on the Incarnation.
Regarded, indeed, simply as the able antagonist of the Manichæan and
Eutychian heresies, and as the first author of the collect, Leo would fill
no unimportant place in the annals of Latin Christendom; but his influence
on church history in other respects is of a far deeper and more potent kind.
In none was it followed by more important results than by the success with
which he established the theory that all bishops who, in questions of importance,
demurred to the decision of their metropolitan should be entitled to
appeal to Rome. He obtained the recognition of this principle not only in
Illyricum, as his predecessor Innocent had done, but also in Gaul; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
circumstances under which he did so in the latter province constitute the
whole proceedings a memorable episode in church history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[461-532 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The chief obstacle to the recognition of the supremacy of the Roman
pontiff was now to be found in the revival of Arianism, which, professed
alike by the Goth and the Vandal, represented the dominant faith in the chief
cities of northern Italy, as well as in Africa, Spain, and southern Gaul.
But the rivalry thus generated only increased the disposition of the Catholic
party to exalt the prerogatives of their head, and the attitude of Rome
towards other churches continued to be more and more one of unquestionable
superiority. In the year 483 Pope Felix II (or III)<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> ventured upon an
unprecedented measure in citing Acacius, the patriarch of Constantinople, to
Rome, to answer certain allegations preferred against him by John, patriarch
of Alexandria, whom he designated as “<i>frater et coepiscopus noster</i>” (Thiel,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1j"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1j">j</a></span>
<i>Epistolæ</i>, p. 239). On Acacius’ refusing to recognise the legality of the
letter of citation, he was excommunicated by Felix. The successor of Felix,
Gelasius I (492-496), refused to notify, as was customary, his election to
the patriarch of Constantinople, and by his refusal implicitly put forward a
fresh assumption, viz., that communion with Rome implied subjection to
Rome. Throughout the pontificate of Gelasius the primacy of the Roman
see was the burden of his numerous letters to other churches, and he appears
also to have been the first of the pontiffs to enunciate the view that the
authority which he represented was not controllable by the canons of synods,
whether past or present. In Italy these assumptions were unhesitatingly
accepted. The Palmary synod, as it was termed, convened in Rome during
the pontificate of Symmachus (498-514), formally disavowed its own right
to sit in judgment on his administrative acts. Ennodius, bishop of Pavia,
(<i>circa</i> 510), declared that the Roman pontiff was to be judged by God alone,
and was not amenable to any earthly potentate or tribunal. It is thus evident
that the doctrine of papal infallibility, though not yet formulated, was
already virtually recognised.</p>

<p>During the Gothic rule in Italy (493-553), its representatives manifested
the utmost tolerance in relation to religious questions, and showed little disposition
to impose any restraints on the policy of the popes, although each
monarch, by virtue of his title of “king of the Romans,” claimed the right
to veto any election to the papal chair. In the year 483, when Odoacer sent
his first lieutenant, Basilius, from Ravenna to Rome, the latter was invested
with the titles <i>eminentissimus</i> and <i>sublimis</i>. The pope accordingly appeared
as politically the subject of his Arian overlord. The advantage thus gained
by the temporal power appears to have been the result of its intervention,
which Simplicius (468-483) had himself solicited, in the elections to the papal
office, and one of the principal acts of the Palmary synod (above referred to)
was to repudiate the chief measures of Basilius, which had been especially
directed against the abuses that prevailed on such occasions, and more particularly
against bribery by alienation of the church lands. The assertion
of this authority on the part of the civil power was declared by the synod to
be irregular and uncanonical, and was accordingly set aside as not binding
on the church. The fierce contests and shameless bribery which now accompanied
almost every election were felt, however, to be so grave a scandal that
the synod itself deemed it expedient to adopt the ordinance issued by Basilius,
and to issue it as one of its own enactments. In order more effectually
to guard against such abuses, Boniface II, in the year 530, obtained from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529"></a>[529]</span>
synod specially convened for the purpose the power of appointing his own
successor, and nominated one Vigilius&mdash;the same who ten years later actually
succeeded to the office. But a second synod, having decided that such
a concession was contrary to the traditions of episcopal succession, annulled
the grant, and Boniface himself committed the former decree to the flames.
At his death, however, the recurrence of the old abuses in a yet more flagrant
form induced the senate to obtain from the court of Ravenna a measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
of reform of a more comprehensive character, and designed to check not only
the simoniacal practices within the church itself, but also the extortion of the
court officials.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[526-590 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the year 526 Dionysius Exiguus, a monk in Rome, undertook the
labour of preparing a new collection of the canons of the councils, and, finding
his production favourably received, proceeded also to compile a like
collection of the papal letters or decretals, from the earliest extant down to
those of Anastasius II in his own day. The letters of the popes were thus
placed on a level with the rescripts of the emperors, and in conjunction with
the canons formed the basis of the canon law, which afterwards assumed
such importance in connection with the history of the church. The negative
value of the collection formed by Dionysius may be said, however, almost to
equal that of its actual contents; for, from the simple fact that it does not
contain those yet earlier decretals subsequently put forth by the pseudo-Isidorus,
it affords the most convincing disproof of their genuineness.</p>

<p>The substitution of the rule of the Greek emperors for that of the Gothic
monarchs was inimical in almost every respect to the independence and reputation
of the popedom. For a short interval before Justinian landed in
Italy, Agapetus (535-536), appearing as the emissary of Theodotus to the
Eastern court, assumed a bearing which inspired the emperor himself with
respect, and his influence was sufficiently potent to procure the deposition of
one patriarch of the Eastern capital and to decide the election of another.
But, after Belisarius entered Rome and the city had been reduced to subjection,
the pontiff was seen to be the mere vassal of the emperor, and not only
of the emperor but of the courtesan on the imperial throne. The deposition of
Silverius (536-540), and his mysterious fate at Pandataria, together with
the elevation of Vigilius (540-555), the nominee of the abandoned Theodora
and her pliant slave, completed the degradation of the Roman see. Each
successive pope was now little more than a puppet which moved at the pleasure
of the Eastern court, and the <i>apocrisiarius</i> or deputy whom he maintained
at that court was generally (as in the case of Pelagius I, Gregory I, Sabinian,
Boniface III, Martin) his own successor&mdash;an honour purchased, it can
hardly be doubted, by systematic compliance with the imperial wishes. In
the career and fate of Vigilius the papal office was dishonoured as it had
never been before, at once by the signal unworthiness of its bearer and by
the indignities heaped upon him by the savage malice of his foes. So sinister,
indeed, had become the relations between the Roman bishop and the
eastern court that Pelagius I (555-560) is said to have besought Narses to
send him to prison rather than to Constantinople.</p>

<p>In the year 568 the Lombards invaded Italy. Like the Goths they became
converts to Arianism; but they were also far less civilised, and looked
with little respect on Roman institutions and Roman habits of thought, while
their arrogance, faithlessness, and cruelty gained for them the special detestation
of the Roman see. Their conquests did not extend over all Italy.
Ravenna and the Pentapolis, Venice, Rome, and its duchy (as the surrounding
district was then termed), Naples, Calabria, and Sicily, remained subject
to the empire. In the peninsula the pope was, after the exarch of Ravenna,
the most powerful potentate, and the presence of a common foe caused the
relations between himself and the empire to assume a more amicable character.
The emperor, indeed, continued to control the elections and to
enforce the payment of tribute for the territory protected by the imperial
arms; but on the other hand the pontiff exercised a definite authority
with the Roman duchy and claimed to have a voice in the appointment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>
the civil officers who administered the local government. From the time
of Constantine the Great the church had possessed the right of acquiring
landed property by bequests, and the Roman see had thus become greatly
enriched. Some of its possessions lay far beyond the confines of Italy.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1f"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1f">f</a></span></p>

<h5>GREGORY THE GREAT (590-604 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[42-590 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The papal monarchy thus rose insensibly upon the episcopal aristocracy.
From the first, the word of the successor of St. Peter as bishop of the Eternal
City had a high degree of authority. The title of “pope,” attributed in
theory to every bishop, was finally reserved for him of Rome alone, a change
already manifest under Leo the Great, but not completely brought about
until the time of Gregory VII. The bishop of Rome had possessed since the
days of the Roman Empire valuable property in the capital and throughout
Italy. He had even acquired some across the Alps, for example, in the province
of Arles, where he charged the bishop of that city with administering
it. Besides this he occupied in Rome itself, that is to say in the most famous
city in the world, that great estate which had been assigned to the
bishops by the municipal régime in the last days of the empire.</p>

<p>St. Leo (440-461) gave much prestige to his office by the great rôle he
played in public affairs and his successful intercession with Attila. He
obtained from Valentinian III a decree in which the emperor invited “the
entire church to recognise its head in order that peace might forever be preserved”;
and at the same period we see him restoring a Gallican bishop to
the see from which he had been driven, and transferring the metropolitan
seat from Arles to Vienne.</p>

<p>Under the Ostrogoths the church of Rome, treated elsewhere with leniency,
could make no progress. But when their power had fallen (553) and Rome
came once more under the authority of the emperor of Constantinople, the
great distance of her new master opened up a brighter future. The Lombard
invasion brought into the church’s territory a large number of refugees, and
the Roman population recovered some of its old energy in the double hatred
for barbarians and Arians. As for the exarch whom the eastern emperor
had charged with the government of his Italian provinces and invested with
direct authority over the dukes and military counts of Naples, Rome, Genoa,
etc., this official could scarcely make his authority felt in the western half of
Italy, relegated as he was to Ravenna, and separated from Rome by the
Lombard dominion which included Spoleto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[590-604 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It was at this juncture favourable, though dangerous in some respects,
that Gregory I appeared (590-604). Descended from the noble Anicia
family, Gregory added to distinction of birth every advantage of body and
mind. While under thirty he was prefect of Rome, but at the end of several
months he abandoned honours and thoughts of worldly things, and sought
the retirement of the cloister. But his reputation did not permit him the
obscurity he desired. Sent to Constantinople about 570 as secretary and
later as apocrisiary (a sort of grand almoner) by Pope Pelagius II, he rendered
valuable service to the holy see in its relations with the empire and in
its struggles with the Lombards. In 590 the clergy, the senate, and the
people raised him with one voice to the supreme pontificate, as successor to
Pelagius; but as all elections had to be confirmed by the emperor at Constantinople,
Gregory wrote in supplication that his might not be sanctioned.
The letter was intercepted, and Maurice’s orders of ratification
soon arrived. Gregory hid; he was discovered and brought back to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532"></a>[532]</span></p>

<p>Pope in spite of himself, he used all his talent and power to fortify the
papacy,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> propagate Christianity, and improve the discipline and organisation
of the church. Although he pleaded that the episcopacy, and especially his
own, “was the office of a shepherd of souls and not of a temporal prince,”
he did not neglect the temporal power of the holy see. It happened, since
the emperor was so little in touch with Italian affairs, that the soldiers
charged with defending Rome against the Lombards had received no pay.
Gregory paid them, took upon himself the work of defence, and armed
the clerics. When Agilulf, whose aggression had provoked these preparations,
was compelled to withdraw, Gregory treated with him in the name of
Rome, in spite of protests from the exarch.</p>

<p>Feeling thus strengthened in his position, he undertook to propagate
Christianity and orthodoxy both within and without the limits of the
ancient Roman Empire. Within its boundaries there were still some pagans
in Sicily, Sardinia, even at Terracina (Tarracina) at the very gates of Rome,
and doubtless also in some parts of Gaul, since there exists a decree of Childebert’s
dated 554, with the title <i>For the Abolition of the Remainder of
Idolatry</i>. There were Arians very close to Rome, the Lombards. By the
intervention of Queen Theudelinda, Gregory succeeded in having the heir
to the Lombard throne, Adalwald, raised in Catholicism. Since 587 the
Visigoths in Spain under Recared had been converted.</p>

<p>As for Great Britain, it was still entirely pagan, and Gregory sent thither
the monk Augustine and forty Roman missionaries (596). They landed on
the island of Thanet, and going from there sought Ethelbert, king of Kent,
who permitted them to preach their doctrines at Canterbury. From this
point Christianity spread rapidly towards the north and west, until by 627
it was firmly established in Northumberland. St. Augustine, archbishop of
Canterbury, had been named primate of England by Gregory the Great, with
whom he kept up a constant correspondence that is still in existence.</p>

<p>Ireland, “the isle of saints,” had already been converted, and now monks
were leaving it to win over the barbarians. At this period St. Columban,
the monk who denounced Brunehild’s crimes with such boldness, set out to
preach the Gospel to the mountaineers of Helvetia, and founded in their
midst abbeys surrounded by fertile fields. After him St. Rupert travelled
far into Bavaria and established the diocese of Salzburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533"></a>[533]</span></p>

<p>Thus Christianity spread its spirit of proselytism, and St. Gregory fostered
it greatly by the mild precepts he inculcated in his missionaries, and
the skill with which he facilitated the transition from pagan to Catholic.
He wrote to St. Augustine: “You must take care not to destroy the pagans’
temples, but only their idols; use holy water in washing out the edifice, build
altars and deposit relics in them. If their temples are well built, so much
the better; for it is important that these same ones pass from the cult of
demons to that of the true God. When the nation sees its ancient places
of worship remain, it will be more disposed to visit them through habit and to
worship the true God.”</p>

<p>At home Gregory laboured with success to co-ordinate the powers of the
church, in making recognised above everything that of the holy see. We
find him bestowing the title of vicar of the Gauls upon the bishop of Arles,
to correspond with Augustine archbishop of Canterbury, with the archbishop
of Seville for Spain, and him of Thessalonica for Greece; and finally sending
secret legates to Constantinople. In his pastoral which he wrote on the
occasion of his election, and which became a general regulation throughout
the West, he prescribed the bishops their duties according to the decision of
several councils. To bind the hierarchy together he sought to prevent the
encroachments of one bishop upon another. “I have given you Britain to
direct spiritually,” he wrote to the ambitious Augustine, “and not Gaul.”
He favoured the monasteries, looked with vigilance after their discipline, and
reformed church singing, substituting for the Ambrosian chant, “which,”
according to a contemporary, “was like the distant sound of a chariot rolling
over the stones,” that Gregorian chant which bears his own name.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1d"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1d">d</a></span></p>

<p>The darkest stain on the name of Gregory is his cruel and unchristian
triumph in the fall of the emperor Maurice&mdash;his base and adulatory praise
of Phocas, the most odious and sanguinary tyrant who had ever seized the
throne of Constantinople. It is the worst homage to religion to vindicate or
even to excuse the crimes of religious men; and the apologetic palliation,
or even the extenuation of their misdeeds rarely succeeds in removing, often
strengthens, the unfavourable impression.</p>

<p>Gregory was spared the pain and shame of witnessing the utter falsehood
of his pious vaticinations as to the glorious and holy reign of Phocas. In
the second year of the tyrant’s reign he closed the thirteen important years
of his pontificate. The ungrateful Romans paid but tardy honours to his
memory. His death (March 10th, 604) was followed by a famine, which the
starving multitude attributed to his wasteful dilapidation of the patrimony
of the church&mdash;that patrimony which had been so carefully administered
and so religiously devoted to their use. Nothing can give a baser notion
of their degradation than their actions. They proceeded to wreak their
vengeance on the library of Gregory, and were only deterred from their barbarous
ravages by the interposition of Peter the faithful archdeacon. Peter
had been interlocutor of Gregory in the wild legends contained in the
<i>Dialogues</i>.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1k1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1k">k</a></span> The archdeacon now assured the populace of Rome that he had
often seen the Holy Ghost in the visible shape of a dove hovering over the
head of Gregory as he wrote. Gregory’s successor therefore hesitated, and
demanded that Peter should confirm his pious fiction or fancy by an oath.
He ascended the pulpit, but before he had concluded his solemn oath he fell
dead. That which to a hostile audience might have been a manifest judgment
against perjury, was received as a divine testimony to his truth. The
Roman church has constantly permitted Gregory to be represented with the
Holy Ghost, as a dove, floating over his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534"></a>[534]</span></p>

<p>The historian of Christianity is arrested by certain characters and certain
epochs, which stand as landmarks between the close of one age of religion
and the commencement of another. Such a character is Gregory the Great;
such an epoch his pontificate, the termination of the sixth century. Gregory,
not from his station alone, but by the acknowledgment of the admiring world,
was intellectually, as well as spiritually, the great model of his age. He was
proficient in all the arts and sciences cultivated at that time; the vast volumes
of his writings show his indefatigable powers; their popularity and
their authority, his ability to clothe those thoughts and those reasonings in
language which would awaken and command the general mind.</p>

<p>His epoch was that of the final Christianisation of the world, not in outward
worship alone, not in its establishment as the imperial religion, the rise
of the church upon the ruin of the temple, and the recognition of the hierarchy
as an indispensable rank in the social system, but in its full possession of the
whole mind of man, in letters, arts as far as arts were cultivated, habits, usages,
modes of thought, and in popular superstition.</p>

<p>Not only was heathenism, but, excepting in the laws and municipal
institutions, Romanity itself absolutely extinct. The reign of Theodoric
had been an attempt to fuse together Roman, Teutonic, and Christian usages.
Cassiodorus, though half a monk, aspired to be a Roman statesman, Boethius
to be a heathen philosopher. The influence of the Roman schools of rhetoric
is betrayed even in the writers of Gaul, such as Sidonius Apollinaris;
there is an attempt to preserve some lingering cadence of Roman poetry in the
Christian versifiers of that age. At the close of the sixth century all this
has expired; ecclesiastical Latin is the only language of letters, or rather
letters themselves are become purely ecclesiastical. The fable of Gregory’s
destruction of the Palatine library is now rejected as injurious to his fame;
but probably the Palatine library, if it existed, would have been so utterly
neglected that Gregory would hardly have condescended to fear its influence.
His aversion to such studies is not that of dread or hatred, but of religious
contempt; profane letters are a disgrace to a Christian bishop; the truly
religious spirit would loathe them of itself.</p>

<p>What, then, was this Christianity by which Gregory ruled the world?
Not merely the speculative and dogmatic theology, but the popular, vital,
active Christianity, which was working in the heart of man; the dominant
motive of his actions, as far as they were affected by religion; the principal
element of his hopes and fears as regards the invisible world and that future
life which had now become part of his conscious belief.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Christian Mythology</span></h5>

<p>The history of Christianity cannot be understood without pausing at
stated periods to survey the progress and development of this Christian
mythology, which, gradually growing up and springing as it did from natural
and universal instincts, took a more perfect and systematic form, and at
length, at the height of the Middle Ages, was as much a part of Latin Christianity
as the primal truths of the Gospel. This growth, which had long
before begun, had reached a kind of adolescence in the age of Gregory, to
expand into full maturity during succeeding ages. Already the creeds of
the church formed but a small portion of Christian belief. The highest and
most speculative questions of theology, especially in Alexandria and Constantinople,
had become watchwords of strife and faction, had stirred the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535"></a>[535]</span>
passions of the lowest orders; the two natures, or the single or double will
in Christ, had agitated the workshop of the artisan and the seats in the circus.
Christ assumed gradually more and more of the awfulness, the immateriality,
the incomprehensibleness, of the Deity, and men sought out beings
more akin to themselves, more open, it might seem, to human sympathies.
Believers delighted in those ceremonials to which they might have recourse
with less timidity; the shrines and the relics of martyrs might deign to receive
the homage of those who were too profane to tread the holier ground. Already
the worship of these lower objects of homage begins to intercept that to the
higher; the popular mind is filling with images either not suggested at all, or
suggested but very dimly by the sacred writings; legends of saints are supplanting,
or rivalling at least, in their general respect and attention, the narratives
of the Bible.</p>

<p>Of all these forms of worship, the most captivating, and captivating to the
most amiable weaknesses of the human mind, was the devotion to the Virgin
Mary. The worship of the Virgin had first arisen in the East; and this
worship, already more than initiate, contributed, no doubt, to the passionate
violence with which the Nestorian controversy was agitated, while that controversy,
with its favourable issue to those who might seem most zealous for
the Virgin’s glory, gave a strong impulse to the worship. The denial of the
title “the mother of God,” by Nestorius, was that which sounded most offensive
to the general ear; it was the intelligible odious point in his heresy.
The worship of the Virgin now appears in the East as an integral part of
Christianity. Among Justinian’s splendid edifices arose many churches
dedicated to the mother of God. The feast of the Annunciation is already
celebrated under Justin and Justinian. Heraclius has images of the Virgin
on his masts when he sails to Constantinople to overthrow Phocas. Before
the end of the century the Virgin is become the tutelar deity of Constantinople,
which is saved by her intercession from the Saracens.</p>

<h5>WORSHIP OF THE VIRGIN</h5>

<p>In the time of Gregory the worship of the Virgin had not assumed that rank
in Latin Christianity to which it rose in later centuries, though that second
great impulse towards this worship, the unbounded admiration of virginity,
had full possession of his monastic mind. With Gregory celibacy was the
perfection of human nature; he looked with abhorrence on the contamination
of the holy sacerdotal character, even in its lowest degree, by any sexual
connection. No subdeacon, after a certain period, was to be admitted without
a vow of chastity; no married subdeacon to be promoted to a higher
rank. In one of his expositions he sadly relates the fall of one of his aunts,
a consecrated virgin; she had been guilty of the sin of marriage. Of all his
grievances against the exarch of Ravenna, none seems more worthy of complaint
than that he had encouraged certain nuns to throw off their religious
habits and to marry. Gregory does not seem to have waged this war against
nature, however his sentiments were congenial with those of his age, with his
wonted success.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> His letters are full of appeals to sovereigns and to bishops
to repress the incontinence of the clergy; even monasteries were not absolutely
safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536"></a>[536]</span></p>

<h5>ANGELS AND DEVILS</h5>

<p>It was not around the monastery alone, the centre of this preternatural
agency, that the ordinary providence of God gave place to a perpetual interposition
of miraculous power. Every Christian was environed with a world
of invisible beings, who were constantly putting off their spiritual nature and
assuming forms, uttering tones, distilling odours, apprehensible by the soul of
man, or taking absolute and conscious possession of his inward being. A
distinction was drawn between the pure, spiritual, illimitable, incomprehensible
nature of the Godhead, and the thin and subtile but bodily forms of
angels and archangels. These were perceptible to the human senses, wore
the human form, spoke with human language; their substance was the thin
air, the impalpable fire; it resembled the souls of men, but yet, whenever
they pleased, it was visible, performed the functions of life, communicated
not with the mind and soul only but with the eye and ear of man.</p>

<p>The hearing and the sight of religious terror were far more quick and
sensitive. The angelic visitations were but rare and occasional; the more
active demons were ever on the watch, seizing and making every opportunity
of beguiling their easy victims. They were everywhere present, and
everywhere betraying their presence. They ventured into the holiest places;
they were hardly awed by the most devout saints; but, at the same time
there was no being too humble, to whose seduction they would not condescend&mdash;nothing
in ordinary life so trivial and insignificant but that they
would stoop to employ it for their evil purposes. They were without the
man, terrifying him with mysterious sounds and unaccountable sights. They
were within him, compelling all his faculties to do their bidding, another indwelling
will besides his own, compelling his reluctant soul to perform their
service. Every passion, every vice, had its especial demon; lust, impiety,
blasphemy, vainglory, pride were not the man himself, but a foreign power
working within him. The slightest act, sometimes no act at all, surrendered
the soul to the irresistible indwelling agent. In Gregory’s
<i>Dialogues</i><span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1k2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1k">k</a></span> a woman eats a lettuce without making the sign of the cross; she
is possessed by a devil, who had been swallowed in the unexorcised lettuce.
Another woman is possessed for admitting her husband’s embraces the night
before the dedication of an oratory.</p>

<h5>MARTYRS AND RELICS</h5>

<p>Happily there existed, and existed almost at the command of the clergy,
a counterworking power to this fatal diabolic influence, in the perpetual
presence of the saints, more especially in hallowed places, and about their
own relics. These relics were the treasure with which the clergy, above all
the bishops of Rome, who possessed those of St. Peter and St. Paul with
countless others, ruled the mind; for by these they controlled and kept in
awe, they repaired the evils wrought by this whole world of evil spirits.
Happy were the churches, monasteries, whose foundations were hallowed and
secured by these sacred talismans. To doubt their presence in these dedicated
shrines, in the scenes of their martyrdom, obstinately to require the
satisfaction of the senses as to their presence, was an impious want of faith;
belief, in proportion to the doubtfulness of the miracle, was the more meritorious.
Kings and queens bowed in awe before the possessors and dispensers
of these wonder-working treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537"></a>[537]</span></p>

<p>Relics had now attained a self-defensive power; profane hands which
touched them withered; and men who endeavoured to remove them were
struck dead. Such was the declaration of Gregory himself, to one who had
petitioned for the head or some part of the body of St. Paul. It was an awful
thing even to approach to worship them. Men who had merely touched the
bones of St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Lawrence, though with the pious design
of changing their position or placing the scattered bones together, had fallen
dead, in one case to the number of ten. The utmost that the church of
Rome could bestow would be a cloth which had been permitted to touch
them; and even such cloths had been known to bleed. If, indeed, the chains
of St. Paul would yield any of their precious iron to the file, which they often
refused to do, this, he writes, he would transmit to the empress; and he
consoles her for the smallness of the gift by the miraculous power which it
will inherently possess.</p>

<p>Gregory doled out such gifts with pious parsimony. A nail which contained
the minutest filings from the chains of St. Peter was an inestimable
present to a patrician, or an ex-consul, or a barbaric king. Sometimes they
were inserted in a small cross; in one instance with fragments of the gridiron
on which St. Lawrence was roasted. One of the golden nails of the
chains of St. Peter had tempted the avarice of a profane, no doubt a heathen
or Arian, Lombard; he took out his knife to sever it off; the awe-struck
knife sprang up and cut his sacrilegious throat. The Lombard king
Authari and his attendants were witnesses of the miracle, and stood in
terror, not daring to lift the fearful nail from the ground. A Catholic was
fortunately found, by whom the nail permitted itself to be touched; and this
peerless gift, so avouched, Gregory sends to a distinguished civil officer.</p>

<h5>SANCTITY OF THE CLERGY</h5>

<p>That sanctity which thus dwelt in the relics of the saints, was naturally
gathered, as far as possible, around their own persons by the clergy, hallowed
as they were and set apart by their ordination from the common race of man;
and if the hierarchy had only wielded this power for self-protection, if they
had but arrayed themselves in this defensive awe against the insults and
cruelties of barbarians, such as the Lombards are described, it would be
stern censure which would condemn even manifest imposture. We might
excuse the embellishment, even the invention of the noble story of the bishop
Sanctulus, who offered his life for that of a captive deacon, before whom the
Lombard executioner, when he lifted up his sword to behead him, felt his
arm stiffen, and could not move it till he had solemnly sworn never to raise
that sword against the life of a Christian. But this conservative respect for
the sanctity of their order darkens too frequently into pride and inhumanity;
the awful inviolability of their persons becomes a jealous resentment against
even unintentional irreverence. A demoniac accused the holy bishop
Fortunatus of refusing him the rights of hospitality; a poor peasant
receives the possessed into his house, and is punished for this inferential
disrespect to the bishop by seeing his child cast into the fire and burned
before his eyes. A poor fellow with a monkey and cymbals is struck dead
for unintentionally interrupting a bishop Boniface in prayer.</p>

<p>The sacred edifices, the churches, especially, approachable to all, were yet
approachable not without profound awe; in them met everything which
could deepen that awe; within were the relics of the tutelar saint, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538"></a>[538]</span>
mysteries, and the presence of the Redeemer, of God himself; beneath were
the remains of the faithful dead.</p>

<p>Burial in churches had now begun; it was a special privilege. Gregory
dwells on the advantage of being thus constantly suggested to the prayers
of friends and relatives for the repose of the soul. But that which was
a blessing to the holy was but more perilous to the unabsolved and the
wicked. The sacred soil refused to receive them; the martyrs appeared
and commanded the fetid corpses to be cast out of their precincts. They
were seized by devils, who did not fear to carry off their own even from
those holy places. But oblations were still effective after death. The consecrated
host has begun to possess in itself wonder-working powers. A child
is cast forth from his grave, and is only persuaded to rest in quiet by a piece
of the consecrated bread being placed upon his breast. Two noble women,
who had been excommunicated for talking scandal, were nevertheless buried
in the church; but every time the mass was offered, their spirits were seen
to rise from their tombs and glide out of the church. It was only after an
oblation had been “immolated” for them that they slept in peace.</p>

<h5>STATE AFTER DEATH</h5>

<p>The mystery of the state after death began to cease to be a mystery. The
subtile and invisible soul gradually materialised itself to the keen sight of
the devout. A hermit declared that he had seen Theodoric, the Ostrogothic
king, at the instant of death, with loose garments and sandals, led between
Symmachus the patrician and John the pope, and plunged into the burning
crater of Lipari. Benedict, while waking, beheld a bright and dazzling light,
in which he distinctly saw the soul of Germanus, bishop of Capua, ascend to
heaven in an orb of fire, borne by angels.</p>

<p>Hell was by no means the inexorable dwelling which restored not its
inhabitants. Men were transported thither for a short time, and returned to
reveal its secrets to the shuddering world. Gregory’s fourth book is entirely
filled with legends of departing and of departed spirits, several of which
revisit the light of day. On the locality of hell Gregory is modest, and
declines to make any peremptory decision. On purgatory, too, he is dubious,
though his final conclusion appears to be that there is a purgatorial fire which
may purify the soul from very slight sins. Some centuries must elapse before
those awful realms have formed themselves into that dreary and regular
topography which Dante partly created out of his own sublime imagination,
partly combined from all the accumulated legends.</p>

<p>The most singular of these earlier journeys into the future world are the
adventures of a certain Stephen, the first part of which Gregory declares he
had heard more than once from his own mouth, and which he relates, apparently
intending to be implicitly believed. Stephen had to all appearance died
in Constantinople, but, as the embalmer could not be found, he was left unburied
the whole night. During that time he went down into hell, where he
saw many things which he had not before believed. But when he came
before the Judge, the Judge said, “I did not send for this man, but for
Stephen the smith.” Gregory’s friend Stephen was too happy to get back,
and on his return found his neighbour Stephen the smith dead. But Stephen
learned not wisdom from his escape. He died of the plague in Rome,
and with him appeared to die a soldier, who returned to reveal more of these
fearful secrets of the other world, and the fate of Stephen. The soldier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539"></a>[539]</span>
passed a bridge, beneath it flowed a river, from which rose vapours, dark,
dismal, and noisome. Beyond the bridge (the imagination could but go
back to the old Elysian fields) spread beautiful, flowery, and fragrant
meadows, peopled by spirits clothed in white. In these were many mansions,
vast and full of light. Above all rose a palace of golden bricks; to
whom it belonged he could not read. On the bridge he recognised Stephen,
whose foot slipped as he endeavoured to pass. His lower limbs were immediately
seized by frightful forms, who strove to drag him to the fetid dwellings
below. But white and beautiful beings caught his arms, and there was
a long struggle. The soldier did not see the issue of the conflict.</p>

<p>Such were among the stories avouched by the highest ecclesiastical
authority, and commended it might seem by the uninquiring faith of the
ruling intellect of his age&mdash;such among the first elements of that universal
popular religion which was the Christianity of ages. This religion gradually
moulded together all which arose out of the natural instincts of man, the
undying reminiscences of all the older religions, the Jewish, the pagan, and
the Teutonic, with the few and indistinct glimpses of the invisible world
and the future state of being in the New Testament, into a vast system,
more sublime perhaps for its indefiniteness, which, being necessary in that
condition of mankind, could not but grow up out of the kindled imagination
and religious faith of Christendom. And such religion the historian
who should presume to condemn as a vast plan of fraud, or a philosopher who
should venture to disdain as a fabric of folly only deserving to be forgotten,
would be equally unjust, equally blind to its real uses, assuredly ignorant
of its importance and its significance in the history of man. For on this,
the popular Christianity, turns the whole history of man for centuries.</p>

<p>It is at once the cause and the consequence of the sacerdotal dominion
over mankind; the groundwork of authority at which the world
trembled; which founded and overthrew kingdoms, bound together or set
in antagonistic array nations, classes, ranks, orders of society. Of this, the
parent, when the time arrived, of poetry, of art, the Christian historian must
watch the growth and mark the gradations by which it gathered into itself
the whole activity of the human mind, and quickened that activity till at
length the mind outgrew that which had been so long almost its sole occupation.
It endured till faith, with the schoolmen, led into the fathomless depths
of metaphysics, began to aspire after higher truths; with the reformers,
attempting to refine religion to its primary spiritual simplicity, gradually
dropped, or left but to the humblest and most ignorant, at least to the more
imaginative and less practical part of mankind, this even yet prolific legendary
Christianity, which had been the accessory and supplementary Bible, the
authoritative and accepted, though often unwritten, Gospel of centuries.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1b3"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>GREGORY’S SUCCESSORS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[604-649 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Gregory left the papal chair far more securely settled on the lofty eminence
where it had been placed than it was when he ascended it. But
Sabinian, who succeeded him, expressed little gratitude for the service he
had thus performed; indignant at finding the treasury exhausted of its
gold, he accused him of having ruined the see by his liberality; and would
have proceeded, but for the menaces of both the clergy and the people, publicly
to burn his writings. He did not live long after this attempt; and his
sudden death was ascribed to a blow on the head inflicted by the angry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540"></a>[540]</span>
shade of the departed saint. A truer cause, however, may be found, perhaps,
in the fact that he had made himself hated by the populace, by withdrawing
the accustomed alms, that he might heal, as he pretended, the
injuries inflicted by the liberality of Gregory; a mode of proceeding so
little relished by his flock, that, whatever share they might have in his
death, they conveyed his breathless body with contempt out of the city.</p>

<p>It was during the pontificate of Boniface III, who resided as Gregory’s
legate at the court of Constantinople, and owed his elevation to the emperor,
that the Roman pontiff was first dignified with the much-disputed title of
universal bishop. For this honour Boniface was indebted to the enmity existing
between Phocas and the patriarch of his imperial city. He lived to enjoy
his triumph only a few months; and several of his successors seem to have
contented themselves with the duties of their station, without entering into
direct collision with any rival in authority. It is, however, a singular
circumstance, that to the attempts of Boniface IV, who obtained the papal
dignity immediately after the pontiff just named, to bring back the separatists
from Rome to her communion, a resistance was made by the celebrated
Irish apostle Columbanus, breathing much of the freedom and intelligence of
later days.</p>

<p>Honorius, who succeeded to the papacy after the two unimportant
pontificates of Deusdedit (Deodatus or Adeodatus I) and Boniface V, made
a vain attempt to influence the Lombards to restore their king, Adalwald
(Adalvaldus), whom they had deposed as a madman, and elected in his place
an Arian named Ariwald (Ariovaldus). But the most conspicuous circumstance
in his career was his agreement with Sergius, the patriarch of
Constantinople, in establishing the celebrated edict by which it was
intended to put an end to the monothelite controversy,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and render the
renewal of it a crime against the laws of the empire. Yet Honorius, in
the Sixth General Council, was solemnly anathematised, and classed with
the known and most violent supporters of the monothelite heresy.</p>

<p>The death of this pontiff was followed by the pillage of the palace of the
Lateran&mdash;an outrage which had its origin with the emperor, and was committed
by his own officers. Severinus was then placed in the papal chair,
but his pontificate was not marked by any important event. The same
observation applies to those of his successors, John IV and Theodore.
Theodore was succeeded by Martin I, the earliest act of whose pontificate
was the calling of a council to condemn the principles of the monothelites,
and the late acts of the emperors. The assembly held its first session
October 5th, 649; in the fifth and last, which was held on the 31st of
October, twenty articles were drawn up against the heresy in question, and
its authors, Theodorus, Cyrus, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paul, together with
all such as should embrace their opinions, were formally anathematised.</p>

<p>The Roman pontiff was by this proceeding brought into immediate
collision with the emperor; and the power of the greatest potentate of the
church was thus measured with that of the highest in the state. In this
respect the issue of the controversy deserves particular note. Martin was a
zealous and active churchman, learned and conscientious, strongly impressed
with a sense of the importance of unity, and disposed to exercise the
authority he possessed to the utmost in its favour. No sooner had
the council given its decision, than he despatched letters to all orders of the
clergy, acquainting them with the event and with the acts it had passed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541"></a>[541]</span>
But the information which the emperor Constans received of these proceedings
filled him with the most violent indignation; and he at once resolved to
punish the contempt with which his edict, and that of his predecessor, had
been treated. He communicated his wishes to Calliopas, exarch of Italy,
who soon after made the pontiff a prisoner and conveyed him to the island
of Naxos. For three months he was kept nearly continually on board a ship,
and carried from one place to the other, without being allowed even the
commonest necessaries of life. At Naxos he remained twelve months in
captivity; and was then taken to Constantinople, being exposed, during his
passage thither, to a treatment which would have been cruel to a condemned
malefactor. On his arrival, fresh indignities and barbarities awaited him.
He was cast into a miserable prison, in which he lay apparently forgotten
for more than three months, and when carried before the tribunal of justice was
examined like a common criminal. The part he had taken in the late events,
so far as they strictly pertained to religion, was not considered even by his
fiercest opponents as involving a guilt sufficient to justify their severities.
He was, therefore, arraigned as an enemy of the state. Twenty witnesses,
of whom the greater part were soldiers, and who are said to have been
bribed for the occasion, appeared as his accusers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[649-682 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This mockery of a trial being concluded, the pontiff was carried to an
open terrace, where, exposed at once to the gaze of the emperor and the populace,
the base servants of the court insulted him in so gross a manner
that even the multitude pitied his fate. His outward mantle having been
torn off, the officers took him, and stripping off the best of his habits, left
only his tunic remaining, which they next rent down on each side, from top
to bottom. An iron collar was then fastened round his neck, and he was led
from the palace through the midst of the city, chained to one of the keepers
of the prison, and preceded by another bearing the sword with which he was
to be executed. As they dragged him along, his lacerated feet stained the
pavement with blood; and he presented an appearance of humiliation and
misery which might well humble the spirits of the haughtiest churchmen of
either Rome or Constantinople. But his sufferings did not terminate here.
Instead of being executed he was sent into the Chersonesus where he lingered
through four months of the severest hardship, then expired. He was succeeded
as pope by Eugenius, indebted for his elevation to the influence of the
imperial court and his too ready tolerance of its reigning errors. He was
consequently regarded at Rome with equal suspicion and dislike. Vitalian,
the successor of Eugenius, had the merit of being a strict disciplinarian, and
of sending Theodore to England as archbishop of Canterbury. At his death,
Adeodatus (Deodatus II) was elected. It was in the pontificate of his
successor Domnus that the church of Ravenna became permanently incorporated
with that of Rome.</p>

<p>Agatho, the next pope, was not less conspicuous for the devoutness of his
character; and the story which is told of his curing by a kiss some leprous
person whom he accidentally met, indicates not merely the growing superstition
of the age, but the influence which the pontiff’s piety had made upon
the minds of the people. At his request it was that the emperor Constantine
Pogonatus assembled the Sixth General Council; and it is somewhat singular
to find that one of the main objects which his legates laboured at obtaining
was a reduction of the sum usually paid by the newly elected pontiff
into the imperial treasury. For this indulgence, Agatho willingly confirmed
the ancient law, that no pope should be ordained till his election had been
formally recognised and confirmed at Constantinople. The harmony which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542"></a>[542]</span>
thus existed between the emperor and Agatho was happily continued through
the pontificate of Leo II, in whose favour the monarch decreed that the new
archbishop of Ravenna should receive his ordination at the hands of the
pope. He possessed sufficient interest at the court of the emperor to obtain
the important privilege for the Roman pontiffs, of being confirmed in their
authority by the exarch of Ravenna, instead of having to make the long and
difficult journey to Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[682-701 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The pontificate of John V was as unimportant as it was short; he was
succeeded by Conon. Next, Sergius occupied the papal chair to the beginning
of the eighth century; but, at the commencement of his pontificate,
he saw himself opposed by two powerful rivals, and the palace of the
Lateran was for some time
besieged with open force by
the partisans of these pretenders
to the papacy. The
contest was continued for
a considerable period. Sergius,
though supported by
imperial influence, had to
endure a seven years’ exile
before he could possess himself
of the dignity; and on
his refusal to recognise the
canons of the council <i>in
trullo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> was assailed by Justinian
II with all the weapons
of imperial authority.
The conflict was thus renewed,
which had so long
disturbed the peace of
Christendom; and another
starting-point given, from
which the two great candidates
for universal and
unlimited power were to
begin the race. It is evident
that the pontiff had
not yet acquired strength
sufficient to oppose his rival
with certainty of success.
At the council of Toledo,
held in the year 688, the archbishop of that city obtained a resolution in
favour of his opinions, which not simply established his creed in opposition to
that of the pontiff, but was couched in terms of haughty defiance and rebuke.
The contest, therefore, was as yet unattended by palpable prognostics of the
final triumph of the papacy.</p>

</div>

<p>The troubles which the church had suffered from the continual motions
of half-barbarian hordes were many and severe, but they produced an equivalent
advantage. Amid all the struggles to which churchmen were urged
by ambition, they displayed, as a body, some of the noblest instances of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543"></a>[543]</span>
charity, of care for the poor and distressed, which the world had seen.
Pressed by the frequent prospect of immediate ruin, they simultaneously
acquired the virtues of resignation and the skill of politicians. It was to
them the people owed their preservation when threatened on the one side
by foreign enemies, and on the other by the tyranny of their rulers; and
till they themselves became oppressors, popular liberty found its best champions
among the heads of the church. But when the progress of Christianity
itself is considered&mdash;that is, the very interests for which the church, with
all its attendant powers, was called into existence&mdash;doubt and dissatisfaction
are almost the invariable result of the inquiry. In Rome, piety was
shocked by the open contests which repeatedly took place by candidates for
the papal dignity, and by the little less disgraceful plots with which the
contending parties prepared for the onset. The provinces, perpetually appealed
to on the subject of obedience to the supreme pontiff, saw their own
pastors at one time yielding with submissive complacence to his decrees, at
another resisting them both openly and in secret.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[701-731 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Sergius was succeeded by John VI (701), in whose pontificate Campania
was invaded by the Lombards, under Gisulf, duke of Benevento. His successor,
John VII (705), is noted only for having been guilty of the weakness
of returning the canons of the council <i>in trullo</i> to the emperor Justinian,
without a single alteration. In his pontificate, moreover, the king of the Lombards
restored the lands of which he had despoiled the church, and the deed
which contained the grant was written in letters of gold. Sisinius was the
next pontiff; but he died a few days after his election, and left the see to
Constantine, a native of Syria, who retained it about seven years. He was
summoned by Justinian to the capital of the East; but the object which the
emperor had in view is unknown, and the only result of his journey seems to
have been the restoration of Felix, the archbishop of Ravenna, to his diocese
and honours. That unfortunate prelate had made an effort to recover the
independence possessed by the former bishops of his see; but, though aided
by the warlike masters of the district, his attempt failed; and the emperor
sending a body of troops from Sicily, the walls of Ravenna were beaten down,
and Felix, loaded with chains, was carried a prisoner to Constantinople.
There he had to endure the punishment inflicted on the basest criminals.
His eyes were put out, and he was banished to the inhospitable shores of
Pontus&mdash;a punishment, it is said, which was regarded at Rome as the
infliction of divine justice.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the want of positive evidence as to the express object
of Constantine’s journey, it is usually believed to have been occasioned by
the emperor’s unceasing anxiety to secure the co-operation of the Roman
hierarchy in the establishment of the late decrees. It is also argued, and
with seeming reason, that his attendance on the imperial commands is a proof
of the still unavoidable subjection which the pontiffs had to endure; while
his failing to oppose the canons so objectionable to his church affords a similar
proof of his weakness and his fears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[715-741 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Gregory II, by whom he was succeeded (715), pursued a bolder line of
conduct.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The part which he took in opposition to Leo the Isaurian has been
already stated; and his determined attack on the Lombards, who made
themselves masters of one of the Neapolitan fortresses, indicated the spirit
which, in later times, placed Christian prelates at the head of mail-clad
armies. Gregory was in all respects the firm defender and zealous advocate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544"></a>[544]</span>
of papal authority. At one moment engaged in open hostilities with the
emperor, he was at another employed in directing the labours of missionaries
and founding monasteries. Germany, at his direction, was traversed by the
ardent and pious Boniface; and in Italy the rule of St. Benedict became,
under his patronage, the universal canon of monastic institutions.</p>

<p>The pontificate of Gregory II lasted sixteen years, and he was succeeded
by a priest of the same name, whom the people elected by some sudden
impulse, while engaged in the obsequies of the former. Gregory III (731-741)
carried the principles which had actuated his predecessor to a far
greater extent. Unable to withdraw the emperor Leo, either by persuasion
or threats, from the vigorous persecution of iconoclasm, he proceeded to
the daring measure of excommunicating the sovereign, and then made known
to the celebrated Charles Martel his readiness to proclaim him consul of
Rome, on condition that he would enable him to support his separation from
the dominion of the empire. Leo resented the conduct of the pontiff, by
depriving him of part of his revenues and rejecting his legates. But the
step which Gregory had taken led directly to the establishment of the papacy
on the basis of temporal power and grandeur. A new career, new motives
to exertion, were opened to the politicians of the church; and it was no
longer with rival prelates the bishops of Rome were to contend, but with
states and princes. The prizes for which they were henceforth to strive
were to be tributary crowns and sceptres&mdash;the triumphs they were to celebrate,
not those of truth over heresy, but of arbitrary superstition over the
free-will, the natural sentiments, and the evangelical knowledge of Christian
nations.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1g"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1g">g</a></span></p>

<p>That reign of terror known as the struggle of the iconoclasts has been
alluded to already in the history of the Byzantine Empire. It may also be
summed up here with its consequences.</p>

<h5>DRAPER ON THE ORIGIN OF ICONOCLASM</h5>

<p>Three causes gave rise to iconoclasm, or the revolt against image-worship;
first, the remonstrances and derision of the Mohammedans; second, the good
sense of a great sovereign, Leo the Isaurian, who had risen by his merit from
obscurity, and had become the founder of a new dynasty at Constantinople;
third, the detected inability of these miracle-working idols and fetiches
to protect their worshippers or themselves against an unbelieving enemy.
Moreover, an impression was gradually making its way among the more
intelligent classes that religion ought to free itself from such superstitions.
So important were the consequences of Leo’s actions, that some have been
disposed to assign to his reign the first attempt at making policy depend on
theology; and to this period they therefore refer the commencement of the
Byzantine Empire. Through one hundred and twenty years, six emperors
devoted themselves to this reformation. But it was premature. They were
overpowered by the populace and the monks, by the bishops of Rome, and by
a superstitious and wicked woman.</p>

<p>It had been a favourite argument against the pagans how little their gods
could do for them when the hour of calamity came, when their statues and
images were insulted and destroyed; and hence how vain was such worship,
how imbecile such gods. When Africa and Asia, full of relics and crosses,
pictures and images, fell before the Mohammedans, those conquerors retaliated
the same logic with no little effect. There was hardly one of the fallen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545"></a>[545]</span>
towns that had not some idol for its protector. Remembering the stern
objurgations of the prophet against this deadly sin, prohibited at once by the
commandment of God and repudiated by the reason of man, the Saracen caliphs
had ordered all the Syrian images to be destroyed. Amid the derision
of the Arab soldiery and the tears of the terror-stricken worshippers, these
orders were remorselessly carried into effect, except in some cases where
the temptation of an enormous ransom induced the avengers of the unity of
God to swerve from their duty. Thus the piece of linen cloth on which
it was feigned that our Saviour had impressed his countenance, and which was
the palladium of Edessa, was carried off by the victors at the capture of that
town, and subsequently sold to Constantinople at the profitable price of twelve
thousand pounds of silver. This picture, and also some other celebrated ones,
it was said, possessed the property of multiplying themselves by contact with
other surfaces, as in modern times we multiply photographs. Such were the
celebrated images “made without hands.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">[726 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It was currently asserted that the immediate origin of iconoclasm was due
to the caliph Yazid, who had completed the destruction of the Syrian images,
and to two Jews, who stimulated Leo the Isaurian to his task. However
that may be, Leo published an edict (726 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), prohibiting the worship of
images. This was followed by another directing their destruction, and the
whitewashing of the walls of churches ornamented with them. Hereupon
the clergy and the monks rebelled; the emperor was denounced as a Mohammedan
and a Jew. He ordered that a statue of the Saviour in that part of
the city called Chalcopratia should be removed, and a riot was the consequence.
One of his officers mounted the ladder and struck the idol with an
axe upon its face; it was an incident like that enacted centuries before in
the temple of Serapis at Alexandria. The sacred image, which had often
arrested the course of nature and worked many miracles, was now found to
be unable to protect or to avenge its own honour. A rabble of women interfered
in its behalf; they threw down the ladder and killed the officer; nor
was the riot ended until the troops were called in and a great massacre perpetrated.
The monks spread the sedition in all parts of the empire; they
even attempted to proclaim a new emperor. Leo was everywhere denounced
as a Mohammedan infidel, an enemy of the mother of God; but with inflexible
resolution he persisted in his determination as long as he lived.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1h"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1h">h</a></span></p>

<h5>MILMAN ON ICONOCLASM</h5>

<p>Iconoclasm was an attempt by the Eastern emperor to change by his own
arbitrary command the religion of his subjects. No religious revolution has
ever been successful which has commenced with the government. Such
revolutions have ever begun in the middle or lower orders of society, struck
on some responsive chord of sympathy in the general feeling, supplied some
religious want, stirred some religious energy, and shaken the inert strength of
the established faith by some stronger counter emotion.</p>

<p>Whatever the motives of the emperor Leo the Isaurian (and on this subject,
as in all the religious controversies where the writings of the unsuccessful
party were carefully suppressed or perished through neglect, authentic
history is almost silent), whether he was actuated by a rude aversion to
what perhaps can hardly yet be called the fine arts with which Christianity
was associating itself, or by a spiritual disdain and impatience of the degrading
superstition into which the religion of the Gospel had so long been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546"></a>[546]</span>
degenerating, the attempt was as politically unwise and unseasonable as the
means employed were despotic and altogether unequal to the end. The time
was passed, if it had ever been, when an imperial edict could change, or
even much affect, the actual prevailing religion of the empire. For this was
no speculative article of belief, no question of high metaphysical theology,
but a total change in the universal popular worship, in the spirit and in the
essence, if not of the daily ritual, of countless observances and habitual
practices of devotion. It swept away from almost all the churches of the
empire objects hallowed by devotion, and supposed to be endowed with
miraculous agency; objects of hope and fear, of gratitude and immemorial
veneration. It not merely invaded the public church, and left its naked
walls without any of the old remembrancers of faith and piety; it reached
the private sanctuary of prayer. No one could escape the proscription;
learned or unlearned, priest or peasant, monk or soldier, clergyman or layman,
man, woman, and even child were involved in the strife. Something to
which their religious attachments clung, to which their religious passions were
wedded, might at any time be forcibly rent away, insulted, trampled under
foot; that which had been their pride and delight could only now be furtively
visited, and under the fear of detection.</p>

<p>Nor was it possible for this controversy to vent itself in polemic writings.
Here actual, personal, furious collision of man and man, of faction
and faction, of armed troops against armed troops, was inevitable. The
contending parties did not assail each other with mutual anathemas, which
they might despise, or excommunication and counter excommunication, the
validity of which might be questioned by either party. On one side it was
a sacred obligation to destroy, to mutilate, to dash to pieces, to deface the
objects on which the other had so long gazed with intense devotion, and
which he might think it an equally sacred obligation to defend at the sacrifice
of life. It was not a controversy, it was a feud; not a polemic strife,
but actual war declared by one part of Christendom against the other. It
was well perhaps for Christendom that the parties were not more equally
balanced; that, right or wrong, one party in that division of the Christian
world, where total change would have been almost extermination, obtained a
slow but complete triumph.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1b4"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<p>Milman then goes on to plead eloquently for the encouragement of the
fine arts by the church which produced a Raphael and a Michelangelo, as
the Greek religion produced and employed its Phidias and Praxiteles. He
then proceeds to describe the ferocity of the dissension.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#papacy_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>THE WAR OF ICONOCLASM</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[726-731 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A formidable insurrection broke out in Greece and in the Ægean islands.
A fleet was armed, a new emperor, one Cosmas, proclaimed, and Constantinople
menaced by the rebels. The fleet, however, was scattered and
destroyed by ships which discharged the Greek fire; the insurrection was
suppressed, the leaders either fell or were executed, along with the usurper.
The monks here and throughout the empire, the champions of this as of
every other superstition, were the instigators to rebellion. Few monasteries
were without some wonder-working image; the edict struck at once at their
influence, their interest, their pride, their most profound religious feelings.</p>

<p>But the more eminent clergy were likewise at first almost unanimous in
their condemnation of the emperor. Constantine, bishop of Nacolia, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547"></a>[547]</span>
is branded as his adviser. Another bishop, Theodosius, son of Apsimarus,
metropolitan of Ephesus, is named as entering into the war against images.
But almost for the first time the bishops of the two Romes, Germanus of
Constantinople and Pope Gregory II, were united in one common cause.
Leo attempted to win Germanus to his views, but the aged patriarch (he
was now ninety-five years old) calmly but resolutely resisted the arguments,
the promises, the menaces of the emperor.</p>

<p>But the conduct of Gregory II, as leading to more important results,
demands more rigid scrutiny. The Byzantine historians represent him as
proceeding, at the first intimation of the hostility of the emperor to image-worship,
to an act of direct revolt, as prohibiting the payment of tribute by
the Italian province. This was beyond the power, probably beyond the
courage, of Gregory. The
great results of the final
separation of the West from
the inefficient and inglorious
sovereignty of the East
might excuse or palliate, if
he had foreseen them, the
disloyalty of Pope Gregory
to Leo. But it would be
to estimate his political and
religious sagacity too highly
to endow him with this gift
of ambitious prophecy, to
suppose him anticipating
the full development of
Latin Christianity when it
should become independent
of the East.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/p547.jpg" width="350" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Mosaic, Representing the Temporal and Spiritual
Power of Jesus Christ</span></p>
</div>

<p>Like most ordinary
minds, and if we are to
judge by his letters Gregory’s
was a very ordinary
mind, he was merely governed
by the circumstances
and passions of his time
without the least foreknowledge
of the result of
his actions. The letter
of Pope Gregory to the emperor (729 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) is arrogant without dignity,
dogmatic without persuasiveness; in the stronger part of the argument far
inferior, both in skill and ingenuity, to that of the aged Germanus, or the
writer who guided his pen. The strange mistakes in the history of the Old
Testament, the still stranger interpretations of the New, the loose legends
which are advanced as history, give a very low opinion of the knowledge
of the times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[731-742 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>When Gregory addressed this and a second letter to the emperor Leo, the
tumult in Constantinople, the first public act of rebellion against iconoclasm,
had taken place; but the aged bishop Germanus was not yet degraded from
his see. Germanus, with better temper and more skilful argument, had
defended the images of the East. Before his death (731), he was deposed or
compelled to retire from his see. He died most probably in peace; his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548"></a>[548]</span>
extreme age may well account for his death. His personal ill treatment by
the emperor is the legend of a later age to exalt him into a martyr.</p>

<p>But these two powerful prelates were not the only champions of their
cause whose writings made a strong impression on their age. It is singular
that the most admired defender of images in the East was a subject not of
the emperor but of the Mohammedan sultan. John of Damascus was famed
as the most learned man in the East, and it may show either the tolerance,
the ignorance, or the contempt of the Mohammedans for these Christian
controversies, that writings which became celebrated all over the East should
issue from one of their capital cities, Damascus.</p>

<p>In the West, all power, almost all pretension to power, excepting over
Sicily and Calabria, expired with Leo;<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and this independence partly arose
out of and was immeasurably strengthened by the faithful adherence of the
West to image-worship.</p>

<h5>CONSTANTINE COPRONYMUS (741-775 A.D.)</h5>

<p>Leo was succeeded by his son Constantine. The name by which this
emperor was known is a perpetual testimony to the hatred of a large part of
his subjects. Even in his infancy he was believed to have shown a natural
aversion to holy things, and in his baptism to have defiled the font. Constantine
Copronymus sounded to Greek ears as a constant taunt against his
filthy and sacrilegious character.</p>

<p>The accession of Constantine (741), although he had already been acknowledged
for twenty years with his father as joint emperor, met formidable
resistance. The contest for the throne was a strife between the two religious
parties which divided the empire. During the absence of Constantine,
on an expedition against the Saracens, a sudden and dangerous insurrection
placed his brother-in-law, Artavasdes, on the throne. Constantinople was
gained to the party of the usurper by treachery. The city was induced to submit
to Artavasdes only by a rumour, industriously propagated and generally
believed, of the death of Constantine. The emperor on one occasion had
been in danger of surprise, and escaped by the swiftness of his horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[742-746 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the capital, as throughout Greece and the European part of the empire,
the triumph of Artavasdes was followed by the restoration of the images.
Anastasius, the dastard patriarch of Constantinople, as he had been the slave
of Leo, now became the slave of the usurper, and worshipped images with the
same zeal with which he had destroyed them. He had been the principal
actor in the deception of the people by the forged letters which announced the
death of Constantine. He plunged with more desperate recklessness into
the party of Artavasdes. The monks, and all over whom they had influence,
took up the cause of the usurper; but the mass of the people, from royal
respect for the memory of Leo, or from their confidence in the vigorous
character of Constantine and attachment to the legitimate succession, from
indifference or aversion to image-worship, still wavered, and submitted rather
than clamorously rejoiced in the coronation of Artavasdes.</p>

<p>But Constantine Copronymus with the religious opinions inherited the
courage, the military abilities, and the popularity with the army which had
distinguished his father Leo. After some vicissitudes, a battle took place
near Ancyra, fought with all the ferocity of civil and religious war. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549"></a>[549]</span>
an obstinate resistance, and after having suffered all the horrors of famine,
Constantinople was taken. Artavasdes was punished by the loss of his eyes.</p>

<p>Constantine was a soldier, doubtless of a fierce temper; the blinding and
mutilation of many, the beheading a few of his enemies, the abandonment
of the houses of the citizens to the plunder of his troops, was the natural
course of Byzantine revolution; and these cruelties have no doubt lost nothing
in the dark representations of the emperor’s enemies, the only historians
of the times. But they suffered as rebels in arms against their sovereign, not
as image-worshippers. The fate of the patriarch Anastasius was the most
extraordinary. His eyes were put out, he was led upon an ass, with his face
to the tail, through the city; and after all this mutilation and insult, for
which, considering his tergiversation and impudent mendacity, it is difficult
to feel much compassion, he was reinstated in the patriarchal dignity. The
clergy in the East had never been arrayed in the personal sanctity which, in
ordinary occasions, they possessed in the West; but could Constantine have
any other object in this act than the degradation of the whole order in
public estimation?</p>

<h5>THIRD COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE (746 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[746-766 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>For ten years Constantine refrained from any stronger measures against
image worship. In the tenth year of Constantine rumours spread abroad of
secret councils held for the total destruction of images. Either the emperor
must have prepared the public mind for this great change with consummate
address, or reverence for images must have been less deeply rooted in the East
than in the West, otherwise it can scarcely be supposed that so large a number
of the clergy as appeared at the Third Council of Constantinople (746) would
have slavishly assented to the strong measures of the emperor. Three hundred
and forty-eight bishops formed this synod.</p>

<p>Part of the proceedings of this assembly have been preserved in the
records of the rival council, the second held in Nicæa. The passages are
cited in the original words, followed by a confutation, sanctioned apparently
by the Nicene bishops. The Council of Constantinople proscribes the
lawless and blasphemous art of painting. The fathers of Constantinople
assume, as boldly as the brethren of Nicæa their sanctity, that all images are
the invention of the devil; that they are idols in the same sense as those
of the heathen. Nor do they hesitate to impute community of sentiment
with the worst heretics to their opponents. They thought that they held
the image-worshippers in an inextricable dilemma. If the painters represented
only the humanity of Christ, they were Nestorians; if they attempted to
mingle it with the divinity, they were Eutychians, circumscribing the infinite
and confounding the two substances. It was impiety to represent Christ
without his divinity, Arianism to undeify him, despoil him of his godhead.</p>

<p>The Council of Nicæa admits the perfect unanimity of the Council of
Constantinople. These 348 bishops concurred in pronouncing their anathema
against all who should represent the incarnate Word by material form
or colours, who should not restrict themselves to the pure spiritual conception
of the Christ, as he is seated, superior in brightness to the sun, on the right
hand of the Father; against all who should confound the two natures of
Christ in one human image, or who should separate the manhood from the
Godhead in the second person of the indivisible Trinity; against all who
should not implore the intercession of the Virgin in pure faith, as above
all visible and invisible things; against all who should set up the deaf and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550"></a>[550]</span>
lifeless images of saints, and who do not rather paint the living likenesses of
their virtues in their own hearts. All images, whether statues or paintings,
were to be forcibly removed from the churches; everyone who henceforth
should set up an image, if a bishop or priest, was to be degraded; if a layman,
excommunicated. They proceed to curse by name the principal asserters
of image-worship. “Anathema against the double-minded Germanus, the
worshipper of wood! Anathema against George (of Cyprus), the falsifier of
the traditions of the fathers! Anathema against Mansar (they called by this
unchristian-sounding name the famous John of Damascus), the Saracen in
heart, the traitor to the empire&mdash;Mansar the teacher of impiety, the false
interpreter of Holy Scripture!”</p>

<p>Thus was image-worship proscribed by a council, in numbers at least of
weight, in the severest and most comprehensive terms. The work of demolition
was committed to the imperial officers; only with strict injunctions, not
perhaps always obeyed, to respect the vessels, the priestly vestments, and
other furniture of the churches, and the cross, the naked cross without any
image. The crucifix was of a later period.</p>

<h5>THE WAR ON MONASTERIES</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[766-775 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>But if the emperor had overawed, or bought, or compelled the seemingly
willing assent of so large a body of the eastern clergy, the formidable monks
were still in obstinate implacable opposition to his will. It was now fanaticism
encountering fanaticism. Everywhere the monks preached resistance
to the imperial decree, and enough has been seen of their turbulent and
intractable conduct to make us conclude that their language at least would
keep no bounds. Stephen, the great martyr of this controversy, had lived
as a hermit in a cave near Sinope for thirty years.</p>

<p>The emperor sent the patriarch to persuade him to subscribe the decrees
of the Council of Constantinople. The patriarch’s eloquence was vain. The
emperor either allowed or compelled the aged monk to retire to the wild
rock of Proconnesus, where, to consummate his sanctity, he took his stand
upon a pillar. His followers assembled in crowds about him, and built their
cells around the pillar of the saint. But the zeal of Stephen would not be
confined within that narrow sphere. He returned to the city, and in bold
defiance of the imperial orders denounced the iconoclasts. He was seized,
cast into prison, and there treated with unusual harshness. But even there
the zeal of his followers found access. Constantine exclaimed, in a paroxysm
of careless anger, “Am I or this monk the emperor of the world?” The
word of the emperor was enough for some of his obsequious courtiers; they
rushed, broke open the prison, dragged out the old man along the streets
with every wanton cruelty, and cast his body at last into the common grave
of the public malefactors.</p>

<p>The emperor took now a sterner and more desperate resolution. He
determined to root out monkery itself. The monks were driven from their
cloisters, which were given up to profane and secular uses. Consecrated
virgins were forced to marry; monks were compelled, each holding the hand
of a woman, doubtless not of the purest character, to walk round the Hippodrome
among the jeers and insults of the populace. Throughout the whole
empire they were exposed to the lawless persecutions of the imperial officers.
Their zeal or their obstinacy was chastised by scourgings, imprisonments,
mutilations, and even death. The monasteries were plundered, and by no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551"></a>[551]</span>
scrupulous or reverent hands; churches are said to have been despoiled of
all their sacred treasures, the holy books burned, feasts and revels profaned
the most hallowed sanctuaries.</p>

<p>Multitudes fled to the neighbouring kingdoms of the less merciless barbarians;
many found refuge in the West, especially in Rome. The prefect
of Thrace was the most obsequious agent of his master’s tyranny. The
patriarch himself was accused of having used disrespectful language towards
the emperor. Already he had been required to acquit himself of imputing
Nestorianism to his master; now his accusers swore on the cross that they
had heard him hold conference with one of the conspirators. Constantine
ordered the imperial seal to be affixed on the palace of the patriarch, and
sent him into banishment.</p>

<p>For some new offence, real or supposed, the exiled patriarch was brought
back to the capital, scourged so cruelly that he could not walk, and then
carried in a litter, and exposed in the great church before all the people
assembled to hear the public recital of the charges made against him, and to
behold his degradation. At each charge the secretary of his successor smote
him on the face. He was then set up in the pulpit, and while Nicetas
read the sentence of excommunication, another bishop stripped him of his
metropolitan pall, and calling him by the opprobrious name Scotiopsis,
“face of darkness,” led him backwards out of the church. The next day his
head, beard, eyebrows were shaved; and as we have already said, he was put
upon an ass, and paraded through the circus (his own nephew, a hideous,
deformed youth, leading the ass), while the populace jeered, shouted, spat
upon him. He was then thrown down, trodden on, and in that state lay till
the games were over. Some days after the emperor sent to demand a formal
declaration of the orthodoxy of his own faith and of the authority of the
council. The poor wretch acknowledged both in the amplest manner; as a
reward he was beheaded, while still in a state of excommunication, and his
remains treated with the utmost ignominy.</p>

<p>This odious scene, blackened it may be by the sectarian hatred of the
later annalists, all of whom abhorred iconoclasm, has been related at length,
in order to contrast more fully the position of the bishop of Rome. This
was the second patriarch of Constantinople who had been thus barbarously
treated, and seemingly without the sympathy of the people; and now, in
violation of all canonical discipline, the imperial will had raised a eunuch
to the patriarchate. What wonder that pontiffs like Gregory II and
Gregory III should think themselves justified in throwing off the yoke of
such a government, and look with hope to the sovereignty of the less
barbarous barbarians of the north&mdash;barbarians who, at least, had more
reverence for the dignity of the sacerdotal character.</p>

<p>If the Byzantine historians, all image-worshippers, have not greatly exaggerated
the cruelties of their implacable enemy Constantine Copronymus,
they have assuredly not done justice to his nobler qualities, his valour, incessant
activity, military skill, and general administration of the sinking empire,
which he maintained unviolated by any of its formidable enemies, and with imposing
armies, during a reign of thirty-five years, not including the twenty
preceding during which he ruled as the colleague of his father Leo. Constantine
died, during a campaign against the Bulgarians, of a fever which, in
the charitable judgment of his adversaries, gave him a foretaste of the pains
of hell. His dying lips ordered prayers and hymns offered to the Virgin,
for whom he had always professed the most profound veneration, utterly inconsistent,
his enemies supposed, with his hostility to her sacred images.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552"></a>[552]</span></p>

<h5>HELENA AND IRENE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[775-787 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A female had been the principal mover in the great change of Christianity
from a purely spiritual worship to that paganising form of religion which
grew up with such rapidity in the succeeding centuries; a female was the
restorer of images in the East, which have since, with but slight interruption,
maintained their sanctity. The first, Helena, the mother of Constantine the
Great, was a blameless and devout woman, who used the legitimate influence
of her station, munificence, and authority over her imperial son, to give that
splendour which to her piety appeared becoming to the new religion; to
communicate to the world all those excitements of symbols, relics, and sacred
memorials which she found so powerful in kindling her own devotion. The
second, the empress Irene, wife to the son and heir of Constantine Copronymus,
an ambitious, intriguing, haughty princess, never lost sight of political
power in the height of her religious zeal, and was at length guilty of the
most atrocious crime against God and womanhood.</p>

<p>Irene, during the reign of her husband Leo, surnamed the Khazar, did not
openly betray her inclination to the image-worship which she had solemnly
forsworn under her father-in-law Constantine. On his death (780) she at
once seized the government in the name of her son Constantine, who was but
ten years old. Her creature, Patriarch Tarasius, summoned a council on
image-worship.</p>

<p>The council met in Constantinople (785), but with the army and a large
part of the populace of Constantinople image-worship had lost its power.
The soldiery, attached to the memory and tenets of Constantine Copronymus,
broke into the assembly, and dispersed the affrighted monks and
bishops.</p>

<h5>SECOND COUNCIL OF NICÆA (787 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[787-842 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Nicæa was chosen for the session of the council, no doubt on account of
the reverence which attached to that city, hallowed by the sittings of the first
great council of Christendom. Decrees issued from Nicæa would possess
peculiar force and authority; this smaller city, too, could be occupied by
troops on whom the empress could depend, and in the meantime Irene managed
to disband the more unruly soldiery. Thus, while the Bulgarians
menaced one frontier and the Saracens another, she sacrificed the safety of
the empire, by the dissolution of her best army, to the success of her religious
designs.</p>

<p>The council met at Nicæa. The number of ecclesiastics is variously
stated from 330 to 387. Among these were at least 130 monks or abbots,
besides many bishops, who had been expelled as monks from their sees, and
were now restored. They repudiated the so-called Council of Constantinople,
as a synod of fools and madmen, who had dared to violate the established
discipline of the church and impiously reviled the holy images. They
showered their anathemas on all the acts, on all the words, on all the persons
engaged in that unhallowed assembly.</p>

<p>The fathers of Nicæa impaired a doubtful cause by the monstrous fables
which they adduced, the preposterous arguments which they used, their unmeasured
invectives against their antagonists. With one voice they broke out
into a long acclamation: “We all believe, we all assent, we all subscribe.
This is the faith of the apostles, this is the faith of the church, this is the
faith of the orthodox, this is the faith of all the world. We, who adore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553"></a>[553]</span>
the Trinity, worship images. Whoever does not the like, anathema upon
him! Anathema on all who call images idols! Anathema on all who communicate
with them who do not worship images!”</p>

<p>Among the acclamations and the anathemas which closed the Second Council
of Nicæa, echoed loud salutations and prayers for the peace and blessedness
of the new Constantine and the new Helena. A few years passed and that
Constantine was blinded, if not put to death, by his unnatural mother, whom
religious faction had raised into a model of Christian virtue and devotion.</p>

<p>The controversy slept during the reign of Nicephorus, and that of Michael,
surnamed Rhangabé. The monks throughout this period seem to form an
independent power (a power no doubt arising out of and maintained by their
championship of image-worship), and to dictate to the emperor, and even to
the church. On the other hand, among the soldiery are heard some deep but
suppressed murmurs of attachment to the memory of Constantine Copronymus.
Leo the Armenian ascended the throne.</p>

<p>As Irene had promoted Tarasius, so Leo raised an officer of his household,
Theodotus Cassiteras, to the patriarchal throne. Image-worship was
again proscribed by an imperial edict. The worshippers are said to have
been ruthlessly persecuted; and Leo, according to the phraseology of the
day, is accused of showing all the blood-thirstiness without the generosity
of the lion. Yet no violent popular tumult took place; nor does the conspiracy
which afterwards cut short the days of Leo the Armenian appear to
have been connected with the strife of religious factions. Whatever hopes
the clergy, at least the image-worshippers, or the monks, might have conceived
at the murder of Leo, which they scrupled not to allege as a sign of
the divine disfavour towards the iconoclasts, were disappointed on the accession
of Michael the Stammerer. He favoured the Jews in the exaction of
tribute (perhaps he was guilty of the sin of treating them with justice), he
fasted on the Jewish Sabbath, he doubted the resurrection of the dead, and
the personality of the devil, as unauthorised by the religion of Moses. Image-worship
he treated with contemptuous impartiality. In a great public
assembly (assembled for the purpose), he proclaimed the worship of images a
matter altogether indifferent.</p>

<p>Theophilus could not but perceive the failure, and disdained to imitate
his father’s temporising policy, who endeavoured to tolerate the monks, while
he discouraged image-worship. He avowed his determination to extirpate
both at once. Leo the Armenian and Michael the Stammerer had attempted
to restrict the honours paid to images; Theophilus prohibited the making of
new ones, and ordered that in every church they should be effaced, and the
walls covered with pictures of birds and beasts. The sacred vessels, adorned
with figures, were profaned by unhallowed hands, sold in the public markets,
and melted for their metal. The prisons were full of painters, of monks and
ecclesiastics of all orders. The monks, driven from their convents, fled to
desert places; some perished of cold and hunger, some threw off the proscribed
dress, yet retained the sacred character and habits; others seized the
opportunity of returning to the pleasures as to the dress of the world.</p>

<p>The history of iconoclasm has a remarkable uniformity: another female
in power, another restoration of images. After the death of Theophilus his
widow Theodora administered the empire in the name of her youthful son
Michael, called afterwards the Drunkard. Theodora, like her own mother
Theoctista, had always worshipped images in private. No sooner was
Theophilus dead than the monks, no doubt in the secret of Theodora’s concealed
attachment to images, poured into Constantinople from all quarters.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554"></a>[554]</span>
She now ventured to send an officer of the palace to command the patriarch,
Joannes the Grammarian, either to recant his iconoclastic opinions, or to withdraw
from Constantinople. The patriarch is accused of a paltry artifice.
He opened a vein in the region of his stomach, and showed himself wounded
and bleeding to the people. The rumour spread that the empress had
attempted to assassinate the patriarch. But the fraud was detected, exposed,
acknowledged. The abashed patriarch withdrew, unpitied and despised,
into the suburbs (842). Methodius was raised to the dignity of the patriarchate.
The worshippers of images were in triumph.</p>

<p>But Theodora, still tenderly attached to the memory of her husband,
demanded, as the price of her inestimable services in the restoration of
images, absolution for the sin of his iconoclasm and his persecution of the
image-worshippers.</p>

<p>All was now easy; the fanaticism of iconoclasm was exhausted or rebuked.
A solemn festival was appointed for the restoration of images.
The whole clergy of Constantinople, and all who could flock in from the
neighbourhood, met in and before the palace of the archbishop, and marched
in procession with crosses, torches, and incense, to the church of St. Sophia.
There they were met by the empress and her infant son Michael, Feb. 19th,
842. They made the circuit of the church, with their burning torches, paying
homage to every image and picture, which had been carefully restored, never
again to be effaced till the days of later, more terrible iconoclasts, the Ottoman
Turks.</p>

<p>The Greek church from that time has celebrated the anniversary of this
festival with loyal fidelity. The successors of Methodius, particularly the
learned Photius, were only zealous to consummate the work of his predecessors,
and images have formed part of the recognised religious worship of the
Eastern world.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1b5"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1b">b</a></span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> [The office to which Gregory I was suddenly elevated in the year 590, included under it the
three following distinct dignities. First, it included the actual episcopal charge of the city of
Rome; the church of St. John Lateran with its haughty inscription: <i>Omnium Urbis et Orbis
Ecclesiarum Mater et Caput</i>&mdash;being the cathedral church; and the adjoining Lateran palace,
which tradition says was given by Constantine to Silvester I, being the place of residence.
Secondly, it included the metropolitan or archiepiscopal superintendence of the Roman territory,
with jurisdiction over the seven suffragan bishops, afterwards called cardinal bishops; the
bishops of Ostia, Portus, Silva Candida, Sabina, Præneste, Tusculum, and Albanum. Thirdly, it
included the patriarchal oversight of the suburban provinces, which were under the political jurisdiction
of the <i>Vicarius Urbis</i>, viz., Campania, Tuscany with Umbria, Picenum, Valeria, Samnium,
Apulia with Calabria, Lucania with Bruttium&mdash;in short, upper Italy, together with the three
islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. As patriarch, the Roman bishop stood on the same
footing as the four great patriarchs of the East, those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,
Jerusalem; he enjoyed however the primacy of honour, and standing alone in the West, whereas
four patriarchs divided the primacy of the East, his jurisdiction often seemed to extend to districts
where he had no jurisdiction by right. For the vicariate of Rome was only one among
four vicariates, into which the great prefecture of Italy was politically divided; the other
vicariates being northern Italy, with its centre at Milan; western Illyricum, with its capital at
Sirmium; and western Africa, with its capital at Carthage. So far were Gaul, Spain, and
Britain from belonging to the vicariate of Rome, that they constituted together a separate
prefecture, known as the prefecture of Gaul. Nevertheless, all these districts were in time drawn
into the patriarchate of Rome, and indeed the whole of western Europe as it gradually came
under the influence of Christianity.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_1e"><a href="#papacy_endnote_1e">e</a></span>]</p>

<h4 id="PAPACY_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II. “THE NIGHT OF THE PAPACY”&mdash;CHARLEMAGNE TO OTTO THE GREAT</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[740-985 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From the East, powerless to render help, from an empire crumbling away
beneath the weight of its own greatness, Gregory III therefore turned away,
and fixed his gaze on the youthful greatness of a transalpine nation&mdash;the
Franks&mdash;brave, adventurous, full of promise, successful in warfare, and
destined to rise to future power. With Charles Martel, mayor of the palace,
and virtual ruler of the Frankish realm, Gregory II had already opened
communications. To Charles Martel, his successor Gregory III again
appealed, when, after eight years of doubtful peace, he suddenly found himself
involved in an open war with the Lombards. His appeal is truly touching:
“His tears are falling night and day for the destitute state of the
church; the Lombard king and his son are ravaging the last remains of
the property of the church, which no longer suffices for the sustenance of the
poor, or to provide lights for the daily service; they have invaded the territory
of Rome and seized all his farms; his only hope is in the timely succour
of the Frankish king.” The appeal was rendered still stronger by the
presents that accompanied it&mdash;the mystic keys of the sepulchre of St. Peter,
and filings of his chains, which no Christian could resist. The title of patrician
and consul of Rome was offered; and Gregory, as might be expected
after such presents, received a courteous answer and an embassy was despatched
to the imperial city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[741-754 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It is impossible to say what might have been the result of the negotiations
between the pope and the ambassadors had they been continued.
They were, however, interrupted by the death of both the potentates; of
Charles Martel in October, of Gregory III in November of the very same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556"></a>[556]</span>
year. Nevertheless these negotiations were the prelude to subsequent negotiations
which Pepin le Bref, the son of Charles Martel, carried on with
Pope Zacharias (Zachary), the successor of Gregory III; and this time the
negotiations led to most important results.</p>

<h5>INDEPENDENCE OF THE ROMAN BISHOPS</h5>

<p>At the election of Zacharias, the customary form of obtaining the consent
of the exarch was discarded, and discarded to be never afterwards revived.
Henceforth the popes may be considered as independent of the Eastern
Empire; henceforth begins their connection with the West; henceforth
they hold no longer an exclusive ecclesiastical position, but the papacy has
become a political dukedom. After the Sixth General Council, they had
claimed the title of “universal priest,” and vindicated that claim by soon
afterwards reducing to submission the last of the great archbishops of the
West. After the appeal to Charles Martel and the independent election of
Zacharias, they aspired to political sovereignty.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2b"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>THE APPEAL TO THE FRANKS</h5>

<p>Zacharias, convinced of the advantage which Rome might derive from
intimate union with the rising power of the Franks, watched with careful
attention over the interests of the mayors of the palace; and it was at his
suggestion that the nation at length conferred on those powerful functionaries
the titles as well as the privileges of royalty. The Lombard princes
regarded him with corresponding reverence. Liutprand, whose reign lasted
above thirty years, was distinguished for his devout observance of the
maxims of the church. The charity of the pontiff was equal to his talents,
and the slaves which Venice offered to the Moors were purchased by
his agents and set free.</p>

<p>Stephen II,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who next occupied the pontifical chair, had to endure, from
the very commencement of his career, the troubles and dangers of domestic
wars. Aistulf, the new king of the Lombards, inherited the spirit of his earliest
predecessors, and it only required the appearance of a leader like Aistulf to
put an end forever to the rule of the Greeks in Italy. But the Lombard
monarch was not contented with the acquisition of Ravenna. He assailed
the duchy of Rome and the lands of the church, nor could Stephen, either
by the most solemn expostulations, or the offers which he made of money,
induce the conqueror to withdraw his troops. In this situation, and when
the Lombards had demanded as the price of their safety a tribute which the
citizens of Rome felt it would be impossible to pay, the pontiff sent messengers
to Constantinople requesting aid of the emperor; but his entreaties were
disregarded. He turned his eyes towards France, where Pepin, the father of
the heroic Charlemagne, was now at the head of a nation as warlike as the
Lombards, and as disposed to ally itself with Rome as the invaders were to
effect its ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557"></a>[557]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[754-755 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Ambassadors were sent to Rome to treat with the Lombards for Stephen’s
safe passage into France, a negotiation which could scarcely fail in the hands
of the powerful sovereign by whom it was undertaken. The pontiff was
speedily on his way to the new protector of the church. He appeared with
all his attendants before the monarch, clad in sackcloth and ashes, and falling
at his knees he implored him, by the mercy of God and the merits of St.
Peter and St. Paul, to deliver Rome from the devastation of the Lombards.
Pepin in reply promised to grant the pontiff’s request, and speedily fulfilled
his promise by compelling the enemy to retreat and shut himself up in the
single town of Pavia. Aistulf, thus pressed, agreed to the terms proposed
by his conqueror, and the French army was withdrawn. But scarcely had
they left the district when he returned to the attack with renewed vigour,
laid waste the country round Rome with fire and sword, and at length
encamped before the gates of the city itself. The pontiff again sent a strong
appeal to his protector. He dictated his letter in the name of the apostle
Peter, closely imitating his epistles, and speaking in a language which implied
that he was possessed of an authority to anoint or dethrone kings, and to
perform the offices, not of a messenger, of a teacher sent from God, which
is the highest characteristic of an apostle, but of a delegated minister of his
power and justice.</p>

<p>The French monarch was moved to render the pontiff immediate succour,
and Aistulf was quickly deprived of the fruits of his numerous campaigns.
It now became a question to whom the district from which the Lombard was
driven ought of right to belong; and, before this point could be decided, the
envoy of the Greek emperor appeared, to claim for his master the restoration of
the territory which he had so completely abandoned to its fate. But Pepin was
both too politic and too conscious of his power to listen to such demands;
and sending his chief counsellor, the abbot Fulrade (Folrad), to perform the
investiture, he granted to Stephen, and to his successors forever, the undivided
sovereignty of the conquered territory.</p>

<p>Thus commenced the temporal dominion of the bishops of Rome&mdash;an
event which marks a distinct period in the history of the papacy, but the
importance of which we cannot but think has been somewhat overrated.
The power by which the pontiffs acquired their vast empire in the minds of
men, owed little or none of its vigour to the influence they possessed as
princes; it went on increasing till it reached the very boundaries of civilisation,
while their little seigniory remained confined within the narrowest
limits; and it declined, and became almost nominal, while their rights as
sovereigns continued to be acknowledged by all the states of Europe. In
point of wealth it plainly admits of being questioned whether they could
gain any advantage from an acquisition which obliged them to keep an army
in their pay; to support a countless train of emissaries and envoys; and to
engage in all the expensive arts of diplomacy with the monarchs of countries
whose treasures were perpetually supplied by the labours and the commerce
of their people.</p>

<p>As little was their new dominion advantageous to their dignity. The
pontiff was the first among the spiritual rulers of mankind, the lowest
almost of temporal princes. As the head of the church, he was rendered
venerable by all the associations and by many of the highest sanctions of
religion; as the successor of the exarchs of Ravenna, he was the dependent
of every prince who had an army at his command, and was but an item in
the catalogue of petty rulers, who were counted as make-weights in the
balance of power. In whatever designs he undertook as the supremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558"></a>[558]</span>
endowed minister of God, he could appeal to the hearts and consciences of
men; could shake the confidence of the mightiest, and bring into alliance the
most contrary elements of society to effect his purpose; whatever attempts
he had to make in his temporal capacity required to be supported by the
pettiest inventions of secret policy, by contrivances and deceits which, in
time, rendered the proceedings of the court of Rome proverbial as examples
of cunning and duplicity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[755-775 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Stephen died, after a short but eventful pontificate of five years, and was
succeeded by his brother Paul (756 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>). The Greeks still continued to
proclaim their pretensions to the sovereignty of Italy; nor dared the Roman
pontiff, vain as were their claims, at once throw off the appearance of allegiance.
The Lombards, on the other hand, showed themselves little inclined
to preserve the treaty which had been formed with the church. A tumult,
equally dangerous to the state and to the respectability of the pontificate,
followed the death of Paul. Totona, a nobleman of wealth and influence,
formed the design of elevating his brother Constantine to the vacant chair,
and Constantine kept possession of his usurped authority nearly a year.
A strong effort was then made by the great body of the clergy and the people
to recover their invaded right of election. The pontiff was seized, and
deprived of his eyes. A new pope ascended the throne.</p>

<p>Stephen III enjoyed his honours about four years, and then left them to
be possessed by Adrian I. The Lombards still pressed close upon the boundaries
of Rome. It was at this period, moreover, that the controversy with
the iconoclasts approached its highest degree of virulence; and Adrian had
to employ all the prudence of which he was master to meet the dangers in
which it involved him. The measures pursued by the empress Irene were
as unfavourable to his views as they were in themselves violent and unjust.
The iconoclasts were as odious to him as to her; they were as opposed to
the system which it was his object to establish, as they were to her usurpations
and tyranny. While he expressed his doubts, therefore, as to the propriety
of the new patriarch’s consecration, and showed considerable backwardness
in recognising the Second Council of Nicæa, he attempted no vigorous resistance
to the invasion of those rules which were violated in her proceedings.
The establishment of image-worship promised effects more favourable to
his general interests than the assumption of authority by Tiresias, and his
patroness was offensive to his immediate feelings. But the church was now
to receive the support of a prince whose character and circumstances were
equally calculated to mark him for her champion.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2c1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>CHARLEMAGNE AND THE POPE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[775-776 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Einhard<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2l"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2l">l</a></span> (Eginhard), the biographer of Charlemagne, informs us that the
strictest friendship subsisted between that monarch and Pope Adrian I. In
the still extant correspondence between them, we find the freest communication
of opinion and feeling both upon political and ecclesiastical affairs. In
exact conformity with the policy of his predecessors, Adrian regarded the
Frankish monarch as the covenanted protector of the holy see and its possessions,
and in that capacity bound to recover for her every debt the pope
might see fit to claim as her “righteous due.” Thus when Leo, archbishop
of Ravenna, refused to relinquish his metropolitan rights over certain districts
alleged to form part of the donation of Charlemagne, the pope expressed
his anxiety for the presence and support of his friend and protector. Adrian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559"></a>[559]</span>
moreover, suspected the royal <i>missi</i>, or commissioners, of collusion with the
vassal dukes of Benevento and Spoleto, to the injury of the holy see; and,
whether from authentic information or with a view to alarm his correspondent
for the safety of his Italian conquests, he magnified the transactions
complained of into a criminal conspiracy against the crown. He told the
king that the outbreak was actually fixed to take place in the month of March
then next following (776 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>); that Adelchis (Adalgis), the son of Desiderius,
the captive king of the Lombards, was to appear on the coast with a
Greek fleet; that Rome was to be assailed both by sea and land, the churches
were to be plundered, the pope was to be carried into captivity, and the
Lombard dynasty to be reinstated.</p>

<p>Other motives were not wanting to induce Charlemagne to pay a second
military visit to his newly acquired dominions in Italy. It had become necessary
to take immediate steps for the dissolution of a long-suspected plot
between his disaffected subject, Duke Tassilo of Bavaria, and the partisans
of the late dynasty. In the winter, therefore, of the year 776, he crossed the
Alps at the head of a numerous army; the duke of Friuli, who appears to
have taken a principal part in the conspiracy, was expelled from his duchy;
and in a short time the presence of the conqueror appears to have dispelled
all apprehensions of further danger either to church or state. The pope
professed himself satisfied with the result, and returned thanks for the protection
afforded with great apparent warmth and cordiality.</p>

<h5>THE DONATION FROM CONSTANTINE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[776-780 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Yet all had not, it seems, been done for the satisfaction of the papal
claims. Another and a different title to an almost imperial power is brought
to light. Now, for the first time after the lapse of four centuries and a half,
it is discovered that all which Pepin or Charlemagne had conferred on the
church of Rome was an insignificant instalment of that more extensive
dominion originally granted to the chair of Peter by “the pious emperor
Constantine.”</p>

<p>The expressions used by the pope to denote the extent of this supposed
donation are not free from uncertainty and ambiguity. The endowment of
“supreme power over all the region of the West,” alleged to have been
granted by Constantine the Great, must have comprehended much more than
the territories conveyed by the deeds of Pepin and Charlemagne. It is
therefore insinuated that, though those princes had dealt liberally by the
church, they would, notwithstanding, not have done their whole duty until
they should have given possession of all that had been comprised in the original
deed of gift. Charlemagne, it seems, was to consider himself as the
mere executor of his predecessor Constantine the Great; and in that character
it is obvious he must stand in a position of far less observance than as
the spontaneous patron and benefactor.</p>

<p>The fictitious donation was presented to him as absolute in its terms;
therefore as at once discharging the estate conveyed in the execution of its
provisions from all dues, duties, and conditions whatsoever, claimable by the
hand through which it passed to the rightful owner. It was significantly
hinted that his past services were held by the pope to merge in his obligations
for the future; that he should think less of the benefits he had conferred
than of the duties he might rightfully be called upon to perform; and
that, as long as a single item of the infinite debt entailed upon him by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560"></a>[560]</span>
great testator remained unpaid, he must consider himself as debtor to God
and St. Peter for the whole.</p>

<p>It would be hardly fair to presume that the impudent forgery, afterwards
known by the title of the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>, had as yet found its appropriate
niche in the archives of the Lateran, or that it was included among the
documents which the pope instructed his envoys to produce to Charlemagne.
But among the multitude of eager searchers, the thing wanted is generally
near enough at hand for the purposes of the less scrupulous among the number.
In the reign of Pope Adrian I the desire for territorial acquisition had
been stimulated by success to a degree of intensity scarcely paralleled in the
history of secular ambition. In such a disposition, a feather-light tradition
might stand as good ground for the most extravagant claims; and the fabrication
of the outward proof of what was already registered in men’s minds as
accredited fact, might appear as a mere venial condescension to the natural
adhesion of mankind to the usual and customary modes of proof.</p>

</div>

<p>The transient visit of Charlemagne to Italy in the year 776 appears for
the moment to have dissipated the apprehensions of the pope. Four years
later an interval of peace on his Saxon frontier and the temporary submission
of his turbulent vassal Tassilo of Bavaria left Charlemagne at leisure to disentangle
by his presence the ravelled state of Italian affairs. He was probably
anxious to acquaint himself personally with the causes of the existing
disorders, as well as to obtain an explanation of the interruption in the harmony
of his correspondence with the pope, whom he sincerely honoured and
was well disposed to support. The critical state, however, of the coasts
and frontiers, as depicted to him by Adrian, appears to have made no serious
impression. No military preparations were thought necessary; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561"></a>[561]</span>
winter of the year 780, Charlemagne, accompanied by his consort Hildegard,
his two infant sons Carloman and Louis, and escorted by no other force than
his ordinary household troops and followers, crossed the Alps into Italy.
The annalists of the age describe the expedition as a visit of devotion.</p>

<h5>CHARLEMAGNE’S THIRD AND FOURTH ENTRANCES INTO ITALY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[780-786 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the spring of the year 781 Charlemagne arrived for the third time in
Rome, where he celebrated the great festival of Easter. Pope Adrian upon
this occasion conferred the right of baptism on the two young princes, changing
the name of the elder from that of Carloman to Pepin, in honour of
his grandfather; and at the same moment he crowned the elder “king of the
Lombards,” and the younger (Louis) king of Aquitaine. The honour was
accepted, probably solicited, by the king without any misgiving as to the
inferences that might thereafter be drawn from this or past condescendencies
of the like character. Charlemagne never scrupled to make use of church
or pontiff for the accomplishment of his political purposes; and he now called
upon Adrian to support the remonstrances he thought it necessary to address
to his nephew Tassilo by the aid of his spiritual authority.</p>

<p>Charlemagne could not but acknowledge that he had been greatly indebted
to the exertions of the churchmen for the pacification of his Saxon
acquisitions; and in requital of this co-operation he was not inclined to
deny to his spiritual allies an important share in the profits of victory. But
the consciousness of present power shut out any sinister view to the future.
The church was, after all, in his hands no more than an instrument for the
accomplishment of his purposes; that she should ever become his mistress
was remote from his contemplation; and it is not to be wondered at that
he should have identified her interests with those of his government in
that spirit of gratitude which might in the sequel be made to wear an aspect
of homage very conducive to the progress of hierarchical pretension.</p>

<p>Both parties were in the main inclined to regard each other as the means
and instruments for the promotion of their separate interests. But the
absence of any real reciprocity in the terms of compact could not but very
soon become apparent. No temporal benefit could be conferred by the pope
commensurate with the sacrifices the monarch was incessantly called upon
to make to the insatiate craving of the holy see for those substantial augmentations,
that costly support, that burdensome protection, to which he was held
to have pledged himself. Such an understanding could last no longer than
while either or both parties were actuated rather by religious than by merely
selfish motives. The views of Pope Adrian had nothing of a properly religious
character in them; his correspondence is but an echo of the one shrill
cry for “more.” “Give, grant, endow, restore, and the blessed Peter shall
surely send you victory and prosperity.” This is the burden of the papal
addresses from the birth to the consummation of the alliance. A certain
coincidence of interests, supported upon the religious and loyal character
of Charlemagne, had hitherto cemented the union; but, though the result
might be overlooked, it is clear that as soon as those interests should diverge
or cease to exist, there remained nothing behind to prevent them from falling
into irreconcilable opposition. Even within this period of apparent concord
and cordiality some symptoms of such a divergency may be detected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[786-795 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the year 786 Charlemagne paid a fourth visit to Rome; and after performing
the customary devotional exercises at the principal shrines and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562"></a>[562]</span>
churches, he applied himself to the task of reducing the refractory duke of
Benevento to obedience. An accommodation was easily accomplished;
Charlemagne accepted the renewed oaths of allegiance of the duke and his
vassals, and carried away with him Grimwald (Grimoald), the second son
of Arichis (Arighis), as a pledge for the future obedience of the duke and his
subjects. No notice was taken of the papal claim upon the territory of
Benevento; and Pope Adrian once more saw his royal patron depart without
obtaining the object nearest to his heart. During the remainder of his pontificate
we trace no further attempt on the part of the pope to realise his
favourite project of aggrandisement. The momentary coolness which had
followed the defeat of the Calabrian Greeks produced no real estrangement
between him and his great patron; and Adrian died (795) in the full
enjoyment of the confidence and esteem of Charlemagne.</p>

<h5>THE REALM OF THE POPES</h5>

<p>At the close of the reign of Charlemagne the possessions of the church
of Rome may thus be identified with existing geographical divisions: (1) In
virtue of right, or pretension of right, originating prior to the donation of
Pepin, the pontiffs exercised temporal jurisdiction over the city and duchy
of Rome as it had existed under the Byzantine supremacy, comprehending,
as nearly as may now be ascertained, the modern district emphatically known
by the name of the “Patrimony Proper,” together with the greatest portion if
not the whole of the Campagna di Roma as far south as Terracina. (2) By
the donations of Pepin and Charlemagne the church of Rome had reduced into
possession the city and exarchate of Ravenna, comprising the modern legations
of Bologna, Romagna, Urbino, and Ferrara, with the duchies of Parma and
Modena and a portion of the Venetian terra-firma on the mouths of the Po.</p>

<p>But these extensive tracts of country were regarded by the popes as but
a portion of their claim under the treaties of Pontyon and Quierzy and the
donation of Charlemagne. That claim extended over the islands of Corsica
and Sardinia, the entire duchies of Benevento and Spoleto, and all the remaining
dependencies of the Byzantines in southern Italy, including both Calabrias
and the adjacent island of Sicily; thus constituting in the aggregate nearly
the whole of Italy south of the river Po, ranging thence along the eastern
declivity of the Apennines as far as the southernmost confine of the modern
grand duchy of Tuscany, and thence expanding over the breadth of the peninsula
to the extreme coasts, embracing all the greater adjoining islands and
the territory of Istria on the northeastern shores of the Adriatic Sea. Pope
Adrian I died on the 26th of December in the year 795, after the unusually
long pontificate of twenty-three years and upwards. When Charlemagne
heard of his demise, we are told that he wept for him as for a brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[795-800 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>On the occasion of Charlemagne’s first visit to Rome (774), Pope Adrian
conferred upon him the title and dignity of patrician, or official advocate and
protector of the holy see. When shortly after the death of that pontiff in
the year 795, Leo, archpriest of the church of St. Susanna, was elected to the
vacant chair by the title of Leo III, the new pope hastened to renew the patent
of the patriciate, as if it were an office expiring with the life of the grantor.
As matters stood at this moment between him and the king, it is safest to
conclude that the pope desired that the royal patrician should regard himself
as captain-general of the church, and that he should in that capacity be
entitled to the military services of its subjects, when called on by the church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563"></a>[563]</span>
to interfere for the protection of her temporal rights. But the act of Pope
Leo III, which placed his subjects under military obligation to a stranger, was
calculated to engender grave misunderstandings. The feudal principle, now
rapidly unfolding itself in the European polity, drew no distinction between
civil and military subjection; and the oath of the Romans to the protector
might be easily confounded with that of subject to sovereign.</p>

<p>The constitutional or political powers exercised at this period by the
pontiffs within the city and territory of the church are very obscurely indicated
in the documents of the age. From what we discern on the surface
of history, no very well-defined relation subsisted between the so-called
“republic of Rome” and the spiritual ruler. The bond which connected
them, as far as, at this distance of time and with such defective information,
we can discern, was the recognised participation of the richer and more
powerful families in all the offices of government and the dignities and
emoluments of ecclesiastical promotion. But by such an arrangement it is
obvious that every just limit between spiritual and temporal interests must
be speedily obliterated; the result was verified in the unutterable corruptions
of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Even at this point of time, and
for a long series of years past, many symptoms of a vicious and demoralising
relation between the constituents of the Roman state are apparent.</p>

<p>In the fifth year of the pontificate of Leo III two relatives of Pope
Adrian I, Paschal the primicerius and Campulus the sacellarius of the holy
see, conspired to depose the reigning pontiff. After suffering some personal
injuries at the hands of his rebellious subjects, Leo was expelled from
the city; and he resolved to solicit redress in person at the court of Charlemagne,
who was at that moment sojourning at Paderborn, within the confines
of the vanquished Saxons. The king received the suppliant pontiff
with the highest honours, and listened to his complaints with the profoundest
attention. Of the special subjects of the conference we are not informed;
but in the autumn of the year 799 Leo returned to Rome under an escort
sufficiently strong to insure his personal safety. In the interim, the faction
opposed to him had lost ground, and he was received by the citizens with
unusual tokens of joy and affection.</p>

<p>Pope Leo was, as it appears, accompanied to Rome by two German
prelates, Hildebrand archbishop of Cologne, and Arno archbishop of Salzburg,
as <i>missi dominici</i>, or royal commissioners, charged to make due inquisition
into the offences imputed to the pope by his adversaries. The
prelates are said to have examined the evidence on both sides with great
care and minuteness, and at the close of it to have come to the conclusion
that nothing criminal had been established against the pope; upon which
decision his rebellious accusers were taken into custody and carried away to
France.</p>

<h5>THE TRIAL OF THE POPE AND THE CROWNING OF CHARLEMAGNE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[800 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Within the twelvemonth of the reinstatement of the pope, Charlemagne
held a great diet of the realm at Mainz. “There,” says the annalist,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2m1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2m">m</a></span> “he
assembled his great nobles, his bishops, and his abbots all; and having
reported to them that there was now peace in all his borders, he called to
their minds the evils which the Romans had done to the apostolic Leo; and
he set his face to go into the parts of Rome, and thither he accordingly
proceeded.” This simple notice of the annalist of Moissac is the only passage
in any original chronicle in which a motive for this fifth expedition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564"></a>[564]</span>
Charlemagne to Rome is assigned. The king arrived at the gates of the
city on the 24th of November, 800, and was received by the pontiff under
the porch of St. Peter’s church, outside the walls, with all due devotion and
honour. Seven days afterwards a solemn assembly of the citizens was
convoked, at which the king acquainted them with the cause of his visit.</p>

<p>His next proceeding is not very intelligible. He assembled, we are told,
a solemn synod, still in the basilica of St. Peter, to inquire into the crimes
imputed to the pope; but whether the old or fresh inculpations is not said.
On this occasion the king and the pope sat beside each other, surrounded
by the nobility, the bishops, and the abbots of France and Italy. The
spiritual lords alone were seated; the inferior priests and the laity of all
ranks remained standing. Proclamation was then made for the accusers
to come forward and make their complaint; but no one answered to the
call. It is not apparent why this formality should have been observed at
all, inasmuch as the clergy had unanimously declared themselves incompetent
to sit in judgment upon a pontiff of the holy see. The pope, however,
intimated his intention to purge himself of all the offences laid to his charge
in the form established in like cases by his predecessors. On the following
day, therefore, he in full synod took the books of the Gospels in his hands,
and upon them he solemnly protested his innocence; whereupon “the prelates
and all the clergy burst simultaneously into a hymn of thanksgiving,
devoutly praising God, the holy Virgin, St. Peter, and all the saints.”</p>

<p>Within the first month of the residence of Charlemagne in Rome nothing
took place indicative of any ulterior purpose. During all that time the king
had appeared to be absorbed in regulating the political affairs of the church
and city. But on Christmas Day of the year 800, while he and the pope
devoutly knelt together at the altar of St. Peter’s church, engaged in the
preliminary prayer before mass, the pontiff, as if moved by a sudden impulse
of inspiration, placed upon his head an elaborately wrought and very costly
imperial crown. At the same time the people, as if prepared for the incident,
simultaneously and as with one voice exclaimed, “Long life to Charles,
augustus, the great and peace-giving emperor of the Romans, whom the hand
of God hath crowned!” The salutation was twice repeated; after which,
according to imperial custom, he was enthroned and anointed with holy oil,
and worshipped by the pope. “Whereby,” says the annalist,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2m2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2m">m</a></span> “he was unanimously
constituted emperor; and dropping the title of patrician, he was
thenceforth called ‘imperator augustus.’”</p>

<p>Whether the crown was placed on his head with or without his consent,
the mode of conferring it was intended to imply that the king was a passive
party, that he accepted it as a boon or gift at the hands of the pope without
claim or pretence of right on his own part. The material crown itself was
of papal procurement and fabrication; the act of coronation was that of the
pontiff; he gave the crown, the Roman people ratified the act and proclaimed
the emperor. The transaction bears the character of a joint act, in which Leo
and the Romans performed the part of spontaneous electors and sovereign
depositaries of imperial power. The adoration was a simple ceremony of
recognition; it was unaccompanied with any new oath of allegiance; the
rights of the new emperor still resting upon the oath of obedience to him
as patrician. Ultimately the participation of the people was no doubt considered
as wholly accessory to the papal decision; and the pope might well
hold himself out to the world as the sole depositary and dispenser of imperial
authority. Upon this ground, indeed, the papacy cast anchor, and for all
future ages held on with amazing pertinacity and success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565"></a>[565]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[800-824 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>On the other hand, Charlemagne and his subjects did not concern themselves
with any curious inquiry into the origin of the powers which the
imperial crown brought along with it. Yet, in conformity with their general
notion of government, they believed that Rome and her pontiff had taken
upon them the relation of subjects to the emperor whom they had crowned
and anointed. It is certain that Charlemagne regarded himself as the
sovereign of Rome, if not of the pope; he was emperor in his own right as
fully as if he had placed the crown upon his own head. In conformity with
the opinion and practice of his age, he grounded that right upon possession.
In the mind of the warrior there was no place for any other derivation of
title; and Charlemagne and his successors took as little distinction between
the possession and the sovereignty of Rome and its appurtenant territories
as they did in the case of his newly acquired dominions in Germany, Lombardy,
or Spain.</p>

<p>A few days after the coronation of Charlemagne, he directed the persons
implicated in the plot of the preceding year against the life and government
of the pope to be brought before him for judgment; and, as supreme judge,
he condemned them to the death of traitors. This exercise of supreme
criminal judicature indicates at least the assumption of a power understood
in that age to be a distinguishing attribute of sovereign authority. The
condemned criminals were indeed respited at the intercession of the pope,
and their punishment was commuted for exile; but nothing occurred to
indicate any jealous feeling on the part of the pontiff; and throughout the
winter of the year 801 Charlemagne continued to exercise every prerogative
of imperial power in Rome with as free a hand as when he set up his migratory
throne upon the banks of the Seine, the Rhine, or the Elbe.</p>

<p>In the year 806 he executed a provisional settlement of the succession to
his vast dominions among his then surviving sons. During the whole course
of his life Charlemagne was anxious to invest his more important acts with
the sanction of religion. The settlement of 806, though provisional only,
was solemnly enacted and sworn to by his sons and the estates of the realm
assembled in diet at Thionville; and was soon afterwards sent by the hand
of the emperor’s secretary to Rome for the approval and signature of the
pope&mdash;a step which lay open to a construction probably far beyond the intent
of Charlemagne.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2d"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2d">d</a></span></p>

<h5>PAPAL AMBITION AFTER CHARLEMAGNE</h5>

<p>Almost immediately after Charlemagne’s death, Leo assumed to himself
a degree of authority which could not be exercised without equal injury to
the state and to the sacerdotal character. Stephen IV, his successor, took the
oath of allegiance, together with the whole of the people, as soon as he
ascended the pontifical throne; and announced to the monarch, Louis the
Pious, that he would attend him at whatever place he should appoint. But
the Christian meekness of the pontiff was exceeded by that of the sovereign,
who, on receiving his visit at Rheims, prostrated himself three times
at his feet. There is evidence, however, to prove that it still required a man
of equally powerful and ambitious mind to take full advantage of the means
of aggrandisement afforded by the present position of the church. During
the short reigns of several successive popes, we see the power of the emperor
distinctly at work, and his right acknowledged, in the management of ecclesiastical
affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566"></a>[566]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[824-847 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the year 824, and under the pontificate of Eugenius I, Louis sent his
son Lothair to Rome, to inquire into the truth of the complaints made by
the citizens against their sacerdotal chiefs; and when Gregory IV visited
France, for the purpose of
effecting a reconciliation
between Louis and his son,
the bishops of France, whom
he appears to have threatened
with his censures,
proudly dared him to a trial
of his power, by informing
him that if he did aught
against the canons, he should
himself be excommunicated
or deposed. The pernicious
counsel of one of his advisers
taught him to answer this
intimation by fresh assertions
of authority, and he
dared to commence the practice,
which subsequently
proved such a fruitful
source of disorder and
scandal in Christendom, of
declaring the sovereign deposed
because of his quarrel
with the ruler of the Roman
church. The emperor
Lothair was sufficiently
tenacious of his authority to
issue especial orders, on the
election of Sergius II without
his being consulted, that
for the future no candidate
for the papal throne should
be consecrated till he had
given his assent to the
election.</p>

<p>In the midst of these
events, the victorious Saracens
were pursuing their
conquests over the most
fertile provinces of Europe,
Asia, and Africa. While
Calabria was overrun by
one division of the Saracens,
Rome itself was threatened
by another. In vain did
the terrified Romans look
to the descendants of Charlemagne
for help; in vain did they proffer again their broken allegiance to
the emperor of the East. Neither the one nor the other was in a condition
to render the required assistance, and the city appeared doomed to destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567"></a>[567]</span>
The venerable churches of St. Peter and St. Paul, which inspired a feeling
of devotion by their antiquity, and of wonder by the magnificence of their
shrines, were situated a short distance from the walls; and the unfortunate
citizens witnessed from the ramparts the spoliation of these, the most sacred
of their temples, without the means of making a single effort for their defence.
But the rage produced by this spectacle, combined with the terror
with which the entrance of the enemy into the city was contemplated, roused
them to attempt some measure of resistance. The death of Sergius just at
this juncture greatly contributed to promote their success. In electing Leo
IV to the vacant office, they provided themselves with a skilful counsellor
and an energetic leader. The invader, after various assaults, was obliged to
retreat, in order to make the conquest of places less skilfully defended.</p>

<p>The death of Leo was succeeded by much confusion, and in this period
of excitement and difficulty, the vacant chair was said to have been ascended
by a woman, the celebrated papess Joan.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2c2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>THE MYTH OF THE WOMAN POPE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[847-855 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Joan was the name given to a female pope, now regarded as a fictitious
personage, who under the title of John VII or VIII was said, according to
the most general accounts, to have occupied the papal chair between the
pontificate of Leo IV and Benedict III, although various other dates are
given. Tradition represents her as of English descent, but born in Ingelheim
or Mainz. By some her original name is given as Gilberta, by others
as Agnes. She was credited with having fallen in love with a young
Benedictine monk, and with having on that account assumed the male
monastic habit and lived for some time in the monastery of Fulda. Her
lover, it is affirmed, died while they were pursuing their studies together at
Athens, and after his death she went to Rome, where, according to the most
approved version of the story, she became a very successful professor. So
high indeed became her reputation for piety and learning that the cardinals
with one consent elected the supposed young monk the successor of Pope
Leo IV. In this position she comported herself so as to entirely justify
their choice, until the catastrophe of giving birth to a male child during a
procession to the Lateran palace suddenly and irrevocably blasted her reputation.
She is said to have died in childbirth or to have been stoned to
death.</p>

<p>The story of the pontificate of Joan was received as fact from the thirteenth
to the fifteenth century, but it has been discredited by later researches.
The circumstantial evidence around which it clung, and which may have
aided in suggesting it, was the observance of a circuit by the papal processions
so as to avoid passing through a certain street (a statue at one time
standing in that street, said to represent a woman and child, with a monumental
stone near it having a peculiar inscription), and the use of a pierced
seat at the enthronement of the popes. Of these facts other and more credible
explanations have, however, been given, although there is no sufficient
evidence to demonstrate beyond dispute the manner in which the story
originated. According to Dr. Döllinger,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2e"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2e">e</a></span> the tradition finds no support
in the original text either of Marianus Scotus,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2n"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2n">n</a></span> Sigebert of Gemblours,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2o"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2o">o</a></span> or
Otto of Freysing.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2p"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2p">p</a></span> She is first mentioned by Stephen de Bourbon,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2q"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2q">q</a></span> who died
in 1261, and who took his information probably from the chronicle of the
Dominican Jean de Mailly, no copy of which is now known to be in existence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568"></a>[568]</span>
The story is not found in any of the original manuscripts of Martinus Polus,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2r"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2r">r</a></span>
and according to Döllinger was interpolated in that chronicle some time
between 1278 and 1312. He attributes the propagation of the myth chiefly
to its insertion in Martinus Polus, from which it was copied into the <i>Flores
Temporum</i>, a chronicle founded on Martinus, and its real originators he
supposes to have been the Dominicans and Minorites, who had a grudge
against the papacy on account of the persecutions they were experiencing
at the hands of Benedict VIII. So rapidly did the tradition spread that in
1400 a bust of the papess was placed in the cathedral of Siena along with
other popes, having the inscription, “John VIII, a woman from England.”
The statue occupied this position till the beginning of the seventeenth
century.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2f"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2f">f</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[847-867 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The eight years of Leo’s papacy were chiefly occupied in strengthening,
in restoring the plundered and desecrated churches of the two apostles, and
adorning Rome. The succession to Leo IV was contested between Benedict
III, who commanded the suffrages of the clergy and people, and Anastasius,
who, at the head of an armed faction, seized the Lateran, stripped
Benedict of his pontifical robes, and awaited the confirmation of his violent
usurpation by the imperial legates, whose influence he thought that he had
secured. But these commissioners, after strict investigation, decided in
favour of Benedict. Anastasius was expelled with disgrace from the Lateran,
his rival consecrated in the presence of the emperor’s representatives.
Anastasius, with unwonted mercy, was only degraded to lay communion.
The pontificate of Benedict III is memorable chiefly for the commencement
of the long strife between Ignatius and Photius for the see of Constantinople.
This strife ended in the permanent schism between the Eastern and Western
churches.</p>

<p>Nicholas I, the successor of Benedict, was chosen rather by the favour
of the emperor Louis and his nobles than that of the clergy (858). He has
been thought worthy to share the appellation of the Great with Leo I, with
Gregory I, with Hildebrand, and with Innocent III. At least three great
events signalised the pontificate of Nicholas I&mdash;the strife of Photius with
Ignatius for the archiepiscopal throne of Constantinople; the prohibition of
the divorce of King Lothair from his queen Theutberga; and the humiliation
of the great prelates on the Rhine, the successful assertion of the papal
supremacy even over Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims. In the first two of
these momentous questions, the contest about the see of Constantinople, and
that of Lothair, king of Lorraine, with his wife Theutberga, Nicholas took
his stand on the great eternal principles of justice, humanity, and sound
morals. These were no questions of abstruse and subtle theology nor the assertion
of dubious rights. In both cases the pope was the protector of the
feeble and the oppressed, the victims of calumny and of cruelty. The bishop
of Constantinople, unjustly deposed, persecuted, exiled, treated with the
worst inhumanity, implored the judgment of the head of western Christendom.
A queen, not only deserted by a weak and cruel husband, but wickedly
and falsely criminated by a council of bishops, obtained a hearing at the
court of Rome; her innocence was vindicated, her accusers punished, the king
himself compelled to bow before the majesty of justice, made more venerable
by religion. If in both cases the language of Nicholas was haughty and
imperious, it was justified to the ears of men by the goodness of his cause.
The lofty supremacy which he asserted over the see of Byzantium awoke no
jealousy, being exerted in behalf of a blameless and injured prelate. If he
treated the royal dignity of France with contempt, it had already become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569"></a>[569]</span>
contemptible in the eyes of mankind; if he annulled by his own authority
the decree of a national council, composed of the most distinguished prelates
of Gaul, that council had already been condemned by all who had
natural sympathies with justice and with innocence. Yet, though in both
cases Nicholas displayed equal ability and resolution in the cause of right,
the event of the two affairs was very different. The dispute concerning the
patriarchate of Constantinople ended in the estrangement, the alienation,
the final schism between the East and West. It was the last time that the
pope was permitted authoritatively to interfere in the ecclesiastical affairs of
the East. The excommunication of the Greek by the Latin church was the
final act of separation. In the West Nicholas established a precedent for control
even over the private morals of princes. The vices of kings, especially
those of France, became the stronghold of papal influence; injured queens
and subjects knew to what quarter they might recur for justice or for revenge.
And on this occasion the pope brought not only the impotent king,
but the powerful clergy of Lorraine, beneath his feet. The great bishops of
Cologne and of Trèves were reduced to abject humiliation.</p>

<h5>RIVALRY OF NICHOLAS AND PHOTIUS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[860-867 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The contention for the patriarchate of Constantinople was, strictly speaking,
no religious controversy&mdash;it was the result of political intrigue and
personal animosity. Ignatius, who became the patriarch, was of imperial
descent. In the revolution which dethroned his father, Michael Rhangabé,
he had taken refuge, under the cowl of a monk, from the jealousy of Leo the
Armenian. Photius was chosen as his successor. Rival councils met, and
the two patriarchs were alternately excommunicated by the adverse spiritual
factions.</p>

<p>Photius was the first to determine on an appeal to Rome. The pope, he
thought, would hardly resist the acknowledgment of his superiority, with the
tempting promise of the total extirpation of the hated iconoclasts. Not
merely did the pope address two lofty and condemnatory letters to the emperor
and to Photius, but a third also to “the faithful in the East,” at the close of
which he made known to the three Eastern patriarchs his steadfast resolution
to maintain the cause of Ignatius, to refuse the recognition of the usurper
Photius. The restoration of Ignatius was commanded even in more imperious
language, and under more awful sanctions. “We, by the power committed
to us by our Lord through St. Peter, restore our brother Ignatius to
his former station, to his see, to his dignity as patriarch, and to all the honours
of his office. Whoever, after the promulgation of this decree, shall presume
to disturb him in the exercise of his office, separate from his communion, or
dare to judge him anew, without the consent of the apostolic see, if a clerk,
shall share the eternal punishment of the traitor Judas; if a layman, he has
incurred the malediction of Canaan; he is excommunicate, and will suffer
the same fearful sentence from the eternal Judge.”</p>

<p>Never had the power of the clergy or the supremacy of Rome been
asserted so distinctly, so inflexibly. The privileges of Rome were eternal,
immutable, anterior to, derived from no synod or council, but granted
directly by God himself; they might be assailed, but not transferred; torn
off for a time, but not plucked up by the roots. An appeal was open to
Rome from all the world, from her authority lay no appeal. The emperor
and Constantinople paid no regard to these terrible anathemas of the pope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570"></a>[570]</span></p>

<h5>SYNOD AT CONSTANTINOPLE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[867 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the year 867 Photius had summoned a council at Constantinople; the
obsequious prelates listened to the arraignment, and joined in the counter
excommunication of Pope Nicholas. Photius drew up eight articles inculpating
in one the faith, in the rest the departure, of the see of Rome from ancient
and canonical discipline. Among the dreadful acts of heresy and schism which
were to divide forever the churches of the East and West were: (1) the
observance of Saturday as a fast; (2) the permission to eat milk or cheese
during Lent; (4) the restriction of the chrism to the bishops; (6) the promotion
of deacons at once to the episcopal dignity; (7) the consecration of a
lamb, according to the hated Jewish usage; (8) the shaving of their beards
by the clergy. The fifth only of the articles objected to by Photius, the procession
of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, was an error so awful
as to deserve a thousand anathemas. The third, condemning the enforced
celibacy of the clergy, was alone of high moral or religious importance.
“From this usage we see in the West,” says Photius, “so many children who
know not their fathers.” These, however, were but the pretexts for division.
The cause lay deeper, in the total denial of the papal supremacy by the
Greeks; their unequivocal assertion that with the empire that supremacy
had passed to Constantinople.</p>

<p>The decree of the council boasted the signature of the emperor (obtained,
it was said, in an hour of drunkenness); of Basil the Macedonian, averred
(most improbably) to have been forged; of the three eastern patriarchs;
of the senate and the great officers; of abbots and bishops to the number of
nearly one thousand. But the episcopal messenger who was to bear to Rome
this defiance of the church of Constantinople and the counter-excommunication
of the pope, had proceeded but a short way on his journey when he was
stopped by the orders of the new emperor. A revolution in the palace
was a revolution in the church of Constantinople. The first act of Basil
the Macedonian was to depose Photius. Photius is said to have refused the
communion to the murderer Basil. From this time a succession of changes
agitated the empire; Photius rose or fell at each successive change.</p>

<p>Leo the Philosopher, the son of Basil, once more ignominiously expelled
him from his throne. Yet, though accused of treason, Photius was acquitted
and withdrew into honoured retirement. He did not live to witness or
profit by another revolution. Though the schism of thirty years, properly
speaking, expired in his person, and again a kind of approximation to
Rome took place, yet the links were broken which united the two churches.
The articles of difference, from which neither would depart, had been defined
and hardened into rigid dogmas. During the dark times of the papacy
which followed the disruption, even the intercourse became more and more
precarious. The popes of the next century were too busy in defending
their territories or their lives to regard the affairs of the East. The
darkness which gathered round both churches shrouded them from each
other’s sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[860-867 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Nicholas the Great had not lived to triumph even in the first fall of Photius.
In the West his success was more complete; he had the full enjoyment
of conscious power exercised in a righteous cause. Not merely did he behold
one of Charlemagne’s successors prostrate at his feet, obliged to abandon to
papal censure and to degradation even his high ecclesiastical partisans, but
in succession the greatest prelates of the West, the archbishop of Ravenna,
the archbishops of Cologne and Trèves, and even Hincmar, the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_571"></a>[571]</span>
of Rheims, who seemed to rule despotically over the church and kingdom of
France, were forced to bow before his vigorous supremacy.</p>

<p>The matrimonial cause which for many years distracted part of France,
on which council after council met, and on which the great prelates of Lorraine
came into direct collision with the pope, and were reduced to complete
and unpitied humiliation under his authority, was that of King Lothair and
his queen Theutberga, as elsewhere described. He threatened the king with
immediate excommunication if he did not dismiss the concubine Waldrada,
and receive his repudiated queen. He then betook himself to Attigny, the
residence of Charles the Bald. He peremptorily commanded the restoration
of the bishop Rothrad, who had been canonically, as it was asserted, deposed
by Hincmar his metropolitan, and was now irregularly, without inquiry
or examination, replaced by the arbitrary mandate of the pope. Hincmar
murmured and obeyed; the trembling king acquiesced in the papal decree.</p>

<p>But Nicholas did not live to enjoy his perfect triumph; he died in November,
867 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>&mdash;a pontiff who, if he advanced no absolutely unexampled
pretensions to supremacy in behalf of the Roman see, yet, by the favourable
juncture and auspicious circumstances which he seized to assert and maintain
that authority, did more than all his predecessors to strengthen and confirm
it. During all his conflicts in the West with the royal and with the episcopal
power, the moral and religious sympathies of mankind could not but be
on his side. If his language was occasionally more violent, even contemptuous,
than became the moderation which, up to this time, had mitigated the
papal decrees, he might plead lofty and righteous indignation; if he interfered
with domestic relations, it was in defence of the innocent and defenceless,
and in vindication of the sanctity of marriage; if he treated kings with
scorn, it was because they had become contemptible for their weakness or
their vices; if he interfered with episcopal or metropolitan jurisdiction, the
inferior clergy, even bishops, would be pleased to have a remote, and possibly
disinterested tribunal, to which they might appeal from prelates, chosen only
from aristocratic connections, barbarians in occupation and in ferocity; if he
was inexorable to transgressors, it was to those of the highest order, prelates
who had lent themselves to injustice and iniquity, and had defied his power;
if he annulled councils, those councils had already been condemned for their
injustice, had deserved the reproachful appellation with which they were
branded by the pope, with all who had any innate or unperverted sentiment
of justice and purity. Hence the presumptuous usurpation even of divine
power, so long as it was thus beneficently used, awed, confounded all, and
offended few. Men took no alarm at the arrogance which befriended them
against the oppressor and the tyrant.</p>

<p>But this vast moral advancement of the popedom was not all which the
Roman see owes to Nicholas I; she owes the questionable boon of the recognition
of the <i>False Decretals</i> as the law of the church.</p>

<h5>THE <i>FALSE DECRETALS</i></h5>

<div class="sidenote">[858-869 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Nicholas I not only saw during his pontificate the famous <i>False Decretals</i>
take their place in the jurisprudence of Latin Christendom; if he did not
promulgate, he assumed them as authentic documents; he gave them the
weight of the papal sanction; and with their aid prostrated at his feet the one
great transalpine prelate who could still maintain the independence of the
Teutonic church, Hincmar archbishop of Rheims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572"></a>[572]</span></p>

<p>Up to this period the decretals, the letters or edicts of the bishops of
Rome, according to the authorised or common collection of Dionysius, commenced
with Pope Siricius, towards the close of the fourth century. To the
collection of Dionysius was added that of the authentic councils, which bore
the name of Isidore of Seville. On a sudden was promulgated, unannounced,
without preparation, not absolutely unquestioned, but apparently overawing
at once all doubt, a new code, which to the former authentic documents
added fifty-nine letters and decrees of the twenty oldest popes from Clement
to Melchiades (Miltiades), and the donation of Constantine; and in the third
part, among the decrees of the popes and of the councils from Silvester to
Gregory II, thirty-nine false decrees, and the acts of several unauthentic
councils. In this vast manual of sacerdotal Christianity the popes appear
from the first the parents, guardians, legislators of the faith throughout
the world. The <i>False Decretals</i> do not merely assert the supremacy of the
popes&mdash;the dignity and privileges of the bishop of Rome&mdash;they comprehend
the whole dogmatic system and discipline of the church, the whole hierarchy
from the highest to the lowest degree, their sanctity, and immunities, their
persecutions, their disputes, their right of appeal to Rome.</p>

<p>But for the too manifest design, the aggrandisement of the see of Rome
and the aggrandisement of the whole clergy in subordination to the see of
Rome; but for the monstrous ignorance of history, which betrays itself in
glaring anachronisms, and in the utter confusion of the order of events and
the lives of distinguished men&mdash;the former awakening keen and jealous
suspicion, the latter making the detection of the spuriousness of the whole
easy, clear, irrefragable&mdash;the <i>False Decretals</i> might still have maintained
their place in ecclesiastical history. They are now given up by all; not
a voice is raised in their favour; the utmost that is done by those who cannot
suppress all regret at their explosion, is to palliate the guilt of the forger, to
call in question or to weaken the influence which they had in their own day,
and throughout the later history of Christianity.</p>

<p>The author or authors of this most audacious and elaborate of pious frauds
are unknown; the date and place of its compilation are driven into such narrow
limits that they may be determined within a few years, and within a
very circumscribed region. The <i>False Decretals</i> came not from Rome; the
time of their arrival at Rome, after they were known beyond the Alps,
appears almost certain. In one year Nicholas I is apparently ignorant of
their existence, the next he speaks of them with full knowledge. They
contain words manifestly used at the Council of Paris (829 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>), consequently
are of later date; they were known to the Levite Benedict of Metz,
who composed a supplement to the collection of capitularies by Adgesil,
between 840-847 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> The city of Metz is designated with nearly equal
certainty as the place in which, if not actually composed, they were first
promulgated as the canon law of Christendom.</p>

<p>The state of affairs in the divided and distracted empire might seem almost
to call for, almost to justify, this desperate effort to strengthen the ecclesiastical
power. All the lower clergy, including some of the bishops, were
groaning, just at this time, under heavy oppression. By the constitution
of Charlemagne, which survived under Louis the Pious, and, so long as the
empire maintained its unity, asserted the independence of the transalpine
hierarchy of all but the temporal sovereign, the clergy were under strict
subordination to the bishop, the bishop to the metropolitan, the metropolitan
only to the emperor. Conflicting popes, or popes in conflict with Italian
enemies, or with their own subjects, had reduced the papacy to vassalage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_573"></a>[573]</span>
under the empire. Conflicting kings, on the division of the realm of Charlemagne,
had not yet, but were soon about to submit the empire to the Roman
supremacy. All at present was anarchy. The Germans and the French
were drawing asunder into separate rival nations; the sons of Louis were
waging an endless, implacable strife. Almost every year, less than every
decade of years, beheld a new partition of the empire; kingdoms rose and
fell, took new boundaries, acknowledged new sovereigns; no government
was strong enough to maintain the law; might was the only law.</p>

<p>The hierarchy, if not the whole clergy, had taken the lead in the disruption
of the unity of the empire; they had abased the throne of Louis; they were
for a short disastrous period now the victims of that abasement. Their wealth
was their danger. They had become secular princes, they had become nobles,
they had become vast landed proprietors. But during the civil wars it was
not the persuasive voice, but the strong arm, which had authority; the mitre
must bow before the helmet,
the crosier before the sword.
Not only the domains, the
persons of the clergy had
lost their sanctity. The
persecution and oppression
of the church and the clergy
had reached a height unknown
in former times.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p573.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">An Extract from St. Augustine’s Psalter</span></p>
</div>

<p>It might occur to the
most religious that for the
sake of religion; it might
occur to those to whom the
dignity and interest of the
sacerdotal order were their
religion, that some effort
must be made to reinvest
the clergy in their imperilled
sanctity. There must
be some appeal against this
secular, this ecclesiastical
tyranny; and whither
should appeal be? It could
not be to the Scriptures, to
the Gospel. It must be to ancient and venerable tradition, to the unrepealed,
irrepealable law of the church; to remote and awful Rome. Rome must be
proclaimed in an unusual, more emphatic manner, the eternal, immemorial
court of appeal. The tradition must not rest on the comparatively recent
names of Leo the Great, of Innocent the Great, of Siricius, or the right of
appeal depend on the decree of the Council of Sardica. It must come down
from the successors of St. Peter himself in unbroken succession. The whole
clergy must have a perpetual, indefeasible sanctity of the same antiquity.
So may the idea of this, to us it seems, monstrous fiction have dawned
upon its author; himself may have implicitly believed that he asserted no
prerogative for Rome which Rome herself had not claimed, which he did not
think to be her right. It is even now asserted, perhaps can hardly be disproved,
that the <i>False Decretals</i> advanced no pretensions in favour of the see
of Rome which had not been heard before in some vague and indefinite, but
not therefore less significant, language. The boldness of the act was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574"></a>[574]</span>
new authority in which it arrayed these pretensions. The new code was
enshrined, as it were, in a framework of deeply religious thought and language;
it was introduced under the venerated name of Isidore of Seville;
it was thus attached to the authentic work of Isidore, which had long
enjoyed undisputed authority. Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, as the
most powerful, so, perhaps, the most learned transalpine ecclesiastic, who
might at once have exposed the fiction, which he could hardly but know to
be a fiction, co-operated more than anyone else to establish its authority.
So long as he supposed it to advance or confirm his own power, he suppressed
all intrusive doubts; he discovered too late that it was a trap (a mousetrap
is his own undignified word) to catch unwary metropolitans. Hincmar
was caught, beyond all hope of escape. In the appeal of Rothrad, bishop
of Soissons, against Hincmar, metropolitan of Rheims, Pope Nicholas I at
first alleges no word of the new decretals in favour of his right of appeal; he
seemingly knows no older authority than that of Innocent, Leo, Siricius,
and the Council of Sardica. The next year not merely is he fully master
of the pseudo-Isidorian documents, but he taunts Hincmar with now calling
in question, when it makes against him, authority which he was ready to
acknowledge in confirmation of his own power. Hincmar is forced to the
humiliation of submission. Rothrad, deposed by Hincmar, deposed by
the Council of Senlis, is reinstated in his see.</p>

<p>This immediate, if somewhat cautious, adoption of the fiction, unquestionably
not the forgery, by Pope Nicholas, appears less capable of charitable
palliation than the original invention. Nor did the successors of Nicholas
betray any greater scruple in strengthening themselves by this welcome, and
therefore only unsuspicious aid. It is impossible to deny that, at least by
citing without reserve or hesitation, the Roman pontiffs gave their deliberate
sanction to this great historic fraud.</p>

<p>Nor must be overlooked, perhaps, the more important result of the acceptance
of the pseudo-Isidorian statutes as the universal, immemorial, irrepealable
law of Christendom. It established the great principle which
Nicholas I had before announced, of the sole legislative power of the pope.
Every one of these papal epistles was a canon of the church; every future
bull therefore rested on the same irrefragable authority, commanded the
same implicit obedience. The papacy became a legislative as well as an administrative
authority. Infallibility was the next inevitable step, if infallibility
was not already in the power asserted to have been bestowed by the
Lord on St. Peter, by St. Peter handed down in unbroken descent, and in a
plenitude which could not be restricted or limited, to his successors.</p>

<h5>ADRIAN II</h5>

<p>Nicholas was succeeded (November, 867) by Adrian II, a rigid and lofty
churchman, who, though his policy at first appeared doubtful, resolutely
maintained, but not with equal judgment and success, the principles of his
predecessor. Adrian (he was now seventy-five years old) had been married
before he became a priest. At the intercession of the emperor Louis, he took
off the ban of excommunication from Waldrada, and restored her to the communion
of the church. By this lenity he might seem to lure King Lothair
to the last act of submission. The king of Lorraine arrived in Italy. The
pope seemed to yield to the influence of Louis and the empress Ingelberga;
at least he accepted the munificent presents of the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575"></a>[575]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">[869-876 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>From Monte Cassino, where they first met, Lothair followed the pope to
Rome. There, instead of being received as a king, and as one reconciled
with the see of Rome, when he entered the church all was silent and vacant;
not one of the clergy appeared; he retired to a neighbouring chamber,
which was not even swept for his reception. The next day was Sunday,
and he hoped to hear the mass chanted before him. The pope refused him
this honour. He dined, however, the next day with the pope, and an interchange
of presents took place. At length Adrian consented to admit him to
the communion.</p>

<p>Pope Adrian seized the occasion of the contest for the kingdom of
Lothair to advance still more daring and unprecedented pretensions. But
the world was not yet ripe for this broad and naked assertion of secular
power by the pope, his claim to interfere in the disposal of kingdoms.
Directly he left the strong ground of moral and religious authority, from
which his predecessor Nicholas had commanded the world, he encountered
insurmountable resistance. With all that remained of just and generous
sympathy on their side popes might intermeddle in the domestic relations
of kings; they were not permitted as yet to touch the question of royal
succession or inheritance. The royal and the episcopal power had quailed
before Nicholas; the fulminations of Adrian were treated with contempt or
indifference: and Hincmar of Rheims in this quarrel with Adrian regained
that independence and ascendency which had been obscured by his temporary
submission to Nicholas.</p>

<p>Nicholas I and Adrian II thus, with different success, imperiously dictating
to sovereigns, ruling or attempting to rule the higher clergy in foreign
countries with a despotic sway, mingling in the political revolutions of
Europe, awarding crowns, and adjudging kingly inheritances, might seem
the immediate ancestors of Gregory VII, of Innocent III, of Boniface VIII.
But the papacy had to undergo a period of gloom and degradation, even of
guilt, before it emerged again to its height of power.</p>

<p>The pontificate of John VIII (872) is the turning-point in this gradual,
but rapid and almost total change; among its causes were the extinction of
the imperial branch of the Carlovingian race and the frequent transference
of the empire from one line of sovereigns to another; with the growth of the
formidable dukes and counts in Italy, which overshadowed the papal power
and reduced the pope himself to the slave or the victim of one of the contending
factions. The pope was elected, deposed, imprisoned, murdered.
In the wild turbulence of the times not merely the reverence but the sanctity
of his character disappeared. He sank to the common level of mortals;
and the head of Christendom was as fierce and licentious as the petty princes
who surrounded him, out of whose stock he sprang, and whose habits he did
not break off when raised to the papal throne.</p>

<p>John VIII, however, still stood on the vantage ground occupied by
Nicholas I and Adrian II. He was a Roman by birth. He signalised his
pontificate by an act even more imposing than those of his predecessors, the
nomination to the empire, which his language represented rather as a
grant from the papal authority than as an hereditary dignity; it was a direct
gift from heaven, conveyed at the will of the pope. Already there appear
indications of a French and German interest contending for the papal influence
which grows into more and more decided faction, till the Carlovingian
empire is united, soon to be dissolved forever, in the person of Charles the
Fat. John VIII adopted the dangerous policy of a partial adherence to
France. But the historians are almost unanimous as to the price which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576"></a>[576]</span>
Charles was compelled to pay for his imperial crown. He bought the pope,
he bought the senators of Rome; he bought, if we might venture to take the
words to the letter, St. Peter himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[876-878 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The imperial reign of Charles the Bald was short and inglorious. The
whole pontificate of John VIII was a long, if at times interrupted, agony of
apprehension lest Rome should fall into the hands of the unbeliever. The
reign of the late emperor Louis had been almost a continual warfare against
the Mohammedans, who had now obtained a firm footing in southern Italy.
He had successfully repelled their progress, but at the death of Louis Rome
was again in danger of becoming a Mohammedan city. The pope wrote
letter after letter in the most urgent and feeling language to Charles the
Bald soon after he had invested him with the empire. “If all the trees in
the forest,” such is the style of the pope, “were turned into tongues, they
could not describe the ravages of these impious pagans; the devout people
of God are destroyed by a continual slaughter; he who escapes the fire and the
sword is carried as a captive into exile. Cities, castles, and villages are
utterly wasted, and without an inhabitant. The bishops are wandering
about in beggary, or fly to Rome as the only place of refuge.”</p>

<p>Yet, if possible, even more formidable than the infidels were the petty
Christian princes of Italy. “The canker-worm eats what the locust has
left.” In many parts of Italy had gradually arisen independent dukedoms;
and none of these appear to have felt any religious respect for the pope, some
not for Christianity. On the vacancy after the death of Pope Nicholas,
Lambert of Spoleto had occupied and pillaged Rome, respecting neither
monastery nor church, and carrying off a great number of young females of
the highest rank. Adelchis, the duke of Benevento, had dared to seize in
that city the sacred person of the emperor Louis. He was only permitted
to leave the city after he had taken a solemn oath to Adelchis&mdash;an oath in
which his wife, his daughter, and all his attendants were compelled to join&mdash;that
he would neither in his own person nor by any other revenge this act
of insolent rebellion. No sooner, however, had Louis reached Ravenna in
safety than he sent to the pope to absolve him from his oath. Adrian II,
then pope, began to assert that dangerous privilege of absolution from solemn
and recorded oaths.</p>

<p>The bishop-duke of Spoleto did not scruple to return to the unhallowed
policy of his brother. He entered into a new league with the Saracens, gave
them quarters, and actually uniting his troops with theirs, defeated the
forces of Benevento, Capua, and Salerno, and opened a free passage for their
incursions to the gates of Rome.</p>

<p>The imperial crown was again vacant, and claimed by the conflicting
houses of France and Germany. But Carloman, son of Ludwig of Germany,
had been acknowledged as king of Italy. Probably as partisans of the
German, and to compel the pope to abandon the interest of the French line,
to which he adhered with unshaken fidelity, Lambert, duke of Spoleto, that
antichrist, as the pope described him, with his adulterous sister, Richildis,
and his accomplice, the treacherous Adalbert, count of Tuscany, at the head
of an irresistible force, entered Rome, seized and confined the pope, and
endeavoured to starve him into concession, and compelled the clergy and the
Romans to take an oath of allegiance to Carloman, as king of Italy. For
thirty days the religious services were interrupted; not a single lamp burned
on the altars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[878-891 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>No sooner had they retired than the pope caused all the sacred treasures
to be conveyed from St. Peter’s to the Lateran, covered the altar of St. Peter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577"></a>[577]</span>
with sackcloth, closed the doors, and refused to permit the pilgrims from
distant lands to approach the shrine. He then fled to Ostia, and embarked
for France.</p>

<p>When he reached the shores of Provence, John VIII felt himself in
another world. Instead of turbulent and lawless enemies (such were the
counts and dukes of Italy) whose rapacity or animosity paid no respect to
sacred things, and treated the pope like an ordinary mortal, the whole kingdom
of France might seem to throw itself humbly at his feet. No pope
was more prodigal of excommunication than John VIII. Of his letters (above
three hundred) it is remarkable how large a proportion threaten, inflict, or at
least allude to this last exercise of sacerdotal power.</p>

<p>The indefatigable pope returned over the Alps by the Mont Cenis, to
Turin and Pavia; but of all whom he had so commandingly exhorted, and so
earnestly implored to march for his protection against the Saracens, and
no doubt against his Italian enemies, none obeyed but Duke Boson of Provence.
The Saracens, in the meantime, courted by all parties, impartially
plundered all, made or broke alliances with the same facility with the Christians,
while the poor monks, even of St. Benedict’s own foundation, lived
in perpetual fear of spoliation. The last days of John VIII were occupied in
writing more and more urgent letters for aid to Charles the Fat, in warfare,
or providing means of war against his Saracen and Christian foes, or dealing
excommunications on all sides; yet facing with gallant resolution the foes of
his person and his power. This violent pope is said (but by one writer only)
to have come to a violent end; his brains were beaten out with a mallet
by some enemy, covetous of his wealth and ambitious of the papal crown.</p>

<p>The short pontificate of Marinus (Marinus I or Martin II) was followed
by the still shorter rule of Adrian III, which lasted but fourteen months.
That of Stephen V, though not of longer duration, witnessed events of far
more importance to the papacy, to Italy, and to Christendom. On the death
of Charles the Fat, the ill-cemented edifice of the Carlovingian Empire, the
discordant materials of which had reunited, not by natural affinity but almost
by the force of accident, dissolved again and forever. The legitimate race of
Charlemagne expired in the person of his unworthy descendant, whose name,
derived from mere physical bulk, contrasted with the mental greatness, the
commanding qualities of military, administrative, and even intellectual
superiority which had blended with the name of the first Charles the appellation
of the Great.</p>

<h5>POPE FORMOSUS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[891-897 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The death of Stephen, September, 891, and the election of Formosus to
the papacy, changed the aspect of affairs, and betrayed the hostilities still
rankling at Rome. By the election of Formosus was violated the ordinary
canonical rule against the translation of bishops from one see to another
(Formosus was bishop of Porto), which was still held in some respect.
There were yet stronger objections to the election of a bishop who had been
excommunicated by a former pontiff, excommunicated as an accomplice in a
conspiracy to murder the pope. The excommunicated Formosus had been
compelled to take an oath never to resume his episcopal functions, never to
return to Rome, and never to presume but to lay communion. The successor
of John had granted absolution from these penalties, from this oath.</p>

<p>This election must have been a desperate measure of an unscrupulous
faction. Nor was Formosus chosen without a fierce and violent struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578"></a>[578]</span></p>

<p>The suffrages of a party among the clergy and people had already
fallen upon Sergius. He was actually at the altar preparing for the solemn
ceremony of inauguration, when he was torn away by the stronger faction.
Formosus, chosen, as his partisans declared, for his superior learning and
knowledge of the Scripture, was then invested in the papal dignity.</p>

<p>When Pope Formosus died, May 23rd, 896, the election fell to Boniface
VII. The new pontiff laboured under the imputation of having been twice
deposed for his profligate and scandalous life, first from the subdiaconate,
afterwards from the priesthood. Boniface died of the gout fifteen days after
his elevation. The Italian party hastened to the election of Stephen VI.</p>

<p>Probably the German governor
had withdrawn before Stephen
and his faction proceeded to
wreak their vengeance on the lifeless
remains of Formosus. Fierce
political animosity took the form
of ecclesiastical solemnity. The
body was disinterred, dressed in
the papal habiliments, and, before
a council assembled for the purpose,
addressed in these words:
“Wherefore wert thou, being
bishop of Porto, tempted by
ambition to usurp the Catholic
see of Rome?” The deacon who
had been assigned as counsel for
the dead maintained a prudent
silence. The sacred vestments
were then stripped from the body,
three of the fingers cut off, the
body cast into the Tiber. All who
had been ordained by Formosus
were reordained by Stephen.
Such, however, were the vicissitudes
of popular feeling in Rome,
that some years after a miracle
was said to have asserted the
innocence of Formosus. His body
was found by fishermen in the Tiber, and carried back for burial in the church
of St. Peter. As the coffin passed, all the images in the church reverentially
bowed their heads.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p578.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Monk of the Middle Ages</span></p>
</div>

<p>The pontificate of Stephen soon came to an end. A new revolution
revenged the disinterment of the insulted prelate. And now the fierceness
of political rather than religious faction had utterly destroyed all reverence
for the sacred person of the pope. Stephen was thrown into prison by his
enemies, and strangled. The convenient charge of usurpation, always brought
against the popes whom their adversaries dethroned or put to death, may have
reconciled their minds to the impious deed, but it is difficult to discover in
what respect the title of Pope Stephen VI was defective.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[897-911 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Pope now succeeded pope with such rapidity as to awaken the inevitable
suspicion, either that those were chosen who were likely to make a speedy
vacancy, or they received but a fatal gift in the pontificate of Rome. Romanus
and Theodore II survived their promotion each only a few months. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579"></a>[579]</span>
latter, by his restoration of Formosus to the rights of Christian burial, and
by his reversal of the acts of Stephen VI, may be presumed to have belonged
to that faction. The next election was contested with all the strength and
violence of the adverse parties. John IX was successful; his competitor
Sergius, according to some accounts formerly the discomfited competitor of
Formosus, and his bitter and implacable enemy, fled to the powerful protection
of the marquis of Tuscany. Sergius was excommunicated, with several
other priests and inferior clergy, as accessory to the insults against the body
of Formosus. Sergius laughed to scorn the thunders of his rival, so long
as he was under the protection of the powerful house of Tuscany. With John
IX, who died July, 901, closed the ninth century of Christianity; the tenth,
in Italy at least the iron age, had already darkened upon Rome; the pontificate
had been won by crime and vacated by murder.</p>

<p>This iron age, as it has been called, opened with the pontificate of Benedict
IV (900-903), the successor of John IX. The only act recorded of
Benedict IV was the coronation of the unfortunate Louis of Provence, the
competitor of Berengar for the empire. Louis, according to imperial usage,
set up his tribunal and adjudged causes at Rome. On the death of Benedict,
the prudent precautions established by John IX to introduce some regularity
and control over the anarchy of an election by a clergy rent into factions
by a lawless nobility, and still more lawless people, during this utter
helplessness and the abeyance, or the strife for the empire between rival
princes, fell into utter neglect or impotency. The papacy became the prize
of the most active, daring, and violent. Leo V won the prize; before two
months he was ejected and thrown into prison by Christopher, one of his
own presbyters and chaplains. The same year, or early in the next, Christopher
was in his turn ignominiously driven from Rome.</p>

<p>It was under the protection of the powerful Tuscan prince Berengar that
the exiled Sergius, at the head of a strong force of Tuscan soldiers, appeared
in Rome, deposed Christopher, who had just deposed Leo V, and
took possession of the papal throne. Sergius had been seven years an exile
in Tuscany; for seven years he ruled as supreme but not undisputed pontiff.
This pope has been loaded with every vice and every enormity which can
blacken the character of man. Yet as to his reign there is almost total
obscurity. The only certain act which has transpired is his restoration of
the Lateran palace, which had fallen into ruins; an act which indicates a
period of comparative peace and orderly administration, with the command
of a large revenue. In these violent times Sergius probably scrupled at no
violence; but if he drove a pope from the throne of St. Peter, that pope had
just before deposed his patron, and with great cruelty.</p>

<h5>THEODORA IN POWER</h5>

<p>But during the papacy of Sergius rose into power the infamous Theodora,
with her daughters Marozia and Theodora, the prostitutes who, in the strong
language of historians, disposed for many years the papal tiara, and not
content with disgracing by their own licentious lives the chief city of
Christendom, actually placed their profligate paramours or base-born sons in
the chair of St. Peter. The influence obtained by Theodora and her daughters,
if it shows not the criminal connivance of Pope Sergius, or a still more
disgraceful connection with which he was charged by the scandal of the
times, proves at least the utter degradation of the papal power in Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580"></a>[580]</span>
It had not only lost all commanding authority, but could not even maintain
outward decency. Theodora was born of a noble and wealthy senatorial
family, on whom she has entailed an infamous immortality. The women of
Rome seem at successive periods seized with a kind of Roman ambition to
surpass their sex by the greatness of their virtues and of their vices. These
females were to the Paulas and Eustochiums of the younger and severer
age of Roman Christianity, what the Julias and Messallinas of the empire
were to the Volumnias and Cornelias of the republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[911-928 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It must be acknowledged that if the stern language of Tacitus and
Juvenal may have darkened the vices of the queens and daughters of the
cæsars, the bishop of Cremona,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2s1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2s">s</a></span> our chief authority on the enormities of Theodora
and her daughters, wants the moral dignity, while he is liable to the same
suspicion as those great writers. Throughout the lives of the pontiffs themselves
we have to balance between the malignant license of satire and the
unmeaning phrases of adulatory panegyric. On the other hand it is difficult
to decide which is more utterly unchristian&mdash;the profound hatred which
could invent or accredit such stories; the utter dissoluteness which made them
easily believed; or the actual truth of such charges.</p>

<p>Liutprand<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2s2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2s">s</a></span> relates that John, afterwards the tenth pope of that name,
being employed in Rome on some ecclesiastical matters by the archbishop of
Ravenna, was the paramour of Theodora, who not only allowed but compelled
him to her embraces. John was first appointed to the see of Bologna; but
the archbishopric of Ravenna, the second ecclesiastical dignity in Italy, falling
vacant before he had been consecrated, he was advanced by the same
dominant influence to that see. But Theodora bore with impatience the
separation of two hundred miles from her lover. Anastasius III had succeeded
Sergius (911) and occupied the papacy for rather more than two
years; after him Lando for six months (913). On the death of Lando (914)
by a more flagrant violation of the canonical rule than that charged against
the dead body of Formosus, John was translated from the archiepiscopate of
Ravenna to the see of Rome. But Theodora, if she indeed possessed this
dictatorial power, and the clergy and people of Rome, if they yielded to her
dictation, may have been actuated by nobler and better motives than her
gratification of a lustful passion, if not by motives purely Christian. For
however the archbishop of Ravenna might be no example of piety or holiness
as the spiritual head of Christendom, he appears to have been highly qualified
for the secular part of his office. He was a man of ability and daring,
eminently wanted at this juncture to save Rome from becoming the prey of
Mohammedan conquest, organising a powerful confederacy of neighbouring
dukes to accomplish this purpose.</p>

<p>He placed himself at the head of the army, and for the first time the successor
of St. Peter, the vicar of the Prince of peace, rode forth in his array
to battle. And if success, as it doubtless was, might be interpreted as a
manifestation of divine approval, the total discomfiture of the Saracens and
the destruction of the troublesome fortress on the Garigliano seemed to
sanction this new and unseemly character assumed by the pope. Even the
apostles sanctioned or secured by their presence the triumph of the warlike
pope.</p>

<p>For fourteen years (914-928), obscure as regards Rome and the pontificate,
this powerful prelate occupied the see of Rome. If he gained it (a
doubtful charge) by the vices and influence of the mother Theodora, he lost
it, together with his life, by the no less flagrant vices and more monstrous
power of the daughter Marozia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581"></a>[581]</span></p>

<h5>THE INFAMOUS MAROZIA</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[925-931 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Theodora disappears; and Pope John X is found engaged in a fierce contest
for the mastery of Rome with Marozia and her lover or husband, the
marquis Alberic, by whom she had a son of the same name, afterwards tyrant
of the city. The vigorous and martial pontiff succeeds in expelling Alberic
from the city; Alberic probably met his death soon after (925). It is said
that he was murdered by the Romans in revenge for some secret alliance entered
into with the Hungarians, who were then wasting Italy, and had reached
the very frontiers of Calabria.</p>

<p>The death of her husband increased rather than weakened the power of
Marozia. Her personal charms, and her unscrupulous use of them, are said
to have multiplied to an infinite extent her adherents. Her paramours made
a strong party. The empire was vacant. There was no potentate to whom
the pope could appeal. Marozia seized the castle of St. Angelo, and with
this precious dowry, which commanded Rome, she sought to confirm her
power by some splendid alliance. Guido, the duke of Tuscany, the son of
Adalbert the marquis, did not disdain the nuptials with a profligate woman
who brought Rome as her marriage portion.</p>

<p>John X was left to contest alone the government of Rome with Marozia
and her Tuscan husband. Neither Rome nor the mistress of Rome regarded
the real services rendered by John X to Christendom and to Italy. The
former lover, as public scandal averred, of her mother, the saviour of Rome
from the Saracens, was surprised in the Lateran palace by this daring woman.
His brother Peter, as it appears, his great support in the contest for the government
of Rome, and therefore the object of peculiar hatred to Guido and
Marozia, was killed before his face. The pope was thrown into prison, where
some months after he died (929) either of anguish and despair, or by more
summary means. It was rumoured that he was smothered with a pillow.
No means were too violent for Marozia to employ even against a pope.</p>

<p>Marozia did not venture at once to place her son on the papal throne.
A Leo VI was pope for some months; a Stephen VII for two years and one
month. That son may as yet have been too young even for this shameless
woman to advance him to the highest ecclesiastical dignity; her husband
Guido may have had some lingering respect for the sacred office, some struggling
feelings of decency. But at the death of Stephen, Marozia again ruled
alone in Rome; her husband Guido was dead, and her son was pope. John
XI (according to the rumours of the time, of which Liutprand,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2s3"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2s">s</a></span> a follower of
Hugo of Provence, may be accepted as a faithful reporter) was the offspring
of Marozia by the pope Sergius; more trustworthy authorities make him
the lawful son of her husband Alberic. But the obsequious clergy and
people acquiesced without resistance in the commands of their patrician
mistress; the son of Marozia is successor of St. Peter.</p>

<p>But the aspiring Marozia, not content with having been the wife of a
marquis, the wife of the wealthy and powerful duke of Tuscany, perhaps the
mistress of one, certainly the mother of another pope, looked still higher in
her lustful ambition; she must wed a monarch. She sent to offer herself
and the city of Rome to the new king of Italy, Hugo of Provence, who was
not scrupulous in his amours, lawful or unlawful. Through policy or
through passion he was always ready to form or to break these tender connections.
The cautious Marozia would not allow his army to enter the city,
but received her royal bridegroom in the castle of St. Angelo. There was
celebrated this unhallowed marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582"></a>[582]</span></p>

<h5>REBELLION OF ROME</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[931-953 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p582.jpg" width="200" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bishop of the Tenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>But though the Romans would brook the dominion of a Roman woman,
they would not endure that of a foreigner. The coarse vices, the gluttony
of the soldiers of Hugo offended the fastidious Italians. The insolence of
Hugo himself provoked a rebellion. The nobles were called upon to perform
menial offices, usual probably in the half feudal transalpine courts but alien
to Italian manners. Alberic, the son of Marozia, was commanded to hold
the water in which King Hugo washed his hands. Performing his office
awkwardly or reluctantly, he spilled the water, and received a blow on the
face from the king. Already may Alberic have
been jealous of the promotion of his brother to
the popedom, and have resented this devotion
of his mother to her new foreign connections.
He was a youth of daring; he organised a conspiracy
among the nobles of Rome; he appealed
to the old Roman pride: “Shall these Burgundians,
of old the slaves of Rome, tyrannise
over Romans?” At the tolling of the bell the
whole people flocked to his banner, and attacked
the castle of St. Angelo before Hugo could admit
his own troops. Alberic remained master
of the castle, of his mother, and of the pope.
These two he cast into prison, defied the king
of Italy, who made an ignominious retreat, and
from that time remained master of Rome.</p>

<p>For four years Pope John XI lingered in
fact a prisoner, at least without any share in the
government of Rome, only permitted to perform
his spiritual functions. Alberic ruled undisturbed.
King Hugo attempted to bribe him
to the surrender of Rome, by the offer of his
daughter in marriage; the more crafty Alberic
married the daughter, and retained possession
of Rome. After the death of John a succession
of popes, appointed, no doubt, by the sole
will of Alberic, Leo VII, Stephen IX, Marinus
II (or Martin III) Agapetus II, pass over
the throne of the popedom, with hardly a sign
of their power in Rome, no indication of their
dignity, still less of their sanctity. They are
still Popes beyond the Alps. Nor was the supreme pontiff alone depressed
in these turbulent times. The great ecclesiastics are mingled in most of
the treacherous and bloody transactions of the period. Individual energy
gave the bishops of the city great power, but as they acted with as little
restraint, so these prelates were treated with as little reverence as secular
princes.</p>

<p>During the whole reign of Hugo of Provence, notwithstanding the open
or treacherous assaults of that king, Alberic, whether as an armed tyrant
commanding Rome from the castle of St. Angelo, or as the head of a republic
and recognised by the voice of the Roman people, had maintained his authority.
He had ruled for twenty-two years; he bequeathed that authority, on his
death (953), to his son Octavian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583"></a>[583]</span></p>

<h5>POPE JOHN XII</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[953-963 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Octavian, though only nineteen years old, aspired to unite, in his own
person, the civil and spiritual supremacy. He was already in holy orders;
two years after the death of his father Alberic, the pope Agapetus II died;
and Octavian, by the voluntary or enforced suffrages of the clergy and the
people, was elected pope. He was the first of the Roman pontiffs who
changed, or rather took a second ecclesiastical name; the civil government
seems to have been conducted in that of Octavian; the church was administered
under that of John XII.</p>

<p>In the meantime had arisen in Germany a monarch more powerful than had
appeared in Europe since the death of Charlemagne, Otto (Otho) the Great.
Otto made some disposition for a visit to Rome to receive the imperial crown
from the hands of the pope Agapetus. All Italy looked for the coming of the
new Charlemagne. On his appearance resistance vanished. Berengar and
Adalbert shut themselves up in their strongest fortresses. It was a triumphal
procession to Pavia&mdash;to Rome. At Pavia Otto the Great was crowned
king of Italy, at Rome the pope anointed him as emperor (962). Thenceforth
the king of Germany claimed to be Western emperor. Otto swore to
protect the church of Rome against all her enemies, to maintain her rights
and privileges, to restore her lands and possessions, when he should have
recovered them, and to make no change in the government of Rome without
the sanction of the pope. John XII and the Roman people took the oath of
allegiance to the emperor; they swore more particularly to abandon all connection
with Berengar and his son. The oath was taken on the body of
St. Peter.</p>

<p>Yet no sooner had the emperor returned to Pavia, than the perfidious
John, finding that he had unwarily introduced a master instead of an obsequious
ally, began to enter into correspondence with Adalbert, who, driven
from every Italian city, had found refuge with the Saracens. Rumours of
this treason reached the emperor. The noble German would not believe
the monstrous perfidy; he sent some trustworthy officers to inquire into the
truth; they returned with a fearful list of crimes, of license, and cruelty,
with which the son of Alberic, who seems entirely to have sunk the character
of pope in that of the young, warlike, secular prince, was charged by the
unanimous voice of Rome. In July, 963, Otto marched upon the capital; the
pontiff had reckoned on the cordial support of the people; they recoiled;
the pope and Adalbert fled together from Rome.</p>

<h5>TRIAL OF THE POPE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[963-964 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The emperor summoned an ecclesiastical council; it was attended by the
archbishops of Aquileia (by deputy), of Milan, of Ravenna, and Hamburg;
by two German and two French metropolitans; by a great number of
bishops and presbyters from Lombardy, Tuscany, and all parts of Italy.
The whole militia of Rome assembled as a guard to the council round the
church of St. Peter. The proceedings of the council mark the times.
Inquiry was made why the pope was not present. A general cry of astonishment
broke forth from the clergy and the people: “The very Iberians,
Babylonians, and Indians have heard the monstrous crimes of the pope.
He is not a wolf who condescends to sheep’s clothing; his cruelty, his
diabolical dealings are open, avowed, disdain concealment.” The calmer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584"></a>[584]</span>
justice of the emperor demanded specific charges. The cardinal presbyter
rose and declared that he had seen Pope John celebrate mass without himself
communicating. Another, that he had ordained a bishop in a stable; that
he had taken bribes for the consecration of bishops, and had ordained a
bishop of Todi who was but ten years old. “For his sacrileges, all eyes
might behold them;” they alluded, probably, to the dilapidation of the
churches, which were open to the weather, and so much out of repair that
the worshippers could not assemble from fear lest the roofs should fall on
their heads.</p>

<p>Darker charges followed, mingled with less heinous, in strange confusion,
charges of adultery, incest, with the names of the females, one his father’s
concubines, another a widow and her niece; he had made the Lateran palace
a brothel; he had been guilty of hunting; charges of cruelty, the blinding
of one dignified ecclesiastic, the castrating another, both had died under the
operation; he had let loose fire and sword, and appeared himself constantly
armed with sword, lance, helmet, and breast-plate. Both ecclesiastics and
laymen accused him of drinking wine for the love of the devil; of invoking,
when gambling, heathen deities, the devils Jove and Venus. He had perpetually
neglected matins and vespers, and never signed himself with the
sign of the cross.</p>

<p>The emperor could speak only German; he commanded the bishop of
Cremona to address the assembly in Latin. Liutprand warned the council,
he adjured them by the blessed Virgin and by St. Peter, not to bring vague
accusations, nor such as could not be supported by accredited testimony,
against the holy father. Bishops, deacons, clergy, and people with one voice
replied, “If we do not prove these and more crimes against the pope, may
St. Peter, who holds the keys of heaven, close the gates against us; may we
be stricken with anathema, and may the anathema be ratified at the day of
judgment!” They appealed to the whole army of Otto, whether they had
not seen the pope in full armour on the other side of the Tiber; but for the
river he had been taken in that attire.</p>

<p>Letters were sent summoning the pope to answer to these accusations;
accusations some of them so obscene that they would have been thought immodest
if made against stage-players. If the pope dreaded any assault from
the enraged multitude, the emperor answered for the security of his person.
The pope’s reply was brief, contemptuous: “John, the servant of God, to all
the bishops. We hear that you design to elect a new pope; if you do, in the
name of Almighty God, I excommunicate you; and forbid you to confer
orders or to celebrate mass!”</p>

<p>Thrice was Pope John cited before the council. Messengers were sent
to Tivoli; the answer was, “The pope was gone out to shoot.” Unprecedented
evils demand unprecedented remedies. The emperor was urged to
expel this new Judas from the seat of the apostle, and to sanction a new
election. Leo, the chief secretary of the Roman see, was unanimously chosen,
though a layman, in the room of the apostate John XII.</p>

<p>But the army of Otto, a feudal army, and bound to do service for a limited
period, began to diminish; part had been injudiciously dispersed on
distant enterprises; the Romans, as usual, soon grew weary of a foreign,
a German yoke. The emissaries of Pope John watched the opportunity; a
furious insurrection of the people broke out against the emperor and his
pope. The valour of Otto, who forced the barricades of the bridge over the
Tiber, subdued the rebellion (964). He took a terrible revenge. The supplications
of Leo with difficulty arrested the carnage. Otto soon after left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585"></a>[585]</span>
Rome, and marched towards Camerino (Camerinum) and Spoleto in pursuit
of King Adalbert. The king Berengar and his wife Willa were taken in the
castle of St. Leo, and sent into Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[964-966 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Hardly, however, had Otto left the city when a new rebellion, organised
by the patrician females of Rome, rose on the defenceless Leo, and opened
the gates of the city to John. Leo with difficulty escaped to the camp
of Otto. The remorseless John re-entered the city, resumed his pontifical
state, seized and mutilated the leaders of the imperial party; of one he cut
off the right hand, of another the tongue, the nose, and two fingers; in this
plight they appeared in the imperial camp. An obsequious synod reversed
the decrees of that which had deposed John. The Roman people had now
embraced the cause of the son of Alberic with more resolute zeal; for the
emperor was compelled to delay till he could reassemble a force powerful
enough to undertake the siege of the city. Ere this, however, his own vices
had delivered Rome from her champion or her tyrant, Christendom from her
worst pontiff. While he was pursuing his amours in a distant part of the
city, Pope John XII was struck dead (May 14th, 964), by the hand of God,
as the more religious supposed; others, by a more natural cause, the poniard
of an injured husband.</p>

<p>But it was a Roman or Italian, perhaps a republican feeling which had
latterly attached the citizens to the son of Alberic, not personal love or respect
for his pontifical character. They boldly proceeded at once, without
regard to the emperor, to the election of a new pope, Benedict V. Otto soon appeared
before the walls; he summoned the city, and ordered every Roman who
attempted to escape to be mutilated. The republic was forced to surrender.
Benedict, the new pope, was brought before the emperor. The cardinal
archdeacon, who had adhered to the cause of Leo, demanded by what right
he had presumed to usurp the pontifical robes during the life-time of Leo, the
lawful pope. “If I have sinned,” said the humbled prelate, “have mercy
upon me.” The emperor is said to have wept. Benedict threw himself
before the feet of Otto, drew off the sacred pallium, and delivered up his
crosier to Leo. Leo broke it, and showed it to the people. Benedict was
degraded to the order of deacon and sent into banishment in Germany.
He died at Hamburg.</p>

<p>The grateful, or vassal pope, in a council, recognises the full right of the
emperor Otto and his successors in the kingdom of Italy, as Adrian that of
Charlemagne, to elect his own successors to the empire and to approve the
pope. This right was to belong forever to the king of the Roman Empire,
and to none else.</p>

<p>Early in the next year the emperor Otto recrossed the Alps. Leo VIII
died March, 965, and a deputation from Rome followed the emperor to Germany
to solicit the reinstatement of the exiled Benedict to the popedom.
But Benedict was dead also. The bishop of Narni (John XIII), with the
approbation or by the command of the emperor, was elected to the papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[966-974 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Scarcely had John XIII assumed the pontificate than the barons and the
people began to murmur against the haughtiness of the new pontiff. They
expelled him from the city with one consent. The prefect Rotfred, not
without personal insult to the pope, assumed the government of Rome; for
ten months John XIII was an exile from his see, at first a prisoner, afterwards
in freedom. From his retreat in Campania he wrote with urgent
entreaty to the emperor. Otto made the cause of John his own; for the third
time he descended the Alps; the terror of his approach appalled the
popular faction. In a counter insurrection in favour of the pope, Rotfred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586"></a>[586]</span>
the prefect was killed, and the gates opened to the pontiff; he was received
with hymns of joy and gratulation. At Christmas Otto entered Rome; and
the emperor and the pope wreaked a terrible vengeance at that holy season
on the rebellious city. The proud Roman titles seemed but worthy of derision
to the German emperor and his vassal pope.
The body of the prefect who had expelled John
from the city was dug up out of his grave and
torn to pieces. The consuls escaped with banishment
beyond the Alps; but the twelve tribunes
were hanged; the actual prefect was set
upon an ass, with a wine-bag on his head, led
through the streets, scourged, and thrown into
prison. All Europe, hardened as it was to acts
of inhumanity, shuddered at these atrocities.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bishop of the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries</span></p>
</div>

<p>The rebellion was crushed for a time; during
the five remaining years of John’s pontificate
the presence of Otto overawed the refractory
Romans. He ruled in peace. At his death the
undisturbed vacancy of the see for three months
implies the humble consultation of Otto’s wishes
(he had now returned to Germany) on the appointment
of his successor.</p>

<p>The choice fell on Benedict VI, as usual of
Roman birth (January 19th, 973). The factions
of Rome now utterly baffle conjecture as
to their motives, as to the passions, not the principles,
which actuated their leaders. Twice
(the second time after an interval of ten years,
during which he was absent from Rome), the
same man, a cardinal deacon, seizes and murders
two popes; sets himself up as supreme
pontiff; but though with power to commit these
enormities, he cannot maintain on either occasion
his ill-won tiara.</p>

<p>The formidable Otto the Great died the year
of the accession of Benedict VI (December 25th, 967). Otto II, whose
character was as yet unknown, had succeeded to the imperial throne; he
had been already the colleague of his father in the empire. He had been
crowned at Rome by Pope John XIII.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[974-985 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The year after the accession of Otto II, on a sudden, Boniface, surnamed
Francone, described as the son of Ferruccio, a name doubtless well known to
his contemporaries, seized the unsuspecting pope Benedict and cast him into
a dungeon (July, 974), where shortly after he was strangled. Boniface
assumed the papacy, but he had miscalculated the strength of his faction; in
one month he was forced to fly the city. Yet he fled not with so much haste
but that he carried off all the treasures, even the sacred vessels from the
church of St. Peter. He found his way to Constantinople, where he might
seem to have been forgotten in his retreat. The peaceful succession of
Benedict VII, the nephew or grandson of the famous Alberic, may lead to
the conclusion that the faction of that family still survived, and was opposed
to that of Boniface. The first act of Benedict, as might be expected, was the
assembling a council for the excommunication of the murderer and anti-pope
Boniface. This is the first and last important act in the barren annals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587"></a>[587]</span>
Pope Benedict VII. Under the protection of the emperor Otto II, or by
the strength of his Roman faction, he retained peaceful possession of the see
for nine years, an unusual period of quiet. He was succeeded, no doubt
through the influence of the emperor, by John XIV, who was no Roman, but
bishop of Pavia. But in the year of John’s accession (983), Otto II
was preparing a great armament to avenge a terrible defeat by the Saracens.
He had hardly fled from the conquering Saracens, and made his escape from a
Greek ship by leaping into the sea and swimming ashore. He now threatened
with all the forces of the realm to bridge the Straits of Messina, and reunite
Sicily to the empire of the West. In the midst of his preparations he died
at Rome.</p>

<p>The fugitive Boniface Francone had kept up his correspondence with
Rome; he might presume on the unpopularity of a pontiff, if not of German
birth, imposed by foreign influence, and now deprived of his all-powerful protector.
With the same suddenness as before, he reappeared in Rome, seized
the pope, imprisoned him in the castle of St. Angelo, of which important
fortress he had become master, and there put him to death by starvation
or by poison (August 20th, 984). He exposed the body to the view of the
people, who dared not murmur. He seated himself, as it seems, unresisted,
in the papal chair. The holy see was speedily delivered from this murderous
usurper. He died suddenly. The people revenged themselves for their
own base acquiescence in his usurpation by cowardly insults on his dead
body; it was dragged through the streets, and at length buried, either by the
compassion or the attachment (for Boniface must have had a powerful faction
in Rome) of certain ecclesiastics. These bloody revolutions could not but
destroy all reverence for their ecclesiastical rulers in the people of Rome.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2g"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2g">g</a></span></p>

<h5>CHARLES KINGSLEY ON TEMPORAL POWER</h5>

<p>A united Italy suited the views of the popes then no more than it does
now. Not only did they conceive of Rome as still the centre of the western
world, but more, their stock in trade was at Rome. The chains of St. Peter,
the sepulchres of St. Peter and St. Paul, the catacombs filled with the bones
of innumerable martyrs&mdash;these were their stock in trade. By giving these,
selling these, working miracles with these, calling pilgrims from all parts of
Christendom to visit these <i>in situ</i>, they kept up their power and their
wealth.</p>

<p>Having obtained what they wanted from Pepin and Charlemagne, it was
still their interest to pursue the same policy; to compound for their own independence,
as they did with Charlemagne and his successors, by defending the
pretences of foreign kings to the sovereignty of the rest of Italy. This has
been their policy for centuries. It is their policy still; and that policy
has been the curse of Italy. This fatal gift of the patrimony of St. Peter&mdash;as
Dante saw, as Machiavelli saw, as all clear-sighted Italians have seen&mdash;has
kept her divided, torn by civil wars, conquered and reconquered by foreign
invaders. Unable, as a celibate ecclesiastic, to form his dominions into a
strong hereditary kingdom; unable as the hierophant of a priestly caste to
unite his people in the bonds of national life; unable, as Borgia tried to do,
to conquer the rest of Italy for himself, and form it into a kingdom large
enough to have weight in the balance of power, the pope was forced, again and
again, to keep himself on his throne by intriguing with foreign princes,
and calling in foreign arms; and the bane of Italy, from the time of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588"></a>[588]</span>
Stephen III to that of Pius IX, was the temporal power of the pope. But on
the popes, also, the Nemesis came. In building their power on the Roman
relics, on the fable that Rome was the patrimony of Peter, they had built on
a lie; and that lie avenged itself.</p>

<p>Having committed themselves to the false position of being petty kings
of a petty kingdom, they had to endure continual treachery and tyranny
from their foreign allies&mdash;to see not merely Italy, but Rome itself, insulted
and even sacked by faithful Catholics, and to become more and more, as
the centuries rolled on, the tools of those very kings whom they had wished
to make their tools.</p>

<p>True, they defended themselves long, and with astonishing skill and
courage. Their sources of power were two, the moral and the thaumaturgic,
and they used them both; but when the former failed, the latter became useless.
As long as their moral power was real; as long as they and their clergy
were on the whole, in spite of enormous faults, the best men in Europe,
so long the people believed in them, and in their thaumaturgic relics likewise.
But they became by no means the best men in Europe. Then they began to
think that after all it was more easy to work the material than the moral
power&mdash;easier to work the bones than to work righteousness. They were
deceived. Behold! when the righteousness was gone, the bones refused to
work. People began to question the virtue of the bones, and to ask, “We
can believe that the bones may have worked miracles for good men, but for
bad men? We will examine whether they work any miracles at all.” And
then, behold, it came out that the bones did not work miracles, and that
possibly they were not saints’ bones at all; and then the storm came; and
the lie, as all lies do, punished itself. That salt had lost its savour. They
who had been the light of Europe, became its darkness; they who had been
first, became last; a warning to mankind until the end of time, that on truth
and virtue depends the only abiding strength.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_2h"><a href="#papacy_endnote_2h">h</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PAPACY_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III. THE HIGH NOON OF THE PAPACY</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[985-1305 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>During the minority of Otto III the Tuscan party exercised undisputed
sway in Rome, without any check from without. No sooner was Otto II
dead than Boniface VII reappeared from exile, and having seized his rival
John XIV, and put him to death by starvation, for two years occupied unresisted
the papal chair. Nevertheless Boniface VII was not a friend of the
Tuscan party. By the people his dead body was treated with insults.
Boniface’s successor, John XV, not proving as pliant as Crescentius the
consul desired, was driven from Rome and reduced to the necessity of again
appealing to the imperial authority. He was permitted to return.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3b1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3b">b</a></span></p>

<p>At his death, Otto III obliged the clergy and the people to elect his nephew
Bruno, a German, and only twenty years of age. But the chief control of
the city was at present in the hands of the senator Crescentius (Cencius),
a man whom the emperor could not fail to view with feelings of fear and
jealousy. On visiting Rome, therefore, for the purpose of receiving consecration,
he undertook measures for his expulsion; but was prevented from
putting them in practice by the persuasions of his nephew, who had assumed
the appellation of Gregory V. The clemency of the pontiff was ill rewarded.
Crescentius, on the departure of the emperor, drove him from the city and
bestowed the pontifical dignity on a Greek, who took the name of John XVI.
Gregory in the meantime fled into Lombardy; and, having summoned the
several bishops to meet him at Pavia, he there excommunicated both Crescentius
and John, his sentence, it is said, being supported by nearly all Italy,
Germany, and France. The emperor, on his part, lost no time in proceeding
to the capital, where his appearance struck instant terror into the hearts of
the guilty Romans. John was apprehended when on the point of leaving the
city; and the officers of the emperor, dreading lest their master should show
any forbearance towards the culprit, immediately tore out his tongue and his
eyes. Crescentius suffered the gentler punishment of decapitation; and
Gregory, thus freed from his enemies, retained the papal dignity till the
year 999. He was succeeded by Gerbert, archbishop of Ravenna, whom
Otto caused to be elected in gratitude for the services he had rendered him
as his instructor.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3c1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3c">c</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590"></a>[590]</span></p>

<h5>THE DREAM OF OTTO III</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[999-1046 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The emperor was victorious, and exercised undisputed sway in the city
of the cæsars. At this moment a grand scheme rose before his mental
vision. Rome was to occupy again her ancient place as the seat of empire.
An emperor was to sit on the throne of Constantine who would govern like
Constantine, and raise the empire once more to the pinnacle of power. A
truly apostolic pope was to be appointed, a second Silvester who would reform
the clergy and correct the infamous avarice and vice of the Roman church.</p>

<p>On the death of Gregory V that scheme seemed about to be realised.
The decree issued by Otto III for the election of his tutor Gerbert, who
assumed the name of Silvester II, in allusion to the relations of Constantine
and Silvester I, declared Rome to be the capital of the world, the Roman
church to be the mother of churches; it described how the dignity of the
Roman church had been obscured by her neglectful popes, how the property
of the church had been squandered on the dregs of mankind, how the prelates
had made everything venal, and so despoiled the very altars of the
apostles. It denounced the donations of Constantine and Charles the Bald
as void and forgeries; it assumed the power not only of electing, but, by
God’s grace, of creating and ordaining the pope, and it granted eight counties
for his support. The millennial period of the Christian era was to see all
old abuses swept away, and the new régime established. The new age was
to begin with a new Constantine and a new Silvester. The year 1000 was
to inaugurate the change. But how vain are the schemes of men! The
looked-for year came. It found Otto III indeed at Rome, with a palace built
on the Aventine, with a regular administrative system for the government
of the capital established. It found his tutor, Silvester II, on the chair of
St. Peter to second and direct him. Before three years both of them were
dead.</p>

<p>The death of Otto put an end to all attempts at reform. For none but
Otto in that lawless age rose above his surroundings, to project a new era
of improvement. None but his tutor, Silvester II, could sympathise with
his projects. When, comet-like, these two luminaries had darted across the
heaven and disappeared, the darkness of night grew thicker than before.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3b2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3b">b</a></span></p>

<p>With the disappearance of these two eminent men the popedom relapsed
into its former degradation. The feudal nobility&mdash;that very “refuse”
which, to use the expression of a contemporary writer, it had been Otto’s
mission “to sweep from the capital”&mdash;regained their ascendency, and the
popes became as completely the instruments of their will as they had once
been of that of the Eastern emperor. A leading faction among this nobility
was that of the counts of Tusculum, and for nearly half a century the popedom
was a mere appanage in their family. As if to mark their contempt for
the office, they carried the election of Theophylact, the son of Count Alberic,
a lad scarcely twelve years of age, to the office. Benedict IX (1033-1045),
such was the title given him, soon threw off even the external decencies of
his office, and his pontificate was disgraced by every conceivable excess. As
he grew to manhood his rule, in conjunction with that of his brother, who
was appointed the patrician or prefect of the city, resembled that of two captains
of banditti. The scandal attaching to his administration culminated
when it was known that, in order to win the hand of a lady for whom he
had conceived a passion, he had sold the pontifical office itself to another
member of the Tusculan house, John, the arch-presbyter, who took the name
of Gregory VI (1045-1046). His brief pontificate was chiefly occupied with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591"></a>[591]</span>
endeavours to protect the pilgrims to Rome on their way to the capital from
the lawless freebooters (who plundered them of their costly votive offerings
as well as of their personal property), and with attempts to recover by main
force the alienated possessions of the Roman church. Prior, however, to his
purchase of the pontifical office, the citizens of Rome, weary of the tyranny
and extortions of Benedict, had assembled of their own accord and elected
another pope, John, bishop of Sabina, who took the name of Silvester III
(rival pope, 1044-1046).</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1044-1054 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the meantime Benedict had been brought back to Rome by his powerful
kinsmen, and now reclaimed the sacred office. For a brief period,
therefore, there were to be seen three rival popes, each denouncing the other’s
pretensions and combating them by armed force. But even in Rome the
sense of decency and shame had not become altogether extinguished; and at
length a party in the Roman church deputed Peter, their archdeacon, to
carry a petition to the emperor Henry III, soliciting his intervention. The
emperor, a man of deep religious feeling and lofty character, responded to the
appeal. He had long noted, in common with other thoughtful observers,
the widespread degeneracy which, taking example by the curia, was growing
throughout the church at large, and especially visible in concubinage and
simony, alike regarded as mortal sins in the clergy. He forthwith crossed
the Alps and assembled a council at Sutri. The claims of the three rival
popes were each in turn examined and pronounced invalid, and a German,
Suidger (Suidgar or Suger), bishop of Bamberg, was elected to the office as
Clement II (1046-1047).</p>

<h5>THE GERMAN POPES</h5>

<p>The degeneracy of the church at this period would seem to have been in
some degree compensated by the reform of the monasteries, and from the
great abbey of Cluny in Burgundy there now proceeded a line of German
popes who in a great measure restored the dignity and reputation of their
office. But, whether from the climate, always ill adapted to the German
constitution, or from poison, as the contemporary chronicles not unfrequently
suggest, it is certain that their tenure of office was singularly brief. Clement
II died before the close of the year of his election. Damasus II, his successor,
held the office only twenty-three days. Leo IX, who succeeded, held it
for the exceptionally lengthened period of more than five years (1049-1054).
This pontiff, although a kinsman and nominee of the emperor, refused to
ascend the throne until his election had been ratified by the voice of the
clergy and the people, and his administration of the office presented the greatest
possible contrast to that of Benedict IX or Sergius III.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1049-1064 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In more than one respect it constitutes a crisis in the history of the popedom.
In conjunction with his faithful friend and adviser, the great Hildebrand,
he projected schemes of fundamental church reform, in which the
suppression of simony and of married life (or concubinage, as it was styled
by its denouncers) on the part of the clergy formed the leading features.
In the year 1049, at three great synods successively convened at Rome,
Rheims, and Mainz, new canons condemnatory of the prevailing abuses were
enacted, and the principles of monasticism more distinctly asserted in contravention
of those traditional among the secular clergy. Leo’s pontificate
closed, however, ingloriously.</p>

<p>In an evil hour he ventured to oppose the occupation by the Normans,
whose encroachments on Italy were just commencing. His ill-disciplined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592"></a>[592]</span>
forces were no match for the Norman bands, composed of the best warriors
of the age. He was himself made prisoner, detained for nearly a twelvemonth
in captivity, and eventually released only to die, a few days after, of
grief and humiliation. But, although his own career terminated thus ignominiously,
the services rendered by Leo to the cause of Roman Catholicism
were great and permanent; and of his different measures none contributed
more effectually to the stability of his see than the formation of the college
of cardinals.</p>

<h5>THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS</h5>

<p>The title of “cardinal” was not originally restricted to dignitaries
connected with the church of Rome, but it had hitherto been a canonical
requirement that all who attained to this dignity should have passed
through the successive lower ecclesiastical grades in connection with one and
the same foundation; the cardinals attached to the Roman church had consequently
been all Italians, educated for the most part in the capital, having
but little experience of the world beyond its walls, and incapable of estimating
church questions in the light of the necessities and feelings of Christendom
at large. By the change which he introduced, Leo summoned the
leaders of the party of reform within the newly constituted college of cardinals,
and thus attached to his office a body of able advisers with wider views
and less narrow sympathies. By their aid the administration of the pontifical
duties was rendered at once more easy and more effective.</p>

<p>The pontiff himself was liberated from his bondage to the capital, and,
even when driven from Rome, could still watch over the interests of both his
see and the entire church in all their extended relations; and the popedom
must now be looked upon as entering upon another stage in its history&mdash;that
of almost uninterrupted progress to the pinnacle of power. According
to Anselm<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3o"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3o">o</a></span> of Lucca, it was during the pontificate of Leo, at the synod of
Rheims above referred to, that the title of “apostolic bishop” (<i>apostolicus</i>)
was first declared to belong to the pope of Rome exclusively.</p>

<p>The short pontificate of Nicholas II (1059-1061) is memorable chiefly for
the fundamental change then introduced in the method of electing to the
papal office. By a decree of the Second Lateran Council (1059), the nomination
to the office was vested solely in the cardinal bishops&mdash;the lower clergy,
the citizens, and the emperor retaining simply the right of intimating or withholding
their assent. It was likewise enacted that the nominee should always
be one of the Roman clergy, unless indeed no eligible person could be found
among their number. At the same time the direst anathemas were decreed
against all who should venture to infringe this enactment either in the letter
or the spirit.</p>

<p>The preponderance thus secured to the ultramontane party and to Italian
interests must be regarded as materially affecting the whole subsequent history
of the popedom. The manner in which it struck at the imperial influence
was soon made apparent in the choice of Nicholas’ successor, the line of
German popes being broken through by the election of Anselm, bishop of
Lucca (the uncle of the historian), who ascended the pontifical throne as Alexander
II (1061-1073) without having received the sanction of the emperor.
His election was forthwith challenged by the latter, and for the space of two
years the Roman state was distracted by a civil war, Honorius II being supported
as a rival candidate by the imperial arms, while Alexander maintained
his position only with the support of the Norman levies. The respective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593"></a>[593]</span>
merits of their claims were considered at a council convened at Mantua, and
the decision was given in favour of Alexander. Cadalous, such was the name
of his rival, did not acknowledge the justice of the sentence, but he retired
into obscurity; and the remainder of Alexander’s pontificate, though troubled
by the disputes respecting a married clergy, was free from actual warfare. In
these much vexed questions of church discipline Alexander, who had been
mainly indebted for his election to Hildebrand, the archdeacon of the Roman
church, was guided entirely by that able churchman’s advice, and in 1073
Hildebrand himself succeeded to the office as Gregory VII (1073-1085).<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3d1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3d">d</a></span></p>

<h5>MILMAN ON THE MISSION OF THE PAPACY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1064-1073 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Hildebrand was now pope; the great contest for the dominion over the
human mind, the strife between the temporal and spiritual power, which had
been carried on for some centuries as a desultory and intermitting warfare,
was now to be waged boldly, openly, implacably, to the subjugation of one
or of the other. Sacerdotal, or rather papal Christianity, had not yet fulfilled
its mission, for, the papal control withdrawn, the sacerdotal rule would
have lost its unity, and with its unity its authority must have dissolved
away. Without the clergy, not working here and there with irregular and
uncombined excitement on the religious feelings of man, awakening in one
quarter a vigorous enthusiasm, while in other parts of Europe men were left
to fall back into some new Christian heathenism, or into an inert habitual
Christianity of form; without the whole order labouring on a fixed and
determined system, through creeds sanctified by ancient reverence and a
ceremonial guarded by rigid usage; without this vast uniform, hierarchical
influence, where, in those ages of anarchy and ignorance, of brute force and
dormant intelligence, had been Christianity itself? And looking only to its
temporal condition, what had the world been without Christianity?</p>

<p>The papacy has still the more splendid part of its destiny to accomplish.
It has shown vital power enough to recover from its seemingly irrecoverable
degradation. It might have been supposed that a moral and religious deprivation
so profound, would utterly have destroyed that reverence of opinion
which was the one groundwork of the papal power. The veil had been
raised; and Italy at least, if not Europe, had seen within it, not a reflex of
divine majesty and holiness, but an idol not only hideous to the pure moral
sentiment, but contemptible for its weakness. If centuries of sanctity had
planted deeply in the heart of man his veneration for the successor of St.
Peter, it would have been paralysed (the world might expect) and extinguished
by more than a century of odious and unchristian vices. A spiritual
succession must be broken and interrupted by such unspiritual inheritors.
Could the head of Christendom, living in the most unchristian wickedness,
perpetuate his descent, and hand down the patrimony of power and authority,
with nothing of that piety and goodness which was at least one of his
titles to that transcendent power?</p>

<p>But that idea or that opinion would not have endured for centuries, had
it not possessed strength enough to reconcile its believers to contradictions
and inconsistencies. With all the Teutonic part of Latin Christendom, the
belief in the supremacy of the pope was coeval with their Christianity; it
was an article of their original creed as much as the redemption; their
apostles were commissioned by the pope; to him they humbly looked for
instruction and encouragement, even almost for permission to advance upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594"></a>[594]</span>
their sacred adventure. Augustine, Boniface, Ebbo, Anskar, had been papal
missionaries. If the faith of Italy was shaken by too familiar a view
of that which the Germans contemplated with more remote and indistinct
veneration, the national pride, in Rome especially, accepted the spiritual as
a compensation for the loss of the temporal supremacy; it had ceased to be
the centre of the imperial, it would not endure not to be that of ecclesiastical
dominion. The jealousy of a pope elected, or even born, elsewhere
than in Italy, showed the vitality of that belief in the papacy, which was
belied by so many acts of violence towards individual popes.</p>

<p>The religious minds would be chiefly offended by the incongruity between
the lives and the station of the pope; but to them it would be a part
of religion to suppress any rebellious doubts. Their souls were deeply impressed
with the paramount necessity of the unity of the church; to them
the papacy was of divine appointment, the pope the successor of St. Peter;
all secret questioning of this integral part of their implanted faith was sin.
However then they might bow down in shame and sorrow at the inscrutable
decrees of heaven, in allowing its vicegerent
thus to depart from his original brightness,
yet they would veil their faces in awe, and
await in trembling patience the solution of
that mystery. In the Christian mind in
general, or rather the mind within the world
of Christendom, the separation between
Christian faith and Christian morality was
almost complete. Christianity was a mere
unreasoning assent to certain dogmatic
truths, an unreasoning obedience to certain
ceremonial observances.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Pope of the Eleventh Century</span></p>
<p class="caption">(Based on an effigy)</p>
</div>

<p>Controversy was almost dead. In the
former century, the predestinarian doctrines
of Gottschalk, in general so acceptable to
the popular ear, had been entirely suppressed
by the sacerdotal authority. The tenets of
Berengar concerning the presence of Christ
in the Sacrament, had been restrained, and
were to be once more restrained, by the
same strong hand; and Berengar’s logic
was beyond his age. The Manichæan doctrines
of the Paulicians and kindred sects
were doubtless spreading to a great extent
among the lower orders, but as yet in secrecy,
breaking out now in one place, now in another,
yet everywhere beheld with abhorrence,
creating no wide alarm, threatening
no dangerous disunion. In all the vulgar of
Christendom (and that vulgar comprehended
all orders, all ranks) the moral sentiment, as
more obtuse, would be less shocked by that
incongruity which grieved and oppressed the more religious. The great
body of Christians in the West would no more have thought of discussing
the character of the pope than the attributes of God. He was to them the
apostle, the vicegerent of God, enveloped in the same kind of awful mystery.
They feared the thunders of the Lateran as those of heaven; and were no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595"></a>[595]</span>
more capable of sound discrimination as to the limits, grounds, and nature
of that authority than as to the causes of the destructive fire from the clouds.
Their general belief in the judgment to come was not more deeply rooted
than in the right of the clergy, more especially the head of the clergy, to
anticipate, to declare, or to ratify their doom.</p>

<p>The German line of pontiffs had done much to reinvest the papacy in its
ancient sanctity. The Italian Alexander II had been at least a blameless
pontiff, and now every qualification which could array the pope in imposing
majesty, in what bordered on divine worship, seemed to meet in Gregory
VII. His life verified the splendid panegyric with which he had been presented
by Cardinal Hugo to the Roman people. He had the austerest virtue,
the most simple piety, the fame of vast theologic knowledge, the tried ability
to rule men, intrepidity which seemed to delight in confronting the most
powerful; a stern singleness of purpose, which, under its name of churchmanship,
gave his partisans unlimited reliance on his firmness and resolution,
and yet a subtle policy which bordered upon craft. To them his faults were
virtues; his imperiousness the due assertion of his dignity; his unbounded
ambition zeal in God’s cause; no haughtiness could be above that
which became his station. The terror by which he ruled (he was so powerful
that he could dispense with love), as it was the attribute of the divinity now
exclusively worshipped by man, so was it that which became the representative
of God on earth.</p>

<p>The first, the avowed object of Gregory’s pontificate, was the absolute
independence of the clergy, of the pope, of the great prelates throughout
Latin Christendom, down to the lowest functionary, whose person was to
become sacred; that independence under which lurked the undisguised
pretension to superiority. His remote and somewhat more indistinct vision
was the foundation of a vast spiritual autocracy in the person of the pope,
who was to rule mankind by the consentient but subordinate authority of
the clergy throughout the world. For this end the clergy were to become
still more completely a separate, inviolable caste; their property equally
sacred with their persons. Each in his separate sphere, the pope above all
and comprehending all, was to be sovereign arbiter of all disputes; to hold
in his hands the supreme mediation in questions of war and peace; to adjudge
contested successions to kingdoms; to be a great feudal lord, to whom other
kings became beneficiaries. His own arms were to be chiefly spiritual,
but the temporal power was to be always ready to execute the ecclesiastical
behest against the ungodly rebels who might revolt from its authority; nor
did the churchman refuse altogether to sanction the employment of secular
weapons, to employ armies in his own name, or even to permit the use of arms
to the priesthood.</p>

<p>For this complete isolation of the hierarchy into a peculiar and inviolable
caste was first necessary the reformation of the clergy in two most important
preliminary matters; the absolute extirpation of the two evils, which the
more rigid churchmen had been denouncing for centuries, to the suppression
of which Hildebrand had devoted so much of his active energies. The war
against simony and the concubinage of the clergy (for under this ill-sounding
name was condemned all connection, however legalised, with the female
sex), must first be carried to a triumphant issue, before the church could
assume its full and uncontested domination.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596"></a>[596]</span></p>

<h5><i>Simony</i></h5>

<p>Like his predecessors, like all the more high-minded churchmen, Hildebrand
refused to see that simony was the inevitable consequence of the
inordinate wealth of the clergy. It was a wild moral paradox to attempt
to reconcile enormous temporal possessions and enormous temporal power
with the extinction of all temporal motives for obtaining, all temptations to
the misuse of these all-envied treasures. In the feudal system, which had
been so long growing up throughout western Europe, bishops had become, in
every respect, the equals of the secular nobles. In every city the bishop, if
not the very first of men, was on a level with the first; without the city he
was lord of the amplest domains. Archbishops almost equalled kings; for
who would not have coveted the station and authority of a Hincmar, archbishop
of Rheims, rather than the sovereignty of the feeble Carlovingian
monarch?</p>

<p>Charlemagne himself had set the example of advancing his natural sons
to high ecclesiastical dignities. His feebler descendants, even the more
pious, submitted to the same course from choice or necessity. The evil
worked downwards. The bishop, who had bought his see, indemnified himself
by selling the inferior prebends or cures. What was so intrinsically
valuable began to have its money-price; it became an object of barter and
sale. The layman who purchased holy orders bought usually peace, security
of life, comparative ease. Those who aspired to higher dignities soon repaid
themselves for the outlay, however large and extortionate. The highest
bishops confessed their own guilt; the bishopric of Rome had too often been
notoriously bought and sold.</p>

<p>According to the strict law, the clergy could receive everything, alienate
nothing. But the frequent and bitter complaints of the violent usurpation, or
the fraudulent alienation by the clergy themselves of what had been church
property, show that neither party respected this sanctity when it was the
interest of both to violate it. While, on the one hand, the clergy extorted
from the dying prince or noble some important grant, immunity, or possession,
the despoiled heir would scruple at no means of resuming his alienated
rights or property. The careless, the profligate, the venal, the warlike
bishop or abbot, would find means, if he found advantage, to elude the law;
to surrender gradually and imperceptibly; to lease out the land so as to
annihilate its value to the church; to grant in perpetuity for trifling
compensations or for valueless service the coveted estate; and so to relax the
inexorable grasp of the church. His own pomp and expenditure would reduce
the ecclesiastic to the wants and subterfuges of debtors and of bankrupts;
and so the estates would, directly or circuitously, return either to
the original or to some new owner.</p>

<h5><i>Celibacy of the Clergy</i></h5>

<p>With this universal simony was connected, more closely than may at
first appear, the other great vice of the age, as it was esteemed by Hildebrand
and his school, the marriage of the clergy. The celibacy of the clergy was
necessary to their existence, at the present period, as a separate caste. Hereditary
succession and the degeneracy of the order were inseparable. Great
as were the evils inevitable from the dominion of the priesthood, if it had
become in any degree the privilege of certain families, that evil would have
been enormously aggravated, the compensating advantages annulled. Family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_597"></a>[597]</span>
affections and interests would have been constantly struggling against those
of the church. One universal nepotism, a nepotism not of kindred but of
parentage, would have preyed upon the vital energies of the order. Every
irreligious occupant would either have endeavoured to alienate to his lay descendants
the property of the church, or bred up his still more degenerate
descendants in the certainty of succession to their patrimonial benefice.</p>

<p>Celibacy may be maintained for a time by mutual control and awe; by
severe discipline; by a strong corporate spirit in a monastic community.
But in a low state of morals as to sexual intercourse, in an order recruited
from all classes of society, not filled by men of tried and matured religion;
in an order crowded by aspirants after its wealth, power, comparative ease,
privileges, immunities, public estimation; in an order superior to, or dictating
public opinion (if public opinion made itself heard); in a permanent
order, in which the degeneracy of one age would go on increasing in the
next, till it produced some stern reaction; in an order comparatively idle,
without social duties or intellectual pursuits; in an order not secluded in
the desert, but officially brought into the closest and most confidential relations
as instructors and advisers of the other sex, it was impossible to maintain
real celibacy; and the practical alternative lay between secret marriage,
concubinage without the form of marriage, or a looser and more corrupting
intercourse between the sexes.</p>

<p>Throughout Latin Christendom, throughout the whole spiritual realm of
Hildebrand, he could not but know there had been long a deep murmured,
if not an avowed doubt, as to the authority of the prohibitions against the
marriage of the clergy; where the dogmatic authority of the papal canons
was not called in question, there was a bold resistance or a tacit infringement
of the law. Italy has been seen in actual, if uncombined, rebellion
from Calabria to the Alps. The whole clergy of the kingdom of Naples has
appeared, under Nicholas II, from the highest to the lowest, openly living
with their lawful wives. The married clergy were still, if for the present
cowed, a powerful faction throughout Italy; they were awaiting their time
of vengeance. The memory of the married pope, Adrian II, was but recent.</p>

<p>In Germany the power and influence of the married clergy will make
itself felt, if less openly proclaimed, as a bond of alliance with the emperor
and the Lombard prelates. The French councils denounce the crime as
frequent, notorious. Among the Anglo-Saxon clergy before Dunstan, marriage
was rather the rule, celibacy the exception.</p>

<h5>GREGORY’S SYNOD AT ROME</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1073-1074 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Almost the first public act of Gregory VII was a declaration of implacable
war against these his two mortal enemies, simony and the marriage of
the clergy. He was no infant Hercules; but the mature ecclesiastical
Hercules would begin his career by strangling these two serpents&mdash;the
brood, as he esteemed them, and parents of all evil. The decree of the
synod held in Rome (March 9th, 10th, 1074) in the eleventh month of his
pontificate is not extant, but in its inexorable provisions it went beyond the
sternest of his predecessors. It absolutely invalidated all sacraments performed
by simoniacal or married priests; baptism was no regenerating rite;
it might almost seem that the eucharistic bread and wine in their unhallowed
hands refused to be transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ.
The communicants guilty of perseverance at least in the sin shared in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598"></a>[598]</span>
sacerdotal guilt. Even the priesthood was startled at this new and awful
doctrine, that the efficacy of the sacraments depended on their own sinlessness.
Gregory, in his headstrong zeal, was promulgating a doctrine used
afterwards by Wycliffe and his followers with such tremendous energy.
And this was a fearless, democratical provocation to the people; for it left
to notoriety, to public fame, to fix on anyone the brand of the hidden sin
of simony, or (it might be the calumnious) charge of concubinage; and so
abandoned the holy priesthood to the judgment of the multitude.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>But the extirpation of these two internal enemies to the dignity and the
power of the sacerdotal order was far below the holy ambition of Gregory;
this was but clearing the ground for the stately fabric of his theocracy. If,
for his own purposes, he had at first assumed some moderation in his intercourse
with the empire, over the rest of Latin Christendom he took at once
the tone and language of a sovereign. We must rapidly survey, before we
follow him into his great war with the empire, Gregory VII asserting his
autocracy over the rest of Latin Christendom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1074-1076 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>His letters to Philip I, king of France, are in the haughtiest, most
criminatory terms: “No king has reached such a height of detestable guilt
in oppressing the churches of his kingdom as Philip of France.” He puts
the king to the test; his immediate admission of a bishop of Mâcon, elected
by the clergy and people, without payment to the crown. Either let the
king repudiate this base traffic of simony, and allow fit persons to be
promoted to bishoprics, or the Franks, unless apostates from Christianity,
will be struck with the sword of excommunication, and refuse any longer to
obey him.</p>

<p>Hildebrand’s predecessor (and Alexander II did no momentous act without
the counsel of Hildebrand) had given a direct sanction to the Norman
conquest of England. Hildebrand may have felt some admiration, even
awe, of the congenial mind of the conqueror. He advances the claim to
Peter’s pence over the kingdom. William admits this claim; it was among
the stipulations, it was the price which the pope had imposed for his assent to
the conquest. But to the demand of fealty, the conqueror returns an answer of
haughty brevity: “I have not sworn, nor will I swear fealty which was never
sworn by any of my predecessors to yours.” And William maintained his
Teutonic independence&mdash;created bishops and abbots at his will, was absolute
lord over his ecclesiastical as over his feudal liegemen.</p>

<p>To the kings of Spain, in one of his earliest letters, Pope Gregory boldly
asserts that the whole realm of Spain is not only within the spiritual jurisdiction
of the holy see, but her property. No part of Latin Christendom
was so remote or so barbarous as to escape his vigilant determination to bring
it under his vast ecclesiastical unity. While yet a deacon he had corresponded
with Sweyn, king of Denmark; on him he bestows much grave and
excellent advice. In a letter to Olaf, king of Norway, he dissuades him
solemnly from assisting the rebellious brothers of the Danish king. Between
the duke of Poland and the king of the Russians he interposes his mediation.
The son of the Russian had come to Rome to receive his kingdom from the
hands of St. Peter. The kingdom of Hungary, as that of Spain, he treats as
a fief of the papacy; he rebukes the king Solomon for daring to hold it as a
benefice of the king of the Germans. He watches over Bohemia; his legates
take under their care the estates of the church; he summons the archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_599"></a>[599]</span>
of Prague to Rome. Even Africa is not beyond the care of Hildebrand.
The clergy and people of Carthage are urged to adhere to their archbishop&mdash;not
to dread the arms of the Saracens, though that once flourishing Christian
province, the land of Cyprian and Augustine, is so utterly reduced that three
bishops cannot be found to proceed to a legitimate consecration.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bishop of the Eleventh Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>But the empire was the one worthy, one formidable antagonist to Hildebrand’s
universal theocracy, whose prostration would lay the world beneath
his feet. The empire must acknowledge itself as a grant from the papacy,
as a grant revocable for certain offences against the ecclesiastical rights and
immunities; it must humbly acquiesce in the uncontrolled prerogative of the
cardinals to elect the pope; abandon all the
imperial claims on the investiture of the prelates
and other clergy with their benefices; release
the whole mass of church property from all
feudal demands, whether of service or of fealty;
submit patiently to rebuke; admit the pope to
dictate on questions of war and peace, and all
internal government where he might detect, or
suppose that he detected, oppression. This was
the condition to which the words and acts of
Gregory aspired to reduce the heirs of Charlemagne,
the successors of the western cæsars.</p>

<p>As a Christian, as a member of the church,
the emperor was confessedly subordinate to the
pope, the acknowledged head and ruler of the
church. As a subject of the empire, the pope
owed temporal allegiance to the emperor. The
authority of each depended on loose and flexible
tradition, on variable and contradictory precedents,
on titles of uncertain signification; each
could ascend to a time when they were not
dependent upon each other. The emperor
boasted himself the successor to the whole
autocracy of the cæsars, to Augustus, Constantine,
Charlemagne: the pope to that of St. Peter,
or of Christ himself.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3e1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3e">e</a></span> But all-powerful as was
the pope abroad, in Italy his authority was
restricted. Even in Rome the prefect Cencius
dared to lay hands on Gregory VII, to tear
him from the sanctuary of a church during a
riot, and afterwards held him some time a
prisoner. At Milan the citizens expelled Herlembald and his tool Atto,
who exercised actual tyranny in the city under pretext of carrying out the
pope’s reforms, and demanded an archbishop of Henry IV, who sent them a
noble from Castiglione. This was the commencement of the struggle between
sacerdotal and imperial power that culminated in one of the greatest
and most stirring dramas of all history.</p>

<p>Events began auspiciously for Gregory, many points of support being
promised him in Germany. Feudal rebellions had kept that country in a
state of agitation during the minority of Henry IV, who was but six years
old when his father died in 1056. The regency and even the person of the
young king had been wrested from the empress Agnes by the dukes of
Saxony and Bavaria. Once arrived at man’s estate, Henry IV set about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600"></a>[600]</span>
suppressing the revolt that had, as usual, arisen among the Saxons. An
important victory won in Thuringia seemed to promise him a continuance of
success, when suddenly the voice of the pope thundered down upon him, ordering
him, with unexampled audacity, to suspend all warlike operations, and to
leave to the holy see the right of decision in his quarrel with the Saxons;
furthermore, to abandon all pretensions to ecclesiastical investiture, under
pain of excommunication. To this the legates joined the summons to appear
at Rome to answer certain personal charges that had been brought against
him. Henry IV replied to this furious attack with equal vigour, and in
the synod of Worms, composed of eighteen prelates, his partisans, he caused
sentence of deposition solemnly to be pronounced against Gregory VII
(1076).</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1076-1077 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This decree, instead of alarming the pope, but excited him to fresh
aggression. No sooner was he delivered by a popular movement from the
hands of his enemy, Cencius, the Roman prefect, than he began once more to
thunder forth denunciations; he hurled a bull of excommunication at the
emperor, in which he proclaimed him a rebel to the holy see, and declared
his vassals free from all allegiance to him. This bull was mercilessly put
into execution by the Saxons and Swabians, all enemies of the house of
Franconia. At their head was Rudolf of Swabia and the Italian, Welf, of
the house of Este, whom Henry himself had created duke of Bavaria. They
convoked a diet at Tribur, suspended the functions of the emperor and menaced
him with deposition if he did not win absolution from the curse of
Rome. Henry acceded humbly, and promised to assemble a general diet at
Augsburg, which he begged the pope to attend for the purpose of absolving
him. Alive, however, to the danger of allowing his enemies to come together
in a body, he resolved to anticipate the action of the proposed diet and went
himself to Italy to implore pardon of the pope.</p>

<p>The price Gregory set upon this absolution was such as no other monarch
ever had to pay. The pope was inhabiting at the time the château of Canossa,
in the domains of the celebrated countess Matilda, a devout adherent of
the holy see and the most powerful sovereign in Italy, since she included
among her possessions the marquisates of Tuscany and Spoleto, Parma, Piacenza,
and several points in Lombardy, the Marches, etc. Henry IV came to
this castle to solicit an audience, but was compelled to wait barefooted in the
snow three days before he was received. At last on the fourth day he was
admitted and given absolution. Gregory, however, too adroit to lay down
arms at once, refused to decide the question relative to the German crown,
and deferred all consideration of it to a special diet, thereby reserving to
himself a means of throwing Henry into fresh embarrassment. Could the
king do other than tremble before a man who was the acknowledged representative
of divinity on earth, and who believed himself so secure in the
favour of heaven that, taking half of a “host,” he adjured God upon it to
annihilate him instantly if he were guilty of the crimes imputed to him?
When he presented the second half of the “host” to the king, asking him
to swear a similar oath, Henry shrank back affrighted (1077).</p>

<p>By this timely bowing of the head Henry IV avoided the blow that was
about to be aimed at him by a coalition of his enemies; the moment of danger
once passed, he straightened up like a bow relieved from tension. Indeed
he had no alternative save definitively to relinquish his hopes of the
crown or again to risk all upon a single chance, since the German rebels had
undertaken to answer the question left open by Gregory, and had appointed
to the throne Rudolf of Swabia, who had purchased the protection of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601"></a>[601]</span>
legates by promising to abjure investiture (1077), and had been solemnly
acknowledged by the pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1077-1125 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Having gathered around himself a body of partisans, Henry IV began
to wage war with success. The battle of Wolksheim, in which Rudolf was
slain by the hand of Godfrey de Bouillon, duke of Lower Lorraine, who carried
the imperial standard, made him master of Germany (1080). He determined
to repeat this success in Italy, where a victory won by his son had
already paved the way; and the countess Matilda was stripped of a part
of her possessions, Rome was taken, and the archbishop of Ravenna was
appointed pope under the name of Clement III. Gregory himself would
have fallen into the hands of the man he had so deeply outraged, had not
Robert Guiscard and his Normans, faithful allies of the holy see, come to
his rescue. He died among them (1085) with the words: “For no other
reason than that I have loved justice and pursued iniquity, I must die in
exile.”</p>

<p>Up to the final moment he appeared to believe that universal dominance
was an inalienable right of the holy see, and his idea was certainly not
devoid of logic.</p>

<p>Gregory’s death came too soon; had he lived a few years longer he
would have seen his enemy expire in a condition far more miserable than
that in which he had been placed at Canossa. Urban II, made pope in
1088, found his main support in the Normans, and conferred upon Roger,
duke of Sicily, the title of king. He revealed the papacy in all its grandeur
on the occasion of the First Crusade, and revived most of Gregory’s old judgments
against the emperor. After a transitory triumph Henry IV was
successively attacked by his two sons, whom the church had armed against
him, and after having been stripped of all the imperial insignia, was made
prisoner by his younger son. In vain he invoked the succour of the king of
France, who had been his “most faithful friend”; all help was refused him,
and he was reduced to soliciting the post of under-choir-master in a church,
“having a considerable knowledge of music.” He died in 1106 at Liège in
the depths of poverty, calling down the “vengeance of God upon the parricide”;
and his body remained five years without sepulture.</p>

<p>It was, however, this very parricidal son Henry V who at last put a stop
to the quarrels resulting from the vexed question of investitures. The decision
was retarded some time by the opening of the succession of Countess
Matilda, who had bequeathed all her estates to the holy see. Henry laid
claim to the entire inheritance, to the fiefs as sovereign of the empire, to the
allodial lands as the countess’ nearest heir, and succeeded in entering upon
possession of them all. As can readily be believed, this was a cause for fresh
dissension in the future. The opening dispute being provisorily settled, the
two sides, recognising that a struggle would but weaken them while it confirmed
the independence of the feudal lords and of the Italian middle classes,
resolved to close the matter by an equitable and, as nearly as possible, an
equal division of the rights under dispute. The Concordat of Worms (1122)
was couched in the following terms: “I agree,” said Pope Calixtus II to the
emperor, “that the elections of the bishops and abbots of the Teutonic kingdom
shall take place without violence or simony in your presence, so that in
case any difference shall arise you can give your sanction and protection to
the side having greater holiness, according to the judgment of the metropolitan
and the co-provincials. The elect shall receive from you the prerogatives
of his office, and, except that duty that he owes the Roman church,
shall render you obedience in all things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602"></a>[602]</span></p>

<p>“I remit to the pope,” said the king, “all right to confer investiture
by ring and cross, and in the churches of my kingdom and my empire, I
authorise canonical elections and free consecration.” This wise compromise,
which vested the temporal and spiritual power respectively in the temporal
and spiritual rulers, was accompanied by words of reconciliation. But the
design of Gregory VII was not yet fulfilled; the tie of vassalage that united
the clergy to the prince was by no means severed, and church remained a
part of the state in its main portion at least, if not in its outlying members.</p>

<p>The house of Franconia became extinct with Henry V (1125) after
having, by a provisory issue, dissolved the rivalry that existed between the
papacy and the empire. The reign of Lothair II, successor of Henry V,
was like an interlude between two acts of a drama; during the pause the
stage was cleared and reset for the scene that was to follow.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3f"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3f">f</a></span></p>

<h5>BRYCE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CONCORDAT</h5>

<p>The Concordat of Worms was in form a compromise designed to spare
either party the humiliation of defeat. Yet the papacy remained master of
the field. The emperor retained but one-half of those rights of investiture
which had formerly been his. At any moment his sceptre might be shivered
in his hand by the bolt of anathema, and a host of enemies spring up from
every convent and cathedral.</p>

<p>Two other results of this great conflict ought not to pass unnoticed.
The emperor was alienated from the church at the most unfortunate of all
moments, the end of the Crusades. The religious feeling which the
Crusades evoked turned wholly against the opponent of ecclesiastical claims
and was made to work the will of the holy see. A century and a half later
the pope did not scruple to preach a crusade against the emperor himself.</p>

<p>Again, it was now the first seeds were sown of that fear and hatred
wherewith the German people never thenceforth ceased to regard the
encroaching Romish court. Branded by the church and forsaken by the
nobles, Henry IV retained the affections of the faithful burghers of Worms
and Liège. It soon became a test of Teutonic patriotism to resist Italian
priestcraft.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3g1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3g">g</a></span></p>

<h5>RIVAL CLAIMANTS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1119-1155 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>On the death of Paschal (1118), the bishops of Porto, Ostia, and others
elected John of Gaeta, who was chancellor of Rome, to the vacant chair.
But his elevation was strongly opposed by the emperor’s minister, Cenzio
Frangipani, who, following him to the church where the investiture was to
take place, seized him by the throat, and after exposing him to every species
of violence from his attendants, dragged him by the hair of the head to his
house, and there left him chained, to await the orders of the emperor. He
subsequently made his escape to his native place, of which he was made
bishop; and Henry, in the meanwhile, raised Maurice Bourdin, by the name
of Gregory VIII, to the throne.</p>

<p>Gelasius, as John of Gaeta was called, attempted to recover his dignity,
but finding that he could not remain in Italy with safety, fled to Provence,
where he died the following year. The anti-pope Gregory, though the way
was now open for his accession to the throne, gained no advantage by the
death of his rival. Guido, archbishop of Ravenna, a man of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603"></a>[603]</span>
powers of mind and vast influence, ascended the papal chair as Calixtus II.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
The contest which he was obliged to carry on with Gregory ended completely
in his favour; and the defeated pretender died, after suffering innumerable
miseries,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> in a monastery. Calixtus himself died shortly after (1124); and
his successor, Honorius II, passed a reign of five years in fruitless contention
with Roger of Sicily, by whom his troops were entirely defeated. Innocent
II and Anacletus II both pretended to the dignity at his death; and the
former, before he could establish his sole claim to the prize, had to spend
several years as an exile in France.</p>

<p>We pass over the obscure pontificates of his immediate successors. But
in 1145, Bernard, abbot of St. Anastasius at Rome, and a favourite disciple
of the celebrated saint of the same name, was elected to the see as Eugenius
III. But whatever were the virtues of Eugenius, or the credit due to him
from his intimacy with a man so full of wisdom and holiness as St. Bernard,
the factious spirit which had long prevailed at Rome broke out into new excesses
at the period of his elevation. Urged on by the popular eloquence of
Arnold of Brescia, they were suddenly inflamed with the desire of restoring
the institutions and government of the ancient capital; but the tumult which
was commenced with this pretence soon carried its authors to the commission
of every species of violence; and the dazzling vision of Rome, restored to its
consular dignity, was lost in the clouds and thick darkness which rose from
the destruction of some of its finest buildings. Eugenius, by a timely exertion
of energy, quelled these disorders; and his return to Rome was attended
with all the marks of a triumph. The signs, however, of sedition were still
too manifest on the faces of the Romans to allow of his remaining secure
among them, and he retired for some time into France. He came back to
Italy about the year 1153, and died almost immediately after, at his residence
in the town of Tibur.</p>

<h5>ADRIAN IV <i>versus</i> BARBAROSSA</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1155-1158 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The successor of Eugenius was Adrian IV, by birth an Englishman,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
and strongly characterised by all the ruling passions of the dignified clergy
of this age.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Frederick Barbarossa had, in the meanwhile, ascended the
imperial throne, and his pride and ambition were fitting though dangerous
companions for the haughtiness of Adrian. It was not long before an opportunity
was afforded these two distinguished men to try the strength of their
resolution and principles. Frederick, having been crowned king of the
Lombards, hastened towards Rome; but before he arrived at the gate of the
city he was met by three cardinals, who acquainted him that the pontiff could
not hold any conference with a prince from whom he had as yet received no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604"></a>[604]</span>
assurance of obedience and of fidelity to the church. The monarch readily
accorded the required professions of allegiance; and a chevalier appointed
for the purpose swore solemnly in his name, and on the holy relics, the cross
and the Gospel, that he would preserve in safety the life, the liberty, and
honour of both the pope and the cardinals. Adrian then intimated his
readiness to crown him emperor, and was conducted with great pomp
towards the sovereign’s tent.</p>

<p>But here a new cause of contention arose. Frederick had too high a
sense of his imperial dignity to manifest any servile complaisance for papal
pride. Instead, therefore, of hastening, as some other princes had done, to
perform the part of an esquire to the pontiff, he quietly awaited him in his pavilion;
which so offended Adrian, that he positively refused to grant him the
kiss of peace, till he should perform the humiliating ceremonies to which
the pride of churchmen and the pusillanimity of princes had given a
species of legitimacy. A whole day was expended in disputing whether the
emperor should continue the practice or not. But Adrian was inflexible;
and the following morning the haughty Frederick in the presence of his army,
purchased the kiss of peace by standing like a menial at the side of the pope’s
horse, till he descended and freed him from his degrading situation.</p>

<p>A powerful faction at Rome hailed with joy the approach of Frederick.
The desire of limiting the despotism of the pope, and the expectation of
drawing large sums as a largess from the imperial treasury, appear to have
exercised an almost equal influence on their minds at this time. In their
address to Frederick the deputies of this party assumed the station of men
who had an unconquered country to present as a free-will offering to the
valour and noble qualities of the prince they sought. They had, however,
greatly mistaken the ideas of the emperor on the state of Italy. Frederick
told them, and with a sternness which presaged a coming storm, that their
country had been long and often conquered; that he was truly and lawfully
their master. He took possession forthwith of the church of St. Peter
(1155), and Adrian placed the imperial crown on the head of the sovereign
with far greater willingness than he would have done, had he not seen that
his agreement with the prince was now essential to his safety and to the
preservation of the church. The populace, finding themselves set at nought
by both the pope and the emperor, rose in a mass, and several of the German
soldiers fell slaughtered in the aisles of St. Peter. But their death was
amply revenged; the emperor attacked the Romans on all sides, and near
one thousand citizens paid with their lives the forfeit of their licentiousness
or their indiscretion.</p>

<p>Restless and ambitious minds, like those of Adrian and Frederick Barbarossa,
could not remain long at peace, when the power and privileges they possessed
in their dependence upon each other were so ill defined. The first cause
of dispute, after the pacification above related, was a letter which Adrian
wrote to the emperor, accusing him of ingratitude for the benefits he had
enjoyed through his ministration.</p>

<p>Adrian found it necessary to appease the anger which both Frederick
and his subjects expressed at these instances of assumption, and tranquillity
was for a brief space restored. But scarcely had the angry feelings generated
in the late dispute subsided, when the pontiff again manifested his
inclination to oppose the views of the emperor by refusing to confirm the archbishop
of Ravenna, whom Frederick had elevated to that station, in his
appointment. The fierceness with which the pontiff spoke and wrote on
this occasion, threatened Christendom with a rupture as injurious to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605"></a>[605]</span>
peace as that between the unfortunate Henry and Gregory VII. But Frederick’s
firmness was unshaken; and a barrier was thus erected against the
attempts of the pope, which, intended only as a protection to particular
rights, did, in reality, afford support to the universal principles of civil government.
To Adrian’s threat that he would deprive him of his crown, he
replied that he held his crown, not from him but from his own royal predecessors.
“In the days of Constantine,” he asked, “had St. Silvester
anything to do with the royal dignity? Yet this was the prince to whom
the church was indebted for its peace and its liberty: and all that you enjoy
as pope, whence comes it but from the emperors?
Render unto God that which is
God’s, and to Cæsar the things that are
Cæsar’s. Our churches and our cities
are shut against your cardinals; because
they are not preachers but robbers, they
are not peacemakers but plunderers; we
see that instead of coming to preach the
Gospel and promote peace, their whole
desire and endeavour is to amass gold and
silver. When we find that they are what
the church would have them, we will refuse
them nothing good for their support. It
is horrible that pride, that monster so detestable,
should be able to steal even into
the chair of St. Peter.”<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3c2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>ADRIAN’S FIRMNESS</h5>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p605.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bishop of the Twelfth Century</span></p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">[1158 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Peace became more hopeless. As a last
resource, six cardinals on the part of the
pope, and six German bishops on that of
the emperor, were appointed to frame a
treaty. But the pope demanded the re-establishment
of the compact made with
his predecessor Eugenius. The imperial
bishops reproached the pope with his own
violation of that treaty by his alliance with
the king of Sicily; the Germans unanimously
rejected the demands of the pope:
and now the emperor received with favour a deputation from the senate and
people of Rome. These ambassadors of the republican party had watched;
had been present at the rupture of the negotiations. The pope, with the
embers of Arnold’s rebellions mouldering under his feet; with the emperor
at the head of all Germany, the prelates as well as the princes; with no ally
but the doubtful, often perfidious Norman, stood unshaken; betrayed no
misgivings. He threatened the emperor with a public excommunication.</p>

<p>Did the bold sagacity of Adrian foresee the heroic resolution with which
Milan and her confederate Lombard cities would many years afterwards,
and after some dire reverses and long oppression, resist the power of Barbarossa?
Did he calculate with prophetic foresight the strength of Lombard
republican freedom? Did he anticipate the field of Legnano, when the
whole force of the Teutonic empire was broken before the carroccio of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606"></a>[606]</span>
Milan? Already was the secret treaty framed with Milan, Brescia, and
Crema. These cities bound themselves not to make peace with the emperor
without the consent of the pope and his Catholic successor. Adrian was
preparing for the last act of defiance, the open declaration of war, the excommunication
of the emperor, which he was pledged to pronounce after the
signature of the treaty with the republics, when his death put an end to this
strange conflict, where each antagonist was allied with a republican party
in the heart of his adversary’s dominions. Adrian IV died at Anagni;
his remains were brought to Rome, and interred with the highest honours,
and with the general respect if not the grief of the city, in the church of
St. Peter. Even the ambassadors of Frederick were present at the funeral.
So ended the poor English scholar, at open war with perhaps the mightiest
sovereign who had reigned in transalpine Europe since Charlemagne.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3e2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>TWO RIVAL POPES</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1158-1164 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The death of Adrian saved the church from the danger which had threatened
it during the government of that fierce and overbearing pontiff. But,
while delivered from one set of evils, it was surrounded by others little less
calculated to injure its interests. The cardinals, having assembled to elect
a new pope, chose by a large majority of their body Rolando, a cardinal, and
chancellor of the Roman church. Their vote, however, was opposed by Cardinal
Octavian, who had expected to be nominated by his colleagues to
the vacant dignity; and when Rolando, who assumed the name of Alexander
III, was invested with the pontifical cope, he rudely and sacrilegiously
pulled it from his shoulders, and, but for the interference of the persons
present, would have put it on himself. As he was disappointed in this, he
obtained, by signal, a cope of the same kind, which he suddenly threw over
his shoulders, placing, in his haste, the hind part before. Loud laughter
followed this mistake; but Octavian felt no shame at the mingled ridicule
and rebuke with which he was assailed. Going forth from the assembly,
which he awed into silence by a band of armed men, he exercised, under the
name of Victor IV, the part of sovereign pontiff; and for some days kept
Alexander in close confinement.</p>

<p>The emperor Frederick did not look with indifference on these occurrences.
A division in the church was equivalent to a great increase in his own
power; and he warmly espoused the cause of Octavian, chiefly, as it appears,
because he was the head of a faction. He at last, however, summoned a
council to consider the question between the rival popes. The council
assembled at Pavia, and Octavian was declared pope by the fifty bishops,
the numerous abbots, and other dignitaries, of whom the meeting was composed.
But Alexander was supported by the whole of that powerful party
which contended for the doctrine of papal supremacy; and despising the decree
of deposition passed against him at Pavia, he excommunicated the
emperor for the part he had taken, and absolved his subjects from their oath
of allegiance. Victor, on the other hand, was recognised as lawful pope,
not only in Germany, but in England and France; by the monarchs of which
countries he was received at Couci on the Loire, with all the pomp and
ceremony which had been demanded for his successors by the haughty
Adrian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1164-1198 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>He died in the year 1164; but the schism was continued by the immediate
election of Paschal III, who retained the semblance of authority about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607"></a>[607]</span>
three years. Alexander, on the death of Victor, had ventured to return to
Rome, which he did not dare to attempt during the life-time of that ecclesiastic.
A pestilence, which swept off the flower of Frederick’s army, saved the pope
from ruin; and the emperor, obliged as he was to make his escape into Germany
as he best might, at length expressed his willingness to heal the schism
which he had created in the church. Peace was accordingly restored, and
Alexander returned.</p>

<p>On the death of Alexander, Ubaldo, bishop of Ostia, was elected without
opposition, and assumed the name of Lucius III (1181-1185), and it has
been noted, that at his election the cardinals first appropriated the right of
choosing the supreme pontiff without the interference of the people, or of
the other orders of the clergy. Popular indignation was loudly expressed.
Obliged to seek safety by flight, he called upon the great European states
to furnish him with supplies for the support of his rights against the disaffected
citizens. His claims were allowed, and the riches of England and
other countries were poured freely into his treasury. With these he made
head against the insurgents; but such was the fierceness with which they
resisted him, that they tore out the eyes of the clergy whom they met beyond
the walls of the city; and obliged him to fix his residence at Verona, where
he died in 1185. Urban III, Gregory VIII, and Clement III, passed their
brief pontificates at a distance from Rome. The last-named pope, however,
made peace with the senate and the people; and his successor, Celestine III,
was enabled, by the strength of his position, to exercise the most important
of his assumed privileges without interruption. Henry VI, who at one time
received from his hands<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> the imperial crown, was at another punished by
him with the ban of excommunication.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3c3"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3c">c</a></span> On his death he was succeeded by
Innocent III.</p>

<h5>INNOCENT III</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1198 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Under Innocent III, the papal power rose to its utmost height.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The
thirteenth century is nearly commensurate with this supremacy of the pope.
Innocent III at its commencement calmly exercised as his right, and handed
down strengthened and almost irresistible to his successors, that which, at
its close, Boniface asserted with repulsive and ill-timed arrogance, endangered,
undermined, and shook to its base.</p>

<p>The essential inherent supremacy of the spiritual over the temporal power,
as of the soul over the body, as of eternity over time, as of Christ over Cæsar,
as of God over man, was now an integral part of Christianity. Ideas obtain
authority and dominion, not altogether from their intrinsic truth, but rather
from their constant asseveration, especially when they fall in with the common
hopes and fears, the wants and necessities of human nature. The mass of
mankind have neither leisure nor ability to examine them; they fatigue, and
so compel the world into their acceptance; more particularly if it is the duty,
the passion, and the interest of one great associated body to perpetuate them,
while it is neither the peculiar function, nor the manifest advantage of any
large class or order to refute them.</p>

<p>The unity of the vast Christian republic was an imposing conception,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608"></a>[608]</span>
which, even now that history has shown its hopeless impossibility, still
infatuates lofty minds; its impossibility, since it demands for its head not
merely that infallibility in doctrine so boldly claimed in later times, but
absolute impeccability, in every one of its possessors; more than impeccability,
an all-commanding, indefeasible, unquestionable majesty of virtue,
holiness, and wisdom. Without this it is a baseless tyranny, a senseless
usurpation. In those days it struck in with the whole feudal system, which
was one of strict gradation and subordination; to the hierarchy of church
and state was equally wanting the crown, the sovereign liege lord.</p>

<p>When this idea was first promulgated in all its naked sternness by Gregory
VII, it had come into collision with other ideas rooted with almost equal
depth in the mind of man, that especially of the illimitable Cæsarian power,
which though transferred to a German emperor, was still a powerful tradition,
and derived great weight from its descent from Charlemagne. The
humiliation of the emperor was degradation; it brought contempt on the
office, scarcely redeemed by the abilities, successes, or even virtues of new
sovereigns; the humiliation of the pope was a noble suffering in the cause
of God and truth, the depression of patient holiness under worldly violence.
In every schism the pope who maintained the loftiest churchmanship had
eventually gained the superiority which the imperialising popes had sunk
into impotence, obscurity, ignominy.</p>

<h5>THE INFLUENCE OF THE CRUSADES ON PAPAL POWER</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1198-1201 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Crusades, as elsewhere described, had made the pope not merely the
spiritual, but in some sort the military suzerain of Europe; he had the power
of summoning all Christendom to his banner; the raising the cross, the
standard of the pope, was throughout Europe a general and compulsory levy,
the <i>Heerbann</i> of all who bore arms, of all who could follow an army. That
which was a noble act of devotion had become a duty; not to assume the cross
was sin and impiety. The Crusades thus became a kind of forlorn hope
upon which all the more dangerous and refractory of the temporal sovereigns
might be employed, so as to waste their strength, if not lose their lives, by
the accidents of the journey, or by the sword of the Mohammedan. If they
resisted, the fearful excommunication hung over them, and was ratified by the
fears and by the wavering allegiance of their subjects. If they obeyed and
returned, as most of them did, with shame and defeat, they returned shorn of
their power, lowered in the public estimation, and perhaps still pursued, on
account of their ill success, with the inexorable interdict. It was thus by
trammelling their adversaries with vows which they could not decline, and
from which they could not extricate themselves; by thus consuming their
wealth and resources on this wild and remote warfare, that the popes, who
themselves decently eluded, or were prevented by age or alleged occupations
from embarkation in these adventurous expeditions, broke and wasted away
the power and influence of the emperors.</p>

<p>The Crusades, too, had now made the western world tributary to the
popedom; the vast subventions raised for the Holy Land were to a certain
extent at the disposal of the pope. The taxation of the clergy on his authority
could not be refused for such an object; a tenth of all the exorbitant
wealth of the hierarchy passed through his hands. An immense financial
system grew up; papal collectors were in every land, papal bankers in every
capital to transmit these subsidies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609"></a>[609]</span></p>

<p>But after all none of these accessory and, in some degree, fortuitous aids,
could have raised the papal authority to its commanding height,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> had it not
possessed more sublime and more lawful claims to the reverence of mankind.
It was still an assertion of eternal principles of justice, righteousness, and
humanity. However it might trample on all justice, sacrifice righteousness
to its own interests, plunge Europe in desolating wars, perpetuate strife in
states, set sons in arms against their fathers, fathers against sons, it was
still proclaiming a higher ultimate end. The papal language, the language
of the clergy, was still ostentatiously, profoundly religious; it professed,
even if itself did not always respect, even though it tampered with, the
awful sense of retribution before an all-knowing, all-righteous God. In his
highest pride, the pope was still the servant of the servants of God; in all
his cruelty he boasted of his kindness to the transgressor; every contumacious
emperor was a disobedient son; the excommunication was the voice of
a parent, who affected at least reluctance to chastise.</p>

<p>If this great idea was ever to be realised of a Christian republic with a
pope at its head&mdash;and that a pope of a high Christian character (in some
respects, in all perhaps but one, in tolerance and gentleness almost impossible
in his days, and the want of which, far from impairing, confirmed his
strength)&mdash;none could bring more lofty, more various qualifications for its
accomplishment, none could fall on more favourable times than Innocent III.
Innocent was Giovanni Lothario Conti, an Italian of noble birth, but not of
a family inextricably involved in the petty quarrels and interests of the
princedoms of Romagna. He was of the Conti,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> who derived their name in
some remote time from their dignity. The elevation of his uncle to the
pontificate as Clement III paved the way to his rapid rise. He was elevated
in his twenty-ninth year to the cardinalate under the title vacated by his
uncle.</p>

<p>Celestine on his death-bed had endeavoured to nominate his successor;
he had offered to resign the papacy if the cardinals would elect John of
Colonna. But, even if consistent with right and with usage, the words
of dying sovereigns rarely take effect. Of twenty-eight cardinals, five only
were absent; of the rest the unanimous vote fell on the youngest of their
body, on the cardinal (Giovanni) Lothario. Lothario was only thirty-seven
years old, almost an unprecedented age for a pope.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The cardinals who proclaimed
him saluted him by the name of Innocent, in testimony of his
blameless life. In his inauguration sermon broke forth the character of the
man; the unmeasured assertion of his dignity, protestations of humility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610"></a>[610]</span>
which have a sound of pride. “Ye see what manner of servant that is
whom the Lord hath set over his people; no other than the vicegerent of
Christ, the successor of Peter. He stands in the midst between God and
man; below God, above man; less than God, more than man. He judges
all, is judged by none, for it is written, ‘I will judge.’ But he whom the
pre-eminence of dignity exalts is lowered by his office of a servant, that so
humility may be exalted, and pride abased; for God is against the high-minded,
and to the lowly he shows mercy; and he who exalteth himself
shall be abased. Every valley shall be lifted up, every hill and mountain
laid low!”</p>

<p>The letters in which he announced his election to the king of France,
and to the other realms of Christendom, blend a decent but exaggerated
humility with the consciousness of power; Innocent’s confidence in himself
transpires through his confidence in the divine protection.</p>

<p>The state of Christendom might have tempted a less ambitious prelate to
extend and consolidate his supremacy. Wherever Innocent cast his eyes
over Christendom and beyond the limits of Christendom, appeared disorder,
contested thrones, sovereigns oppressing their subjects, subjects in arms
against their sovereigns, the ruin of the Christian cause. In Italy the crown
of Naples on the brows of an infant; the fairest provinces under the galling
yoke of fierce German adventurers; the Lombard republics, Guelf or Ghibelline,
at war within their walls, at war or in implacable animosity against each
other; the empire, distracted by rival claimants for the throne, one vast
scene of battle, intrigue, almost of anarchy; the tyrannical and dissolute
Philip Augustus king of France, before long the tyrannical and feeble John
of England.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Empire is tottering to its fall; the kingdom of Jerusalem
confined almost to the city of Acre. Every realm seems to demand, or at
least to invite, the interposition, the mediation, of the head of Christendom;
in every land one party at least, or one portion of society, would welcome
his interference in the last resort for refuge or for protection.</p>

<p>Nor did Innocent shrink from that which might have crushed a less
energetic spirit to despair; from the Jordan to the Atlantic, from the Mediterranean
to beyond the Baltic, his influence is felt and confessed; his vast
correspondence shows at once the inexhaustible activity of his mind; he is
involved simultaneously or successively in the vital interests of every kingdom
in the western world.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3e3"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>THE AUTOCRACY OF INNOCENT III</h5>

<p>In order to secure Sicily for her son, the empress Constantia, pressed hard
by parties, was obliged to accept the papal investment under the new conditions
prescribed by the pontiff. After Constantia’s death (the 27th of
November, 1198) Innocent ruled over all Sicily in the character of guardian.
Still further the disputed imperial election, by which Germany was divided
between Philip, duke of Swabia, and Otto, duke of Saxony, encouraged the
pope to a larger extension of his power. Immediately after his accession,
Innocent had already taken the oath of fealty to the imperial <i>præfectus urbis</i>;
now he dislodged the vassals of the empire from the territory of Matilda, and
established in Tuscany a civic league.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1201-1216 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>After he had thus consolidated his power in Italy, he commenced an
energetic interference in German politics; for he forthwith claimed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611"></a>[611]</span>
right to decide on a disputed imperial election. He must naturally have been
inclined rather to the Guelf than to the Hohenstaufen candidate, so maintaining
his pretensions he actually decided (1201) in favour of Otto IV. However,
he was resisted with great energy by Philip’s party, and the flame of
discord only burned so much the brighter in Germany. As Philip continued
to gain more decisive advantages over his enemy, Innocent began negotiations
with him, which seemed fraught with danger to Otto. Meanwhile
Philip was murdered by Otto of Wittelsbach in Bamberg (1208). Otto IV
was then universally recognised as emperor, and after he had satisfied
the pope’s demands in all points he was crowned by him. But so soon
as Otto had reached this goal of his wishes, he began again to vindicate
the imperial rights in Italy, and to overthrow the pope’s new creations,
without suffering himself to be turned from his path by the sentence of
excommunication and dethronement which the deluded Innocent pronounced
against him in November, 1210. Now he himself encouraged the canvass of
the only surviving Hohenstaufen. Frederick appeared in Germany in 1212,
and, upheld as he was by the pope and the king of France, he quickly won
most of all ranks to his side. On the 25th of July, 1215, he received the
German king’s crown at Aachen, and Otto down to his death (1218) had
to content himself with his ancestral territories in Brunswick.</p>

<h5>UNIVERSAL SWAY OF THE POPE</h5>

<p>On every side, the thunder of Rome broke over the heads of princes.
A certain Swero is excommunicated for usurping the crown of Norway.
A legate, in passing through Hungary, is detained by the king: Innocent
writes in tolerably mild terms to this potentate, but fails not to intimate that
he might be compelled to prevent his son’s accession to the throne. The
king of Leon had married his cousin, a princess of Castile. Innocent
subjects the kingdom to an interdict. When the clergy of Leon petition
him to remove it, because when they ceased to perform their functions the
laity paid no tithes and listened to heretical teachers when orthodox mouths
were mute, he consented that divine service with closed doors, but not the
rites of burial, might be performed. The king at length gave way, and sent
back his wife.</p>

<p>But a more illustrious victory of the same kind was obtained over Philip
Augustus, who, having repudiated Ingeborg of Denmark, had contracted
another marriage. The conduct of the king, though not without the usual
excuse of those times, nearness of blood, was justly condemned; and Innocent
did not hesitate to visit his sins upon the people by a general interdict.
This, after a short demur from some bishops, was enforced throughout
France; the dead lay unburied, and the living were cut off from the offices
of religion, till Philip, thus subdued, took back his divorced wife. The submission
of such a prince, not feebly superstitious, like his predecessor Robert,
nor vexed with seditions, like the emperor Henry IV, but brave, firm, and
victorious, is perhaps the proudest trophy on the scutcheon of Rome.</p>

<p>Compared with this, the subsequent triumph of Innocent over the pusillanimous
John seems cheaply gained, though the surrender of a powerful
kingdom into the vassalage of the pope may strike us as a proof of stupendous
baseness on one side and audacity on the other.</p>

<p>A disputed election furnished Innocent with an opportunity of thrusting
forward the cardinal Stephen Langton into the archbishopric of Canterbury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612"></a>[612]</span>
against the king’s will. When John resisted with anger, the pope laid
England under an interdict, in 1208, and afterwards excommunicated the
king; the latter sought by reckless cruelty to avenge himself on the clergy,
and by severe oppression to make sure of his vassals. At last Innocent
deposed him from his kingdom, and handed it over to the king of France.
But while he was arming himself for the conquest, John, unable to trust his
vassals, yielded in all points, and even received his kingdom in fee from the
pope under circumstances of the greatest humiliation. Now was England
yielded up to the discretion of an arbitrary pope and a contemptible king;
this united the prelates and the barons to wrest Magna Charta from the king
in 1215. In vain the pope with spiritual and the king with temporal weapons
strove to effect its repeal; John’s death, however, in 1216, quickly put an end
to internal discord.</p>

<p>Still greater prospects seemed to open themselves before the pope in
Constantinople. Although the enthusiasm for crusades was already much
diminished, nevertheless Innocent had succeeded, by unwearied efforts, in
collecting a new army at Venice in 1202. The crafty doge, Enrico Dandolo,
notwithstanding all papal admonitions, had first made use of the army for the
reconquest of Zara (Jadera); it was then induced by the magnificent
promises of a Greek prince, Alexius, to undertake an expedition against
Constantinople; and when the reinstated emperor Isaac Angelus was unable
to fulfil these promises, Constantinople was conquered, and a Latin empire
established there, by the exaltation of Baldwin, count of Flanders, to the
throne. Thus the church of Constantinople seemed now to be brought into
subjection to the Roman see. However, even now, no one doubted the
precariousness of this acquisition. For the new empire already contained
the germ of dissolution; on the other hand it completely foiled the powerful
enterprise in behalf of Palestine.</p>

<p>In the latter year of his life Innocent devoted especial attention to the
Holy Land: King Frederick took the cross even at his coronation; and at
the Lateran council of the year 1215, one of the most brilliant which had ever
been held, the accomplishment of another crusade was one of the chief ends
in view. The enthusiasm for the Holy Land was indeed by no means
extinct; but in Germany the continuance of the twofold reign of Frederick
and Otto led to many unfavourable opinions of the Roman see, which necessarily
obstructed its readiness to undertake a fresh crusade.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3k"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3k">k</a></span></p>

<h5>MILMAN’S ESTIMATE OF INNOCENT III</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1198-1216 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the full vigour of his manhood died Innocent III, 1216. He, of all
the popes, had advanced the most exorbitant pretensions, and those pretensions
had been received by an age most disposed to accept them with humble
deference. The high and blameless, in some respects wise and gentle, character
of Innocent might seem to approach more nearly than any one of the
whole succession of Roman bishops to the ideal height of a supreme pontiff;
in him, if ever, might appear to be realised the churchman’s highest conception
of the vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>Gregory VII and Boniface VIII, the first and the last of the aggressive
popes, and the aged Gregory IX, had no doubt more rugged warfare to
encounter, fiercer and more unscrupulous enemies to subdue. But in all
these there was a personal sternness, a contemptuous haughtiness; theirs
was a worldly majesty. The pride of Innocent was calmer, more self-possessed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613"></a>[613]</span>
his dignity was less disturbed by degrading collisions with rude
adversaries; he died on his unshaken throne, in the plenitude of his seemingly
unquestioned power. Yet if we pause and contemplate, as we cannot
but pause and contemplate, the issue of this highest, in a certain sense
noblest and most religious contest for the papal ascendency over the world
of man, there is an inevitable conviction of the unreality of that papal power.
With all the grandeur of his views, with all the persevering energy of his
measures, throughout Innocent’s reign, everywhere we behold failure, everywhere
immediate discomfiture, or
transitory success which paved the
way for future disaster. The higher
the throne of the pope the more
manifestly were its foundations undermined,
unsound, unenduring.</p>

<p>Even Rome does not always
maintain her peaceful subservience.
Her obedience is interrupted, precarious;
that of transient awe, not
of deep attachment, or rooted reverence.
In the empire it is impossible
not to burden the memory of
Innocent with the miseries of the
long civil war. Otto without the
aid of the pope could not have
maintained the contest for a year;
with all the pope’s aid he had
sunk into contempt, almost insignificance;
he was about to be
abandoned, if not actually abandoned,
by the pope himself. The
casual blow of the assassin alone
prevented the complete triumph
of Philip. Already he had extorted
his absolution; Innocent was compelled
to yield, and could not yield
without loss of dignity. The triumph
of Otto leads to as fierce,
and more perilous resistance to the
papal power than could have been
expected from the haughtiness of
the Hohenstaufen. The pope has
an irresistible enemy in Italy itself. Innocent is compelled to abandon the
great object of the papal policy, the breaking the line of succession in the house
of Swabia, and to assist in the elevation of a Swabian emperor. He must yield
to the union of the crown of Sicily with that of Germany, and so bequeath to
his successors the obstinate and perilous strife with Frederick II.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p613.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Thirteenth Century Monk</span></p>
</div>

<p>In France, Philip Augustus is forced to seem, yet only seem, to submit;
the miseries of his unhappy wife are but aggravated by the papal protection.
The death of Agnes of Méran, rather than Innocent’s authority, heals the
strife. The sons of the proscribed concubine succeed to the throne of
France.</p>

<p>In England the barons refuse to desert John when under the interdict of
the pope; when the pope becomes the king’s ally, resenting the cession of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614"></a>[614]</span>
the realm, they withdraw their allegiance. Even in Stephen Langton, who
owes his promotion to the pope, the Englishman prevails over the ecclesiastic;
the Great Charter is extorted from the king when under the express
protection of the holy see, and maintained resolutely against the papal
sentence of abrogation; and in the Great Charter is laid the first stone of
the religious as well as the civil liberties of the land.</p>

<p>Venice, in the crusade, deludes, defies, baffles the pope. The crusaders
become her army, besiege, fight, conquer for her interests. In vain the pope
protests, threatens, anathematises; Venice calmly proceeds in the subjugation
of Zara. To the astonishment, the indignation of the pope, the crusaders’
banners wave not over Jerusalem, but over Constantinople. But for
her own wisdom, Venice might have given an emperor to the capital of the
East; she secures the patriarchate almost in defiance of the pope; only when
she has entirely gained her ends does she submit to the petty and unregarded
vengeance of the pope.</p>

<p>Even in the Albigensian war the success was indeed complete; heresy
was crushed, but by means of which Innocent disapproved in his heart. He
had let loose a terrible force, which he could neither arrest nor control.
The pope can do everything but show mercy or moderation. He could not
shake off, the papacy has never shaken off, the burden of its complicity in the
remorseless carnage perpetrated by the crusaders in Languedoc, in the
crimes and cruelties of Simon de Montfort. A dark and ineffaceable stain
of fraud and dissimulation too has gathered around the fame of Innocent
himself.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Heresy was quenched in blood; but the earth sooner or later
gives out the terrible cry of blood for vengeance against murderers and
oppressors.</p>

<p>The great religious event of this pontificate, the foundation of the
Mendicant orders, that which perhaps perpetuated, or at least immeasurably
strengthened, the papal power for two centuries, was extorted from the
reluctant pope. Both St. Dominic and St. Francis were coldly received,
almost contemptuously repelled. It was not till either his own more mature
deliberation or wiser counsel, which took the form of divine admonition,
prevented this fatal error and prophetically revealed the secret of their
strength and of their irresistible influence throughout Christendom, that
Innocent awoke to wisdom. He then bequeathed these two great standing
armies to the papacy; armies maintained without cost, sworn, more than
sworn, bound by the unbroken chains of their own zeal and devotion to
unquestioning, unhesitating service throughout Christendom, speaking all
languages. They were colonies of religious militia, natives of every land,
yet under foreign control and guidance. Their whole power, importance,
perhaps possessions rested on their fidelity to the see of Rome, that fidelity
guaranteed by the charter of their existence. Well might they appear so
great as they are seen by the eye of Dante, like the cherubim and seraphim
in paradise.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3e4"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3e">e</a></span></p>

<h5>FREDERICK II AT WAR WITH THE PAPACY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1216-1244 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Honorius III, previously called Cencio Savelli, who succeeded Innocent,
1216, and governed the Roman church more than ten years, did not perform
so many deeds worthy of being recorded; yet he was very careful that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_615"></a>[615]</span>
Romish power should receive no diminution. Pursuing this course, he had
a grievous falling out with the emperor Frederick II, a magnanimous prince,
whom he himself had crowned at Rome in the year 1220. Frederick, imitating
his grandfather, laboured to establish and enlarge the authority of the
emperors in Italy, to depress the minor states and republics of Lombardy, and
to diminish the immense wealth and power of the pontiffs and the bishops;
and to accomplish these objects, he continually deferred the crusade, which
he had promised with an oath. Honorius, on the other hand, continually
urged Frederick to enter on his expedition to Palestine; yet he secretly
encouraged, animated, and supported the cities and republics that resisted
the emperor, and raised various impediments to the latter’s increasing power.
Still, this hostility did not, at present, break out in open war.</p>

<p>But under Gregory IX&mdash;whose former name was Ugolino, and who was
elevated from the bishopric of Ostia to the pontificate, 1227, an old man,
but still bold and resolute&mdash;the fire, which had been long burning in
secret, burst into a flame.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In the year 1227 the pontiff excommunicated the
emperor, who still deferred his expedition to Palestine; but without proceeding
in due form of ecclesiastical law, and without regarding the
emperor’s excuse of ill health. In the year 1228 the emperor sailed
with his fleet to Palestine; but instead of waging war as he was bound to
do, he made a truce with Saladin on recovering Jerusalem. While he was
absent the pontiff raised war against him in Apulia, and endeavoured to
excite all Europe to oppose him. Therefore Frederick hastened back, in the
year 1229, and after vanquishing his enemies, made his peace with the pontiff
in the year 1230. But this peace could not be durable, as Frederick
would not submit to the control of the pontiff. Therefore, as the emperor
continued to press heavily on the republics of Lombardy, which were friendly
to the pontiff, and transferred Sardinia, which the pontiff claimed as part of
the patrimony of the church, to his son Enzio; and wished to withdraw Rome
itself from the power of the pontiff; and did other things very offensive to
Gregory&mdash;the pontiff, in the year 1239, again laid him under anathemas;
and accused him to all the sovereigns of Europe of many crimes and enormities,
and particularly of speaking contemptuously of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>The emperor, on the other hand, avenged the injuries that he received,
both by written publications and by his military operations in Italy, in which
he was for the most part successful; and thus he defended his reputation,
and also brought the pontiff into perplexity and difficulty. To rescue himself,
in some measure, in the year 1240 Gregory summoned a general council
to meet at Rome, intending to hurl the emperor from his throne by the
united suffrages of the assembled fathers. But Frederick, in the year 1241,
captured the Genoese fleet, which was carrying a great part of the fathers
to the council at Rome, and seizing as well their treasures as themselves, he
cast them into prison. Broken down by these calamities, and by others of
no less magnitude, Gregory shortly after sank into the grave.</p>

<p>The successor of Gregory, Goffredo Castiglione of Milan, who assumed
the name of Celestine IV, died before his consecration; and after a long
interregnum, in the year 1243, Senibaldi, a Genoese, descended from the
counts Fieschi, succeeded under the pontifical name of Innocent IV, a man
inferior to none of his predecessors in arrogance and insolence of temper.
Between him and Frederick there were at first negotiations for peace; but
the terms insisted on by the pontiff were deemed too harsh by the emperor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616"></a>[616]</span>
Hence Innocent, feeling himself unsafe in any part of Italy, in 1244 removed
from Genoa to Lyons in France; and the next year assembled a council
there, in the presence of which, but without its approbation (whatever the
Roman writers may affirm to the contrary), he declared Frederick unworthy
of the imperial throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1244-1274 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>This most unrighteous decision of the pontiff had such influence upon
the German princes, who were infected with the superstition of the times,
that they elected first Henry, landgraf of Thuringia, and on his death William,
count of Holland, to the imperial throne. Frederick continued the
war vigorously and courageously in Italy, and with various successes, until
a dysentery terminated his life in Apulia, on the 13th of December, 1250.
On the death of his foe, Innocent returned to Italy in the year 1251. From
this time especially (though their origin was much earlier) the two noted
factions of Guelfs and Ghibellines, of which the former sided with the pontiffs
and the latter with the emperors, most unhappily rent asunder and devastated
all Italy.</p>

<p>Alexander IV, whose name as count of Segni and bishop of Ostia was
Rinaldo, became pontiff on the death of Innocent (1254) and reigned six
years and six months. Excepting some efforts to put down a grandson
of Frederick II, called Conradin, and to quiet the perpetual commotions
of Italy, he busied himself more in regulating the internal affairs of the
church than in national concerns. The mendicant friars, Dominicans and
Franciscans, are under especial obligations to him. Urban IV, before his
election to the pontificate in 1261, was James, patriarch of Jerusalem, a man
born of obscure parentage at Troyes. He distinguished himself more by
instituting the festival of the Body of Christ than by any other achievement.
He indeed formed many projects: but he executed few of them, being
prevented by death, in the year 1264, after a short reign of three years. Not
much longer was the reign of Clement IV, a Frenchman and bishop of Sabina,
under the name of Guido Fulcodi (Guy Foulques), who was created pontiff
in the year 1265. Yet he is better known on several accounts, but especially
for conferring the kingdom of Naples on Charles of Anjou, brother to Louis
IX, the king of France. Charles is well known to have beheaded Conradin,
the only surviving grandson of Frederick II, after conquering him in battle,
and this, if not by the counsel, at least with the consent of the pontiff.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>On the death of Clement IV<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> there were vehement contests among the cardinals,
respecting the election of a new pontiff; which continued till the third
year, when, at last, 1271, Teobaldo of Piacenza, archdeacon of Liège, was
chosen, and assumed the name of Gregory X. He had been called from Palestine,
where he had resided; and having witnessed the depressed state of the
Christians in the Holy Land, nothing more engaged his thoughts than sending
them succour.</p>

<h5>COUNCIL AT LYONS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1274-1294 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as he was consecrated, he appointed a council to be
held at Lyons in France, and attended it in person in the month of May,
1274. The principal subjects discussed were the re-establishment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_617"></a>[617]</span>
Christian dominion in the East, and the reunion of the Greek and Latin
churches. This has commonly been reckoned the fourteenth general council,
and is particularly noticeable for the new regulations it established for the
election of Roman pontiffs, and the celebrated provision which is still in force
requiring the cardinal electors to be shut up in conclave. Neither did the
pontiff, though of a milder disposition than many others, hesitate to repeat
and inculcate that odious maxim of Gregory VII, that the pontiff is supreme
lord of the world, and especially of the Roman Empire. For in the year 1271
he sent a menacing letter to the princes of Germany, admonishing them to
elect an emperor, and without regarding the wishes or the claims of Alfonso,
king of Castile; otherwise he would appoint a head of the empire himself.
Accordingly, the princes assembled, and elected Rudolf I, of the house of
Habsburg.</p>

<p>Gregory X died in the year 1276, and his three immediate successors
were all chosen and died in the same year. Innocent V, previously Pietro di
Tarantaisia, was a Dominican monk, and bishop of Ostia. Adrian V was
a Genoese, named Ottoboni, and cardinal of St. Adrian. John XXI,
previously Pedro, bishop of Tusculum, was a native of Portugal. The next
pontiff, who came to the chair in 1277, reigned longer. He was Giovanni
Gaetano, of the family of Ursini, a Roman, and cardinal of St. Nicholas, who
assumed the title of Nicholas III. He greatly enlarged what is called the
patrimony of St. Peter; and, as his actions show, had formed other great
projects, which he would undoubtedly have accomplished, as he was a man
of energy and enterprise, had he not prematurely died in the year 1280.</p>

<p>His successor, Martin IV, elected by the cardinals in 1281, was a French
nobleman, Simon de Brion, a man of equal boldness and energy of character
with Nicholas. For he excommunicated Michael Palæologus, the Greek
emperor, because he had violated the compact of union with the Latins,
which was settled at the Council of Lyons. Pedro of Aragon he deprived of
his kingdoms and of all his property, because he had seized upon Sicily; and
he bestowed them gratuitously on Charles, son to the king of France. He
was projecting many other things, consonant with the views of the pontiffs,
when he was suddenly overtaken by death in 1285. His plans were prosecuted
by his successor, Giacomo Savelli, who was elected in 1285 and took the
name of Honorius IV. But a distressing disease in his joints, of which he
died in 1287, prevented him from attempting anything further. Nicholas IV,
previously Girolamo d’Ascoli, bishop of Palestrina, who attained to the
pontifical chair in 1288, and died in 1292, was able to attend to the affairs
both of the church and of the nations with more diligence and care. Hence
he is represented in history sometimes as the arbiter in the disputes of
sovereign princes, sometimes as the strenuous asserter of the rights and
prerogatives of the church, and again as the assiduous promoter of missionary
labours among the Tatars and other nations of the East. But nothing
lay nearer his heart than the restoration of the dominion of the Christians
in Palestine, where their cause was nearly ruined. In this he laboured
strenuously indeed, but in vain; for death intercepted all his projects.</p>

<p>After his death the church was without a head till the third year, the
cardinals disagreeing exceedingly among themselves. At length, on the 5th
of July, 1294, they unanimously chose an aged man, greatly venerated for
his sanctity&mdash;Pietro, surnamed di Murrhone, from a mountain in which he
led a solitary and very austere life; he assumed the pontifical name of Celestine
V. But as the austerity of his life tacitly censured the corrupt morals
of the Romish court, and especially of the cardinals, and as he showed very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_618"></a>[618]</span>
plainly that he was more solicitous to advance the holiness of the church
than its worldly grandeur, he was soon considered as unworthy of the office
which he had reluctantly assumed. Hence some of the cardinals, and especially
Benedict Cajetan, persuaded him very easily to abdicate the chair, in
the fourth month of his pontificate. He died, 1296, in the castle of Fumone,
where his successor detained him a captive, lest he should make some disturbance.
But afterwards Clement V enrolled him in the calendar of the
saints. To him the sect of Benedictine monks who were called, after him,
Celestines, owed its origin; a sect still existing in Italy and France, though
now nearly extinct, and differing from the other Benedictines by their more
rigid rules of life.</p>

<h5>ACCESSION OF BONIFACE VIII</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1294-1301 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>He was succeeded in 1294 by Benedict, Cardinal Cajetan, by whose persuasions
he had been chiefly led to resign the pontificate, and who now
assumed the name of Boniface VIII. This was a man formed to produce
disturbance both in church and state, and eager for confirming and enlarging
the power of the pontiffs, to the highest degree of rashness. From his first
entrance on the office he arrogated to himself sovereign power over all things
sacred and secular; overawed kings and states by his fulminations; decided
important controversies at his will; enlarged the code of canon law by new
accessions, namely, by the sixth book of <i>Decretals</i>; made war, among others,
particularly on the noble family of Colonna, which had opposed his election&mdash;in
a word, he seemed to be another Gregory VII at the head of the
church. At the close of the century, he established the year of jubilee,
which is still solemnised at Rome.</p>

<p>That the governors of the church, as well of highest rank as of inferior,
were addicted to all those vices which are the most unbecoming to men in
their stations, is testified most abundantly. As for the Greek and oriental
clergy, many of whom lived under oppressive governments, we shall say
nothing; although their faults are sufficiently manifest. But of the faults
of the Latins silence would be the less proper, in proportion to the certainty
that from this source the whole community was involved in the greatest
calamities. All the honest and good men of that age ardently wished for a
reformation of the church, both in its head and in its members, as they themselves
expressed it. But to so desirable an event there were still many
obstacles. First, the power of the pontiffs was so confirmed by its long
continuance that it seemed to be immovably established. In the next place,
extravagant superstition held the minds of the majority of the people in
abject slavery. And lastly, the ignorance and barbarism of the times quickly
extinguished the sparks of truth that appeared from time to time. Yet the
dominion of the Roman pontiffs, impregnable and durable as it seemed to
be, was gradually undermined and weakened in this century, partly by the
rash insolence of the pontiffs themselves and partly by the occurrence of
certain unexpected events.</p>

<h5>PHILIP THE FAIR OVERPOWERS THE PAPACY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1301-1305 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The commencement of this important change must be referred to the
contest between Boniface VIII, who governed the Latin church at the beginning
of this century, and Philip the Fair, king of France. This high-minded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_619"></a>[619]</span>
sovereign first taught the Europeans what the emperors had in vain
attempted&mdash;that the Roman bishops could be vanquished, and be laid under
restraint. In a very haughty letter addressed to Philip, Boniface maintained
that all kings and persons whatever, and the king of France as well as others,
by divine command, owed perfect obedience to the Roman pontiff, and this
not merely in religious matters, but likewise in secular and human affairs.
The king replied with extreme bitterness. The pontiff repeated his former
assertions with greater arrogance, and published the celebrated bull called
<i>Unam sanctam</i>; in which he asserted that Jesus Christ had granted a twofold
power or sword to his church, a spiritual and a temporal; that the whole
human race was subjected to the pontiff; and that all who dissented from
this doctrine were heretics, and could not expect to be saved. The king, on
the contrary, in an assembly of his nobles, in 1303, through the famous lawyer,
Guillaume de Nogaret, publicly accused the pontiff of heresy, simony,
dishonesty, and other enormities; and urged the calling of a general council
to depose from his office a pontiff so very wicked. The pontiff, in return,
excommunicated the king and all his adherents the same year.</p>

<p>Soon after receiving this sentence, Philip again, in an assembly of the
states of his kingdom, entered a formal complaint against the pontiff, by
men of the highest reputation and influence; and appealed to the decision of
a future general council of the church. He then despatched Guillaume de
Nogaret, with some others, into Italy, to rouse the people to insurrection,
and to bring the pontiff prisoner to Lyons, where he wished the council
to be held. Nogaret, who was a resolute and energetic man, having drawn
over to his interest the Colonna family, which was at variance with the
pontiff, raised a small force, suddenly attacked Boniface, who was living
securely at Anagni, made him prisoner, wounded him, and, among other
severe indignities, struck him on the head with his iron gauntlet. The
people of Anagni, indeed, rescued the pontiff from the hands of his furious
enemy; but he died shortly after, at Rome, in the month of October, from
rage and anguish of mind.</p>

<p>Benedict XI, previously Nicolo of Trevigio, the successor of Boniface,
profiting by his example, restored the king of France and his kingdom to
their former honours and privileges, without even being solicited; but he was
unwilling to absolve from his crime Nogaret, who had so grievously offended
against the pontifical dignity. This daring man, therefore, prosecuted strenuously
the suit commenced against Boniface in the Romish court; and, in the
name of the king, demanded that a mark of infamy should be set upon the
deceased pontiff.</p>

<p>Benedict XI died in the year 1304; and Philip, by his secret machinations,
caused Bertrand d’Agoust, a Frenchman, and archbishop of Bordeaux, to
be created pontiff at Rome, on the 5th of June, 1305. For the contest of
the king against the pontiffs was not yet wholly settled, Nogaret not being
absolved, and it might easily break out again. Besides, the king thirsted
for revenge, and designed to extort from the court of Rome a condemnation
of Boniface; he also meditated the destruction of the Templars,
and other matters of great importance which he could hardly expect from
an Italian pontiff. He therefore wished to have a French pontiff, whom he
could control according to his pleasure, and who would be in a degree
dependent on him. The new pontiff, who took the name of Clement V,
remained in France, as the king wished, and transferred the pontifical court
to Avignon, where it continued for seventy years. This period the Italians
call the Babylonian Captivity.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3n"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3n">n</a></span></p>

<h5>HALLAM ON THE CLIMAX OF PAPAL POWER</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1198-1305 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The noonday of papal dominion extends from the pontificate of Innocent
III inclusively to that of Boniface VIII; or, in other words, through
the thirteenth century. Rome inspired during this age all the terror of her
ancient name. She was once more the mistress of the world, and kings
were her vassals. In her long contention with the house of Swabia, she
finally triumphed. After his deposition by the Council of Lyons, the affairs
of Frederick II went rapidly into decay. With every allowance for the
enmity of the Lombards and the jealousies of Germany, it must be confessed,
that his proscription by Innocent IV and Alexander IV was the main cause
of the ruin of his family.</p>

<p>This general supremacy effected by the Roman church over mankind in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, derived material support from the
promulgation of the canon law. By means of her new jurisprudence Rome
acquired in every country a powerful body of advocates who, though many
of them were laymen, would, with the usual bigotry of lawyers, defend
every pretension or abuse, to which their received standard of authority
gave sanction.</p>

<p>Next to the canon law, we should reckon the institution of the mendicant
orders among those circumstances which principally contributed to the
aggrandisement of Rome. By the acquisition, and in some respects the
enjoyment, or at least ostentation of immense riches, the ancient monastic
orders had forfeited much of the public esteem. No means appeared so
efficacious to counteract this effect as the institution of religious societies,
strictly debarred from the insidious temptations of wealth. These new
preachers were received with astonishing approbation by the laity, whose
religious zeal usually depends a good deal upon their opinion of sincerity
and disinterestedness in their pastors. And the progress of the Dominican
and Franciscan friars in the thirteenth century bears a remarkable analogy
to that of the English Methodists. Aware of the powerful support they
might receive in turn, the pontiffs of the thirteenth century accumulated
benefits upon the disciples of Francis and Dominic. They were exempted
from episcopal authority; they were permitted to preach or hear confessions
without leave of the ordinary, to accept of legacies, and to inter in their
churches. It was naturally to be expected that the objects of such extensive
favours would repay their benefactors by a more than usual obsequiousness
and alacrity in their service. Accordingly, the Dominicans and Franciscans
vied with each other in magnifying the papal supremacy.</p>

<p>We should not overlook, among the causes that contributed to the
dominion of the popes, their prerogative of dispensing with ecclesiastical
ordinances. The most remarkable exercise of this was as to the canonical
impediments of matrimony. Such strictness as is prescribed by the Christian
religion with respect to divorce was very unpalatable to the barbarous nations.
They in fact paid it little regard; under the Merovingian dynasty, even
private men put away their wives at pleasure. In many capitularies of
Charlemagne, we find evidence of the prevailing license of repudiation and
even polygamy. The principles which the church inculcated were in
appearance the very reverse of this laxity; yet they led indirectly to the
same effect. Marriages were forbidden, not merely within the limits which
nature, or those inveterate associations which we call nature, have rendered
sacred, but as far as the seventh degree of collateral consanguinity, computed
from a common ancestor. Not only was affinity, or relationship by marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621"></a>[621]</span>
put upon the same footing as that by blood; but a fantastical connection,
called spiritual affinity, was invented in order to prohibit marriage between
a sponsor and godchild. A union, however innocently contracted, between
parties thus circumstanced, might at any time be dissolved, and their subsequent
cohabitation forbidden. Innocent III laid down as a maxim that out
of the plenitude of his power he might lawfully dispense with the law; and
accordingly granted, among other instances of this prerogative, dispensations
from impediments of marriage to the emperor Otto IV. Similar indulgences
were given by his successors, though they did not become usual for some
ages. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 removed a great part of the
restraint by permitting marriages beyond the fourth degree, or what we call
third cousins; and dispensations had been made more easy when it was discovered
that they might be converted into a source of profit. They served
a more important purpose by rendering it necessary for the princes of
Europe, who seldom could marry into one another’s houses without transgressing
the canonical limits, to keep on good terms with the court of Rome,
which, in several instances that have been mentioned, fulminated its censures
against sovereigns who lived without permission in what was considered an
incestuous union.</p>

<p>The dispensing power of the popes was exerted in several cases of a
temporal nature, particularly in the legitimation of children for purposes
even of succession. This Innocent III claimed as an indirect consequence
of his right to remove the canonical impediment which bastardy offered to
ordination; since it would be monstrous, he says, that one who is legitimate
for spiritual functions should continue otherwise in any civil matter. But
the most important and mischievous species of dispensations was from the
observance of promissory oaths. Two principles are laid down in the <i>Decretals</i>&mdash;that
an oath disadvantageous to the church is not binding; and that
one extorted by force was of slight obligation, and might be annulled by
ecclesiastical authority. As the first of these maxims gave the most
unlimited privilege to the popes of breaking all faith of treaties which
thwarted their interest or passion, a privilege which they continually
exercised, so the second was equally convenient to princes, weary of observing
engagements towards their subjects or their neighbours.</p>

<p>It must appear to every careful inquirer that the papal authority, though
manifesting outwardly more show of strength every year, had been secretly
undermined and lost a great deal of its hold upon public opinion, before the
accession of Boniface VIII, in 1294, to the pontifical throne. The clergy
were rendered sullen by demands of money, invasions of the legal right of
patronage, and unreasonable partiality to the mendicant orders; a part
of the mendicants themselves had begun to declaim against the corruptions of
the papal court; while the laity, subjects alike and sovereigns, looked upon
both the head and the members of the hierarchy with jealousy and dislike.
Boniface, full of inordinate arrogance and ambition, and not sufficiently
sensible of this gradual change in human opinion, endeavoured to strain to a
higher pitch the despotic pretensions of former pontiffs. As Gregory VII
appears the most usurping of mankind till we read the history of Innocent
III, so Innocent III is thrown into shade by the superior audacity of
Boniface VIII. But independently of the less favourable dispositions of the
public, he wanted the most essential quality for an ambitious pope&mdash;reputation
for integrity.</p>

<p>The sensible decline of the papacy is to be dated from the pontificate of
Boniface VIII, who had strained its authority to a higher pitch than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622"></a>[622]</span>
of his predecessors. There is a spell wrought by uninterrupted good fortune,
which captivates men’s understanding, and persuades them, against reasoning
and analogy, that violent power is immortal and irresistible. The spell is
broken by the first change of success. In tracing the papal empire over
mankind, we have no marked and definite crisis of revolution. But slowly,
like the retreat of waters or the stealthy pace of old age, that extraordinary
power over human opinion has been subsiding for five centuries. As the
retrocession of the Roman terminus under Adrian gave the first overt proof
of decline in the ambitious energies of that empire, so the tacit submission of
the successors of Boniface VIII to the king of France might have been hailed
by Europe as a token that their influence was beginning to abate. Imprisoned,
insulted, deprived eventually of life by the violence of Philip, a
prince excommunicated, and who had gone all lengths in defying and
despising the papal jurisdiction, Boniface had every claim to be avenged by
the inheritors of the same spiritual dominion. When Benedict XI rescinded
the bulls of his predecessor, and admitted Philip the Fair to communion
without insisting on any concessions, he acted perhaps prudently, but gave a
fatal blow to the temporal authority of Rome.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_3l"><a href="#papacy_endnote_3l">l</a></span></p>

<h4 id="PAPACY_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV. FROM EXILE TO SUPREMACY</h4>

<div class="sidenote">[1305-1513 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The period in the papal history has arrived which in the Italian writers
is called the Babylonish Captivity; it lasted more than seventy years (from
1305 to 1376). Rome is no longer the metropolis of Christendom; the pope
is a French prelate. The successor of St. Peter is not on St. Peter’s throne;
he is environed with none of the traditionary majesty or traditionary sanctity
of the Eternal City; he has abandoned the holy bodies of the apostles, the
churches of the apostles. It is perhaps the most marvellous part of its history
that the papacy, having sunk so low, sank no lower; that it recovered
from its degradation; that, from a satellite, almost a slave of the king of
France, the pontiff ever emerged again to be an independent potentate; and,
although the great line of mediæval popes, of Gregory, of Alexander III, and
the Innocents, expired in Boniface VIII, he could resume even his modified
supremacy. There is no proof so strong of the vitality of the papacy as that
it could establish the law that wherever the pope is, there is the throne of St.
Peter; that he could cease to be bishop of Rome in all but in name, and then
take back again the abdicated bishopric.</p>

<p>Never was revolution more sudden, more total, it might seem more enduring
in its consequences. The close of the last century had seen Boniface VIII
advancing higher pretensions, if not wielding more actual power than any
former pontiff; the acknowledged pacificator of the world, the arbiter between
the kings of France and England, claiming and exercising feudal as
well as spiritual supremacy over many kingdoms, bestowing crowns as in
Hungary, awarding the empire; with millions of pilgrims at the jubilee
in Rome, still the centre of Christendom, paying him homage which bordered
on adulation and pouring the riches of the world at his feet. The first
decade of the new century is not more than half passed; Pope Clement V
is a voluntary prisoner, but not the less a prisoner in the realm, or almost
within the precincts of France; struggling in vain to escape from the
tyranny of his inexorable master, and to break or elude the fetters wound
around him by his own solemn engagements. He is almost forced to condemn
his predecessor for crimes of which he could hardly believe him guilty;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_624"></a>[624]</span>
to accept a niggardly, and perhaps never-fulfilled penance from men almost
murderers of a pope; to sacrifice, on evidence which he himself manifestly
mistrusted, the Templars, one of the great military orders of Christendom,
to the hatred or avarice of Philip. The pope, from lord over the freedom
of the world, has ceased to be a free agent.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4b1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>CLEMENT V</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1305-1311 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The pontiffs being at a distance, the Ghibelline faction in Italy, which
was hostile to the pontiffs, assumed greater boldness than formerly, and not
only invaded and laid waste the territories of St. Peter, but also assailed the
pontifical authority by their publications. Hence a number of cities revolted
from the popes; Rome itself became the parent and fomenter of tumults, cabals,
and civil wars; and the laws and decrees sent thither from France were publicly
treated with contempt, and not merely by the nobles but also by the
common citizens. A great part of Europe followed the example of Italy;
and numberless examples show that the people of Europe attributed far less
power to the fulminations and decrees issued from France than to those issued
from Rome. Various seditions, therefore, were raised in one place and another
against the pontiffs, which they were unable to subdue and put down, notwithstanding
that the inquisitors were most active in the discharge of their
functions.</p>

<p>As the French pontiffs could derive but little revenue from Italy, which
was rent into factions, seditious, and devastated, they were obliged to devise
new modes of raising money. They, therefore, not only sold indulgences to the
people more frequently than formerly, to the great indignation of kings and
princes, but they likewise required enormous prices to be paid for their letters
or bulls of every kind. In this thing John XXII showed himself peculiarly
adroit and shrewd; for though he did not first invent the regulations and fees
of the apostolic chancery, yet the Romish writers admit that he enlarged them
and reduced them to a more convenient form. He also is said to have imposed
that tribute which under the title of <i>annates</i> is customarily paid to the
pontiffs; yet the first commencement of it was anterior to that age. Moreover,
these French pontiffs, subverting the rights of election, assumed the power of
conferring all sacred offices, whether high or low, according to their own pleasure;
by which means they raised immense sums of money. Hence, under
these pontiffs, those most odious terms reservation, provision, and expectative,
rarely used before, were now everywhere heard, and they called forth the
bitterest complaints from all the nations of Europe; and these complaints increased
immeasurably when some of the pontiffs, John XXII, Clement VI,
Gregory XI, publicly announced that they had reserved all churches to themselves,
and that they would provide for all without exception, by virtue of the
sovereign right which Christ had conferred on the vicars, or in the plenitude
of their power. By these and other artifices for filling their treasury and
amassing property these indiscreet pontiffs heaped additional odium on the
apostolic see, and thus weakened very considerably the papal empire, which
began to decline from the time of Boniface.</p>

<p>Clement V was governed all his life by the will and pleasure of Philip
the Fair, king of France. Guillaume de Nogaret, the implacable foe of Boniface
VIII, though excommunicated, resolutely prosecuted his own cause and
that of King Philip against Boniface in the papal court; a transaction
which, we believe, is without a parallel. Philip wished to have the body of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625"></a>[625]</span>
Boniface disinterred and publicly burned. With great difficulty Clement
averted this infamy by his entreaties and advice; but in everything else he
had to obey the king. Accordingly he abrogated the laws enacted by Boniface,
granted the king five years’ tithes, absolved Nogaret from all crime,
after imposing on him a slight penance, which he never performed; restored
the inhabitants of Anagni to their former reputable and good standing, and
held a general council at Vienne, 1311, that Philip’s pleasure might be
gratified in the suppression of the Templars.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4c1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>THE FATE OF THE TEMPLARS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1311-1313 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The end of Clement himself and of Clement’s master, the king of France,
drew near. But the pope and the king must be preceded into the realm of
darkness and to the judgment-seat of heaven by other victims. The tragedy
of the Templars had not yet drawn to its close.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The four great dignitaries of
the order, the grand-master De Molay, Guy the commander of Normandy,
son of the dauphin of Auvergne, the commander of Aquitaine Godfrey de
Gonaville, the great visitor of France Hugues de Peraud, were still pining
in the royal dungeons. It was necessary to determine on their fate. The
king and the pope were now equally interested in burying the affair forever
in silence and oblivion. So long as these men lived uncondemned, undoomed,
the order was not extinct. A commission was named. The grand-master
and the rest were found guilty, and were to be sentenced to perpetual
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Six years of dreary imprisonment had passed over their heads; of their
valiant brethren the most valiant had been burned alive, the recreants had
purchased their lives by confession; the pope in a full council had condemned
and dissolved the order. If a human mind, a mind like that of De
Molay, not the most stubborn, could be broken by suffering and humiliation,
it must have yielded to this long and crushing imprisonment. The cardinal-archbishop
of Albi ascended a raised platform; he read the confessions of the
knights, the proceedings of the court; he enlarged on the criminality of
the order, on the holy justice of the pope, and the devout, self-sacrificing
zeal of the king; he was proceeding to the final, the fatal sentence. At that
instant the grand-master advanced; his gesture implored silence; judges
and people gazed in awe-struck apprehension.</p>

<p>In a calm, clear voice De Molay spoke: “Before heaven and earth, on
the verge of death, where the least falsehood bears like an intolerable weight
upon the soul, I protest that we have richly deserved death, not on account
of any heresy or sin of which ourselves or our order have been guilty, but
because we have yielded, to save our lives, to the seductive words of the
pope and of the king; and so by our confessions brought shame and ruin on
our blameless, holy, and orthodox brotherhood.”</p>

<p>The cardinals stood confounded; the people could not suppress their
profound sympathy. The assembly was hastily broken up; the provost was
commanded to conduct the prisoners back to their dungeons: “To-morrow
we will hold further council.”</p>

<p>But on the moment that the king heard these things, without a day’s
delay, without the least consultation with the ecclesiastical authorities, he
ordered them to death as relapsed heretics. On the island in the Seine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626"></a>[626]</span>
where now stands the statue of Henry IV, between the king’s garden on one
side and the convent of the Augustinian monks on the other, the two pyres
were raised (two out of the four had shrunk back into their ignoble confessions).
It was the hour of vespers when these two aged and noble men were
led out to be burned. Both, as the smoke rose to their lips, as the fire crept
up to their vital parts, continued solemnly to aver the innocence, the Catholic
faith of the order. The king himself beheld this hideous spectacle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1313-1316 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The wonder and the pity of the times which immediately followed not only
arrayed De Molay in the robes of the martyr, but gave him the terrible
language of a prophet. “Clement, iniquitous and cruel judge, I summon
thee within forty days to meet me before the throne of the Most High.”
According to some accounts this fearful sentence included the king, by
whom, if uttered, it might have been heard. The earliest allusion to this
awful speech does not contain that striking particularity which, if part of it,
would be fatal to its credibility&mdash;the precise date of Clement’s death. It
was not till the year after that Clement and King Philip passed to their account.
The poetic relation of Godfrey de Paris simply states that De Molay declared
that God would revenge their death on their unrighteous judges. The rapid
fate of these two men during the next year might naturally so appal the
popular imagination as to approximate more closely the prophecy and its
accomplishment. At all events it betrayed the deep and general feeling
of the cruel wrong inflicted on the order; while the unlamented death of the
pope, the disastrous close of Philip’s reign, and the crimes of his family
seemed as declarations of heaven as to the innocence of their noble victims.</p>

<p>The health of Clement V had been failing for some time. From his
court, which he held at Carpentras, he set out in hopes to gain strength from
his native air at Bordeaux. He had hardly crossed the Rhone when he was
seized with mortal sickness at Roquemaure. The papal treasure was seized
by his followers, especially his nephew; his remains were treated with such
utter neglect that the torches set fire to the catafalque under which he lay,
not in state. His body, covered only with a single sheet, all that his rapacious
retinue had left to shroud their forgotten master, was half burned (not,
like those of the Templars, on his living body) before alarm was raised. His
ashes were borne back to Carpentras and solemnly interred.</p>

<p>Clement left behind him evil fame. He died shamefully rich. To his
nephew (nepotism had begun to prevail in its baleful influence) he bequeathed
not less than 300,000 golden florins, under the pretext of succour to the
Holy Land. He had died still more wealthy but that his wealth was drained
by more disgraceful prodigality. It was generally believed that the beautiful
Brunisand de Foix, countess of Talleyrand Périgord, was the pope’s mistress;
to her he was boundlessly lavish, and her influence was irresistible
even in ecclesiastical matters. Rumour ran that her petitions to the lustful
pontiff were placed upon her otherwise unveiled bosom. Italian hatred of a
transalpine pope, Guelfic hatred of a Ghibelline pope, may have lent a too
greedy ear to these disreputable reports; but the large mass of authorities is
against the pope; in his favour, hardly more than suspicious silence.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4b2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>JOHN XXII TO URBAN V</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1316-1333 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>On the death of Clement, 1314, there were violent contests among the
cardinals respecting the election of a successor, the French demanding a
French pontiff and the Italians an Italian. After two years the French gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627"></a>[627]</span>
the victory; and in 1316, Jacques d’Euse of Cahors, cardinal of Porto, was
made head of the church, and assumed the pontifical name of John XXII. He
was not destitute of learning, but was crafty, insolent, weak, imprudent, and
avaricious, as even those who honour his memory do not positively deny.
He rendered himself notorious by many imprudent and unsuccessful enterprises,
but especially by his unfortunate
contest with the emperor, Ludwig of Bavaria.
There was a contest for the empire of Germany
between Ludwig of Bavaria and
Frederick of Austria, each being chosen
emperor by a part of the electors in the year
1314. John declared that the decision of
this controversy belonged to him. But Ludwig,
having conquered his rival in battle
and taken him prisoner, in the year 1322,
assumed the government of the empire, without
consulting the pontiff, and refused to
submit a cause which had been decided by the
sword to another trial before the pontiff.</p>

<p>John was greatly offended at this, and in
the year 1324 divested the emperor of all
title to the imperial crown. Ludwig, in
return, accused the pontiff of corrupting the
faith, or of heresy; and appealed to the decision
of a council. Exasperated by this and
other things, the pontiff, in the year 1327,
again divested the emperor of all his authority
and power, and laid him under excommunication.
In revenge for this injury the
emperor, in the year 1328, at Rome, publicly
declared John unworthy of the pontificate;
and substituted in his place Pietro di Corvara,
a Franciscan monk, and one of those who
disagreed with the pontiff; and he, assuming
the name of Nicholas V, crowned Ludwig
emperor. But in the year 1330, this imperial
pontiff voluntarily abdicated his office, and surrendered himself into the
hands of John, who kept him a prisoner at Avignon till his death. Thus
John continued to reign in spite of the emperor, as did the emperor in
spite of the pontiff.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p627.jpg" width="200" height="425" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Priest of the Fourteenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the side of Ludwig stood the whole mass of the Fratricelli, the
Beghards (or Beguins) of every description, and the Spirituals, or more
rigid among the Franciscans; and these, being scattered over a large part of
Europe, and supported by the protection of Ludwig, everywhere assailed
John with reproaches and criminations, both orally and in books, and charged
him with religious apostasy. The pontiff, however, was not greatly injured
by these private attacks; but towards the close of his life he fell under the
disapprobation and censure of nearly the whole church. For in the years
1331 and 1332, he taught in some public discourses that departed souls
would indeed behold Christ, but would not see the face of God or the divine
nature until their reunion with the body at the last day. With this doctrine,
Philip VI, the king of France, was highly displeased; the theologians
of Paris condemned it in 1333; and both the friends and the foes of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_628"></a>[628]</span>
pontiff were opposed to it. For it appeared to them that the pontiff
detracted much from the blessedness of departed spirits. To so great opposition
John, though naturally pertinacious, had to give way. He therefore
first apologised for the doctrine; and afterwards, when near the point of
death, 1334, he did not indeed abandon it, but he qualified it by saying that
he believed souls in the intermediate state saw the divine essence, as far as
the state and condition of the disembodied spirit would permit. But this
declaration did not satisfy his adversaries. Hence, after various disputes,
his successor Benedict XII terminated the controversy, according to the
decision of the Parisian doctors, by declaring the true faith to be that the
souls of the blessed, when separate from the body, fully and perfectly behold
the divine nature, or God himself. Benedict could do this without impeaching
his predecessor; for John, when dying, submitted his opinion to the
judgment of the church, lest, perhaps, he should after death be classed
among heretics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1333-1362 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>On the death of John, 1334, new contests between the French and the
Italians, respecting the choice of a pontiff, divided the college of cardinals.
But near the close of the year, Jacques de Nouveau called Fournier, a Frenchman,
cardinal of St. Prisca, was chosen, and assumed the name of Benedict
XII. Historians allow him the praise of being an upright and honest man,
no less free from avarice than from the lust of rule. During his reign the
controversy with the emperor Ludwig was at rest. For although he did not
restore him to church communion, being prevented, as is reported by the king
of France, yet he did not attempt anything against him. He saw the existing
evils in the church, and some of them, as far as he could, he removed;
in particular he laboured to reform by decrees and ordinances the orders of
the monks, both mendicant and opulent. But death removed him, when he
was contemplating more and greater changes, in 1342. Overlook superstition,
which was the common fault of his age, and we shall find nothing to
prevent us from declaring this pontiff to have been a right-spirited man.</p>

<p>Of a different spirit was his successor, Clement VI, who was likewise a
Frenchman, named Pierre Roger, and cardinal of St. Nereus and St. Achilles.
To say nothing of his other deeds, that are little to be commended, he trod
in the steps of John XXII by his provisions and reservations of churches,
which was evidence of a shameful avarice; further, he conferred the most
important spiritual offices on foreigners and Italians, which produced controversies
between him and the kings of France and England; and, lastly,
he demonstrated the arrogance and pride of his heart, among other things,
by renewing the war with Ludwig the Bavarian. For, in the year 1343, he
hurled new thunders at the emperor; and finding these to be contemned by
Ludwig, in the year 1346, he devoted him again to execration; and persuaded
the princes of Germany to elect Charles IV, grandson of Henry VII,
for their emperor. A civil war would now have broken out in Germany, had
not the death of Ludwig, in 1347, prevented it. Clement followed him to
the grave, in 1352, famous for nothing but his zeal for exalting the majesty
of the pontiffs, and for adding Avignon, which he bought of Joanna queen of
Naples, to St. Peter’s patrimony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1362-1378 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>There was more moderation and probity in Innocent VI, or Etienne d’Albert,
a Frenchman, previously bishop of Ostia, who governed the church ten
years, and died in 1362. He favoured his own relatives too much; but in
other respects encouraged the pious and the well-informed, held the monks to
their duty, abstained from reserving churches, and did many things worthy of
commendation. His successor, Guillaume de Grimoard, abbot of St. Victor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_629"></a>[629]</span>
at Marseilles, who assumed the name of Urban V, was also free from
great faults, if we except those which are almost inseparable from the office
of a pope. Overcome by the entreaties of the Romans, he removed to
Rome in the year 1367, but returned again to Avignon in 1370, in order
to make peace between the king of England and the king of France, and died
there the same year.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Pierre Roger, a Frenchman of noble birth, under
the pontifical name of Gregory XI. He was inferior to his predecessors in
virtue, but exceeded them in energy and audacity. Under him great and
dangerous commotions disturbed Italy and the city of Rome. The Florentines,
especially, waged fierce war with the Romish church, and were successful
in it. To restore the tranquillity of Italy, and recover the territories and
cities taken from the patrimony of St. Peter, Gregory, in the year 1376,
transferred his residence from Avignon to Rome. One Catherine, a virgin
of Siena, whom that credulous age took to be a prophetess divinely inspired,
came to Avignon, and by her exhortations greatly contributed to this measure.
But Gregory soon after repented of his removal; for by their long
absence from Italy the authority of the pontiffs was so fallen there that the
Romans and the Florentines had no scruple to insult and abuse him in various
ways. He therefore purposed to return to Avignon, but was prevented by
death, which removed him from among living men in the year 1378.</p>

<p>After the death of Gregory XI, the cardinals being assembled to provide
a successor, the Roman people, fearing lest a Frenchman should be elected
who would remove to Avignon, demanded, with furious clamours and threats,
that an Italian should be placed at the head of the church without delay.
The terrified cardinals proclaimed Bartolommeo Prignani, who was a Neapolitan
by birth, and archbishop of Bari, to be elected pontiff; and he assumed
the name of Urban VI. This new pontiff, by his coarse manners, his injudicious
severity, and his intolerable haughtiness, alienated the minds of all from
him, but especially the cardinals. These, therefore, withdrew to Fondi, a
city in the kingdom of Naples, and there created another pontiff, Robert
count of Geneva, who took the name of Clement VII, alleging that Urban
was elected only in pretence, in order to quiet the rage of the people of Rome.
Which of these was the legitimate and true pontiff still remains uncertain,
nor can it be fully ascertained from the records and documents which have
been published in great abundance by both parties. Urban continued at
Rome; Clement removed to Avignon in France.</p>

<p>Thus the unity of the Latin church, as existing under one head, came to
an end at the death of Gregory XI; and that most unhappy disunion ensued,
which is usually denominated “the great schism of the West.” For during
fifty years the church had two or three heads; and the contemporary pontiffs
assailed each other with excommunications, maledictions, and insidious measures.
The calamities and distress of those times are indescribable. For
besides the perpetual contentions and wars between the pontifical factions,
which were ruinous to great numbers, involving them in loss of life or
of property, nearly all sense of religion was in many places extinguished, and
wickedness daily acquired greater impunity and boldness. The clergy, previously
corrupt, now laid aside even the appearance of piety and godliness,
while those who called themselves Christ’s vicegerents were at open war with
each other; and the conscientious people, who believed that no one could be
saved without living in subjection to Christ’s vicegerents, were thrown into
the greatest perplexity and anxiety of mind. Yet both the church and the
state received very considerable advantages from these great calamities. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_630"></a>[630]</span>
the very sinews of pontifical power were cut by these dissensions, and no art
could heal them any more; kings, too, and princes, who had before been in
a sense the servants of the pontiffs, now became their judges and masters.
Moreover, great numbers, possessing some measure of discernment, despising
and disregarding pontiffs, fighting for dominion, committed themselves and
their salvation to God alone, in full assurance that the church and religion
might be safe and continue so, although without any visible head.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4c2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4c">c</a></span></p>

<h5>THE GREAT SCHISM OF THE WEST (1378-1417 A.D.)</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1378-1389 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Clement was immediately recognised as pope in Scotland, Savoy, and
Lorraine, afterwards in Castile (1381), Aragon (1387), and Navarre (1390).
On the other hand Germany, England, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and
Prussia remained on Urban’s side.</p>

<p>The war between the two popes was not only waged with sentences
of excommunication, but in Italy with secular weapons also. Urban declared
that Queen Joanna, by her secession from his side, had forfeited the
kingdom of Naples, and granted it in fee to Charles, duke of Durazzo. On
the other hand Joanna, under Clement’s influence, took Louis, duke of Anjou,
at that time regent of France, for her adopted son and successor (1380).
Charles meanwhile in a short time made himself master of the whole kingdom,
took Joanna prisoner in 1381, and had her put to death, when Louis
appeared in Italy at the head of an army (1382). Charles continued to
maintain his ascendency, and Louis’ death (1384) would have been decisive
as regards Naples in favour of Urban and Charles forever, had not differences
forthwith arisen between the two latter, which increased to such
a degree, when the headstrong pope went in person to Naples, that Urban
pronounced sentence of dethronement and excommunication against Charles,
and was consequently besieged by him in the castle of Lucera at Salerno
(1385). He escaped to Genoa (September, 1385) without becoming wiser.
By the cruel execution of five cardinals he made himself still more hateful.
After Charles’ death (1386) by his impolitic refusal to invest his son
Ladislaus (or Lancelot) with Naples, he exposed this kingdom afresh to the
danger of falling under the dominion of France. The capital city was
already conquered for the young Louis of Anjou (1387), and the whole
kingdom would have fallen to him and the French pope, had not Urban’s
successor, Boniface IX, at the right moment, invested Ladislaus (1390) and
rendered him his powerful support. With a view to secure the states of the
church against Louis, Boniface granted many towns and castles in fee to
powerful nobles, and thus roused afresh in Rome a struggle for independence,
which kept him long in banishment from the city. True, Louis was
forced to quit Italy altogether (1400), and Ladislaus remained king of
Naples. But this restless agitation in Rome increased, and was even supported
by Ladislaus, who wished to make himself master of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1389-1409 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>As the schism lessened the revenues of the popes and increased their
expenses, so it caused a fresh aggravation of those church oppressions which
were already intolerable. The French pontiff, Clement VII, was obliged
indeed to exercise the right of presentation to ecclesiastical offices, to which
now also were added the <i>gratiæ exspectativæ</i>, according to the nod of the
French court, upon which he was quite dependent; but in return for this
the church of France, so long as her grievances were not too loudly expressed,
was delivered over as a prey to his extortions. Tithes <i>vacantiæ</i> and <i>annates</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_631"></a>[631]</span>
were now the standing income of the papal cabinet. In addition to these
Clement laid claim to the spoils of deceased prelates. His successor, Benedict
XIII, wherever it was possible, surpassed him in these systems of
impoverishment.</p>

<p>So long as Urban VI lived, the Roman curia was advantageously distinguished
in this respect from that of Avignon. His successor, Boniface IX,
on the contrary, imitated all the extortions of his rivals in France, but he
far surpassed them in the simony which was practised quite publicly by himself
and the members of his curia, and was even defended without any sense
of shame. Thus at the end of this period both obediences were groaning
under the weight of persecution. England alone repeatedly threw off every
papal oppression, and in 1404 Hungary also followed her example.</p>

<p>In consequence of these church oppressions, which were the result of the
schism, the religious scruples which were entertained with regard to it were
strengthened, and earlier steps demanded for its settlement. The university
of Paris in particular laboured with unshaken perseverance to bring the
schism to a close. After she had long waited in vain for a sound agreement
of the two popes betwixt themselves, she at last obtained permission from
the court of France to interpose her opinion upon these events (1394).
Benedict XIII, notwithstanding his promise made before his election, showed
even less inclination than his predecessor to take serious steps to close the
schism. To the urgent proposals of a French national synod in 1395 he
returned only an evasive answer. The university nevertheless persevered in
her endeavour, and at length contrived that Charles VI, king of France,
should join with the emperor Wenceslaus in forcing both the popes to
resign (1398).</p>

<p>The latter was in very truth too weak to keep his word; moreover he was
himself deposed by the secret machinations of his pope Boniface IX (1400).
On the other hand, by the decree of a new national synod France withdrew
from the obedience of Benedict; Castile followed her example (1398), and
this pope was kept a prisoner at Avignon. It was not till after the lapse of
many years, and the breach of express engagements, that Benedict succeeded
in regaining the church of France to his obedience (1403) by the help of the
duke of Orleans, who at that time had won the ascendency at court. It was
quickly manifest how little he meant to keep these promises; but as the
Italian cardinals imposed similar engagements upon their new pope Innocent
VII, on his election in 1404, even only with a view to save appearances, it
was necessary to open negotiations. The fruitlessness of this proceeding
increased the general discontent; France threatened her pope with a fresh
withdrawal of allegiance (national council of January, 1407), when at length
both the popes agreed upon a personal interview at Savona in September,
1407. Benedict appeared there in person; however, Gregory XII went
only as far as Lucca, and opened fresh negotiations for another place of congress.
This public breach of promise roused the Roman cardinals; they forsook
their pope Gregory, and renounced their allegiance to him, at the same
time that France withdrew from the obedience of Benedict. Benedict indeed
escaped the imprisonment with which he was threatened, by flight to Perpignan;
but the cardinals of both obediences united at Livorno (Leghorn)
and summoned a general council at Pisa in March, 1409, with a view to the
termination of the schism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1378-1417 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The schism with its church oppression furnished the impulse, the weakness
of the papal see gave the long desired opportunity for an unbiased
trial of the existing state of the church; it led men to opinions which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632"></a>[632]</span>
hitherto only been mooted in violent struggles with the popes, and so not
without an appearance of passion and party spirit; but now they struck
root so deeply, even among the most faithful adherents of the church, that
they could never again be entirely suppressed. Many an anxious gaze was
turned backwards to the earlier and better ages of the church, in order to
discover in its constitution the remedy for the scandals of the present.
This was a problem of learning. Its representatives, the universities, particularly
that of Paris, were listened to with eager attention, and attained
an influence which was formidable
even to the popes. This comparison
of the present with the earlier
ages of the church could not but lead
to many convictions unfavourable to
the papal see.</p>

<p>True there were but isolated individuals
who advanced so far upon
this line of thought as to wish
the papacy quite removed from the
church as the source of all her evils.
But even its truest adherents now
acknowledged the immoderate extension
of papal power, and the monstrous
exaggeration of the papal
dignity. They discovered in the
bent of the papacy to secular power
the prime cause of all mischief, and
even to the schism, and they wished
the times back again when the emperors
could convoke synods by their
own authority to strangle a schism
at its birth. No less general was
the discontent expressed against the
papal church oppressions, and the
wish to remove them by limitations
of the papal power. Hitherto only
adversaries of the popes, at open war
with them, had appealed to a general
council as a higher authority, but
during the schism circumstances led
to a general acknowledgment that such a council must rank above the pope.
After the Council of Pisa was summoned to terminate the contest between the
two popes, and set a limit to the abuses of papal power, the canonists vied with
each other in demonstrating this new opinion so injurious to the papacy, of
the superiority of general councils to the pope, and thus the papal system
of the last century seemed to be threatened with total overthrow.</p>

<h5>RELATION OF THE NATIONAL CHURCHES TO THE STATE</h5>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Bishop of the Fourteenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>The jealousies betwixt the ecclesiastical and secular tribunals arising
from the immoderate extension of ecclesiastical jurisdiction still continued,
but they began more and more to result in favour of the latter. In Germany
the fundamental principle that secular causes belonged only to secular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633"></a>[633]</span>
tribunals had been recognised long before, even by the prelates, who were
themselves temporal lords of the land; it was, as a general rule, always
maintained, though in individual cases the ecclesiastical tribunals continually
overstepped their limits. But during the schism, the emperor Wenceslaus
could only execute his decisions in things temporal, against the higher
orders of the clergy, by deeds of violence. The cities continued to tax the
excessive revenues of the ecclesiastical sovereignty. They either forbade
altogether the increase of church property, or decreed that all fresh acquisitions
should be alienated again in a year and a day, or required from the
new revenues the customary taxes. Now that the parish priests, by their
management of people’s wills, provided too well for themselves and for the
church, it was determined that wills should only be made before the secular
authorities. Paderborn even prohibited the multiplication of masses for
souls. Still the popes wished to maintain a good understanding with the
cities, and bind them to themselves by means of privileges.</p>

<p>During the schism many concessions were made to the nobles also; thus
Boniface IX, in 1399 allowed Albert IV, duke of Austria, the <i>jus primarum
precum</i>. The free Swiss by the priests’ law (<i>Pfaffenbrief</i>) in 1370 put an
end to the encroachments of the ecclesiastical tribunals. In Italy the operation
of the ecclesiastical tribunals, like the condition of the whole country,
was very fluctuating. Under Ghibelline lords they were often quite suppressed.
In France ecclesiastical jurisdiction had reached its greatest
extension; the kings connived at it, because they wished to keep their
bishops well inclined to themselves, and knew how to tax any irregularities
of the ecclesiastical tribunals. On the other hand the barons were continually
at issue with the prelates on this point, and from both sides there were
unceasing complaints of usurpation. The remarkable negotiations which
were instituted by command of King Philip of Valois with the prelates
summoned before parliament (1329), owing to the king’s political aims,
failed of their intended result. Immediately afterwards the clergy sought
to establish their jurisdiction still firmer by decrees of councils. On the
other hand a powerful resistance to these proceedings was being developed
in parliament, which was now transforming itself into a standing corporation;
this was especially manifest from the time of Charles V. Henceforth
ecclesiastical jurisdiction was not only confined to its proper limits, but parliament
claimed a certain degree of superintendence over it, and drew to
itself the right of decision upon many points, which were at that time universally
held to be ecclesiastical.</p>

<p>The earlier encroachments of the popes upon episcopal rights were still
further increased by the fact that they now took to themselves entirely the
appointment to ecclesiastical offices, and exercised the right of exemption in
the highest degree, particularly during the schism. Thus the importance of
the bishops in the church was small; they compensated themselves for this
by secular honours and worldly enjoyment. The oppression which fell upon
them from above they knew how to discharge upon those below, and so the
lower orders of the clergy groaned beneath intolerable burdens.</p>

<h5>MORAL CONDITION OF THE CLERGY</h5>

<p>The moral condition of the clergy could not fail to degenerate still more
in this period, in consequence of the manner in which ecclesiastical offices
were generally bestowed, the example which the papal court gave, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634"></a>[634]</span>
method in which the ecclesiastical jurisdiction was administered. In
the chapters, where the stalls were for the most part benefices reserved for
the nobles, as well as among the parochial clergy, there prevailed a depth
of ignorance and an immorality which awakened indignation. The continued
struggle of the synods against the dissoluteness of priests remained
quite fruitless. The laity were only too glad to secure their wives and
daughters from the sacerdotal ravishers, and accordingly favoured, at times
even demanded, fixed alliances of their priests with concubines. Thus in
many countries concubinage was publicly allowed among the priests, who
were supposed to be too sacred for a matrimonial connection. The fines with
which these excesses were visited by many synods were quickly changed
into a welcome gratuity to the avarice of the bishops. Nevertheless, every
attempt of the secular power to check these scandals was resisted by the
church as an invasion of her rights.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4d"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4d">d</a></span></p>

<h5>THE GREAT COUNCILS OF PISA AND CONSTANCE; JOHN HUSS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1409-1429 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The Council of Pisa, which was designed to heal the wounds of the
divided church, unexpectedly inflicted upon her a new wound. On the 5th
of June it passed a heavy sentence on each of the pontiffs; for it declared
them both to be heretical, perjured, contumacious, unworthy of any honour,
and no longer members of the church. As the next step, the council created
Pietro Philarghi of Candia sovereign pontiff in their place, on the 26th of
June; and he assumed the name of Alexander V. But the two pontiffs
spurned the decrees of this council, and continued still to perform their
functions. Benedict held a council at Perpignan, and Gregory assembled
another at Austria, near Aquileia; but fearing the resentments of the Venetians,
he went first to Gaeta, where he threw himself upon the protection of
Ladislaus, king of Naples, and then fled, in 1412, to Rimini.</p>

<p>The church was thus divided among three pontiffs, who fiercely assailed
each other with reciprocal excommunications, reproaches, and maledictions.
Alexander V, who was elected in the Council of Pisa, died at Bologna in
1410. The sixteen cardinals, who were present in the city, immediately
filled his place with Baltasare Cossa, a Neapolitan, who took the name of
John XXIII, a man destitute of principle and of piety. From this war
of the pontiffs vast evils arose which afflicted both the church and the state.
Hence the emperor Sigismund, the king of France, and other kings and
princes of Europe, spared no pains nor expense to restore harmony and bring
the church again under one head. From the pontiffs it was found quite
impossible to obtain any personal sacrifice for the peace of the church;
so that no course remained but to assemble a general council of the whole
church, to take cognisance of this great controversy. Such an assembly
John XXIII, being prevailed on by the entreaties of Sigismund and hoping
that it would favour his cause, appointed to be held at Constance in 1414.
In this council were present the pontiff John, the emperor Sigismund, many
princes of Germany, and ambassadors from the absent kings and princes of
Europe, and from the republics.</p>

<p>The principal object of this great council was to extinguish the discord
between the pontiffs; and this business was accomplished successfully. For
having established by two solemn decrees, in the fourth and fifth sessions,
that a pontiff is subject to a council of the whole church, and having most
carefully substantiated the authority of councils, the fathers, on the 29th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_635"></a>[635]</span>
May, 1415, removed John XXIII from the pontificate on account of various
offences and crimes; for he had pledged himself to the council to resign the
pontificate, and yet withdrew himself by flight. Gregory XII voluntarily
resigned his pontificate on the 4th of July in the same year, through Carlo
Malatesta. And Benedict XIII, on the 26th of July, 1417, was deprived of
his rank as a pontiff by a solemn decree of the council. After these transactions,
on the 11th of November, 1417, Otto Colonna was elected pontiff
by the unanimous suffrages of the cardinals, and assumed the name of Martin
V. Benedict XIII, who resided at Perpignan, resisted indeed, and
claimed the rights and the dignity of a pontiff till his death, 1423; and
after the death of this obstinate man, under the auspices of Alfonso, king of
Sicily, Ægidius (Giles) Nuños, a Spaniard, was appointed to succeed him,
by only two cardinals. He assumed the name of Clement VIII, and wished
to be regarded as the legitimate pontiff; but in the year 1429 he was persuaded
to resign the government of the church entirely to Martin V.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1407-1416 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The things done in this council for the repression and extirpation of
heretics are not equally commendable; some of them, indeed, are quite
inexcusable. Before the council sat, great religious commotions had arisen
in several countries, but especially in Bohemia. There lived and taught at
Prague, with much applause, an eloquent and learned man, by name John
Huss, who acted as a professor of theology in the university and as a minister
of holy things in the church. Vehemently did he declaim against priestly
vices of every kind; which was generally done in that age, and no good
man disapproved it. He likewise endeavoured, after the year 1408, to detach
the university from acknowledging as pontiff Gregory XII, whom Bohemia
had hitherto obeyed. This gave great offence to the archbishop of Prague
and to the rest of the clergy, who were devoted partisans of Gregory.
Hence arose great hostility between Huss and the archbishop, which the
former kept up and increased by his discourses against the Romish court and
the vices of the clergy.</p>

<p>To these first causes of hatred against Huss, which might easily have been
surmounted, others were added of greater magnitude. First, he took the
side of the Realists in philosophy, and, therefore, according to the usage of
the age, goaded and pressed the Nominalists to the utmost of his power; yet
their number was very considerable in the university of Prague, and their
influence was not small. Afterwards, in the year 1408, he brought it about
that, in the controversy between the Germans and the Bohemians respecting
the number of votes, the decision was in favour of the Bohemians. By the
laws of the university it was ordained that in academic discussions the
Bohemians should have three votes, and the other three nations but one.
The university was then divided into four nations, but the Bavarian, Polish,
and Saxon were comprehended under the general name of the German
nation. The usage had been that the Germans, who far exceeded the
Bohemians in numbers, gave three votes and the Bohemians but one. Huss,
therefore, either from partiality to his country or from hatred of the Nominalists,
whom the greatest part of the Germans preferred to the Realists,
obtained, by means of the vast influence at court which his eloquence gave
him, a decree that the Germans should be deprived of the three votes and
should be bidden to content themselves with one. This result of a long
contest so offended the Germans that a great multitude of them, with the
rector of the university, Johann Hofmann, at their head, left the university
of Prague and retired to Leipzig, where Frederick the Wise, elector of
Saxony, founded a university on their account in the year 1409. This event<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636"></a>[636]</span>
contributed much to increase the odium against Huss and to work his ruin.
The Germans being ejected from Prague, Huss inveighed more freely than
before against the vices of the clergy, and also publicly preached and recommended
the opinions and the books of John Wycliffe, the Englishman.
[See the history of England.] Being accused before John XXIII, in the
year 1410, he was excommunicated by that pontiff. Spurning this thunderbolt,
he continued, with general applause, first by word of mouth, afterwards
in various writings, to lash the sores of the Roman church and of the priest
of every degree.</p>

<p>This good man, who was in love with real piety, but perhaps had sometimes
too much warmth and not sufficient prudence, being summoned to the
Council of Constance, went thither on the faith of a safe-conduct given by
the emperor Sigismund, with a view to demonstrate his innocence and prove
them liars who talked of him as an apostate from the Roman church. And
certainly he had not departed in things of any moment from the religion of
his times; but had only inveighed severely against the pontiffs, the court
of Rome, the more considerable clergy, and the monks; which in fact had the
sanction of his times, and was daily done in the Council of Constance itself.
Yet his enemies, who were numerous both in Bohemia and in the council,
managed the procedure against him so artfully and successfully that, in violation
of the public faith, he was cast into prison; and when he would not,
according to the council’s order, confess himself guilty, he was adjudged a
heretic, and burned alive, on the 6th day of July, 1415. Full of faith and
the love of God, he sustained this punishment with admirable constancy.
The same unhappy fate was borne with the same pious fortitude and constancy
by Jerome of Prague, the companion of John Huss, who had come to
Constance to support and aid his friend. He yielded at first through fear
of death to the mandates of the council, and renounced those opinions
which the council had condemned in him; but being retained still in prison,
he resumed courage, again avowed those opinions, and was, therefore, committed
to the flames on the 30th of May, 1416.</p>

<p>Before Huss and Jerome were condemned by the council, John Wycliffe,
who was considered, and not altogether without reason, as their teacher, had
been pronounced infamous, and condemned by a decree of the fathers. For
on the fourth day of May, 1415, the council declared a number of opinions
extracted from his writings to be abominable; and ordered all his books
to be destroyed, and his bones to be burned. Not long after, on the 14th
of June, they passed the famous decree that the sacred supper should be
administered to the laity under one kind of bread only, forbidding communion
under both kinds. For in the preceding year, 1414, Jacobellus
(James) of Mies, incumbent of St. Michael’s church at Prague, by the instigation
of a Parisian doctor, Peter of Dresden, had begun to celebrate the
communion under both kinds, at Prague; which example many other
churches followed. The subject being brought before the council by one of
the Bohemian bishops, it considered a remedy to be required even for this
heresy. By this decree at Constance, the communion of the laity under
one kind obtained the force and authority of law in the Roman church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1407-1431 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>In the same year, the council placed among execrable errors, or heresies,
an opinion of Jean Petit, a Parisian theologian, that tyrants might be lawfully
slain by any private person. The party however, from whom this opinion
came was not named, because he was supported by very powerful patrons.
John duke of Burgundy employed assassins, in the year 1407, to murder
Louis duke of Orleans. A great contest now arose, and Petit, an eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_637"></a>[637]</span>
and ingenious man, pleaded the cause of John of Burgundy at Paris; and in
order to justify his conduct he maintained that it is no sin to destroy a
tyrant, without a trial of his cause, by force or fraud, or in any other manner,
and even if the persons doing it are bound to him by an oath or covenant.
By a tyrant, however, Petit did not understand the sovereign of a nation,
but a powerful citizen, who abused his resources to the ruin of his king and
country. The university of Paris passed a stern and severe sentence upon
the author of so dangerous an opinion. The council, after several consultations,
struck at the opinion, without naming its author. The new pontiff,
however, Martin V, from fear of the Burgundian power, would not ratify
even this mild sentence.</p>

<p>After these and some other transactions the council proceeded avowedly
to the subject of a reformation of the church, in its “head and members,” as
the language of that age was. For all Europe saw the need of such a reformation,
and most ardently wished for it. Nor did the council deny that
chiefly for this important object it had been called together. But the cardinals
and principal men of the Romish court, for whose interest it was, especially,
that the disorders of the church should remain
untouched, craftily urged and brought
the majority to believe that a business of
such magnitude could not be managed advantageously,
until after the election of a
new pontiff. The new head of the church,
however, Martin V, abused his power to
elude the design of reformation; and manifested
by his commands and edicts that he
did not wish the church to be purged and
restored to a sound state. The council,
accordingly, after deliberating three years
and six months, broke up on the 22nd of
April, 1418, leaving the matter unaccomplished,
and putting off that reformation,
which all good men devoutly wished, to a
council which should be called five years
afterwards.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">[1431-1439 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Martin V, being admonished on the subject,
after a long delay appointed this other
council to be held at Pavia; and afterwards
removed it to Siena, and lastly to
Bâle. But at its very commencement, on
the 21st February, 1431, he died; and was
succeeded, in the month of March, by Gabriel
Condolmieri, a Venetian, and bishop
of Siena, who took the name of Eugenius
IV. He sanctioned all that Martin had
decreed about holding the council at Bâle;
and accordingly it commenced on the 23rd
of July, 1431, under the presidency of Cardinal
Julian, as representative of the pontiff. Two objects especially were
assigned to this celebrated council: first, a union between the Greeks and
the Latins; and secondly, the reformation of the church, both in its “head
and its members,” according to the resolution adopted in the Council of
Constance. Now that the head, namely the sovereign pontiff, and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638"></a>[638]</span>
the members of the church, that is the bishops, priests, and monks, were
in a very unsound state no one doubted. But when the fathers, by the
very form of the council, by its mode and order of proceeding, and by
its first decrees, showed an intention of performing in earnest what was
expected of them, Eugenius IV became uneasy for a corrupt church under
such physicians, and twice attempted to dissolve the council. This the
fathers most firmly resisted; and they showed by the decrees of the Council
of Constance, and by other arguments, that the council was superior
in authority to a pontiff. This first contest between the pontiff and the
council was brought to a close in the month of November, 1433; for the
pontiff silently gave up the point, and in the month of December, by letters
sent from Rome, gave the council his approbation.</p>

<p>After this the council prosecuted with energy the business upon which
it had entered. The legates of the Roman pontiff were now admitted; but
not until they had promised under oath to obey the decrees of the council,
and particularly the decrees of the Council of Constance, asserting the dominion
and jurisdiction of councils over the pontiffs. These very decrees of
Constance, so odious to the pontiffs, were renewed in a public meeting of the
fathers on the 26th of June, 1434. And on the 9th of June, 1435, annates,
as they were called, were abolished, the pontifical legates in vain opposing it.
On the 25th of March, 1436, a profession of faith was read, intended for the
pope himself on the day of his election. The number of cardinals was reduced
to twenty-four; and expectatives, reservations, and provisions were abolished.</p>

<p>Other things coming on little agreeable to the pontiff, Eugenius concluded
that this very audacious and troublesome council must either be
removed into Italy or be curbed by another council in opposition to it.
Therefore, when these fathers decreed, on May 7th, 1437, that on account
of the Greeks the council should be held either at Bâle, or Avignon, or in
some city of Savoy, the pontiff, on the contrary, by his legates, decided that
the council should be held in Italy. Neither party would revoke its decision.
Hence a violent conflict, from this time onward, existed between the pontiff
and the council. On the 26th of July, 1437, the council ordered the pontiff
to appear before them at Bâle, and give account of his conduct. The
pontiff, on the other hand, dissolved the council, and appointed another at
Ferrara. But the fathers, with the approbation of the emperor, the king
of France, and other princes, continued their deliberations at Bâle; and on
the 28th of September of the same year pronounced the pontiff contumacious
for not obeying the decree of a council.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January of the next year, 1438, Eugenius IV, in person,
opened the council which he had summoned to meet at Ferrara; and in the
second session of it excommunicated the fathers assembled at Bâle. The
chief business of this council was to negotiate a union between the Greeks
and Latins. The Greek emperor himself, Joannes Palæologus, the patriarch
of Constantinople, Joseph, and the principal theologians and bishops of the
nation had come personally to Italy, in order to facilitate the success of this
important negotiation. For the Greeks, now reduced to extremities by the
Turks, indulged the hope that if their disagreements with the Roman pontiff
were removed the Latins would afford them succour. The business proceeded
tardily, and with little success at Ferrara; but afterwards rather
better at Florence. For Eugenius in the beginning of the year 1439, on
account of the pestilence at Ferrara, had ordered the council to remove to
Florence. The fathers at Bâle, provoked by these and other acts of Eugenius,
proceeded on the 25th of June, 1439, to deprive him of the pontificate; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639"></a>[639]</span>
this bold procedure of theirs was not approved by the kings and princes of
Europe. Eugenius, on the 4th of September, by a very severe bull anathematised
the Basilian fathers and rescinded all their acts. Despising these
thunders, on the 17th of September, 1439, they elected a new pontiff, Amadeus,
duke of Savoy, who then led a retired life at Ripaille on the Leman
Lake (Lake of Geneva). He assumed the name of Felix V.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1439-1449 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Thus the lamentable schism, which had been extinguished after so much
labour and toil at Constance, returned with new and greater misfortunes.
For there were not only two pontiffs mutually condemning each other, but
likewise, what was worse, two opposing councils, that of Bâle and that of
Florence. The greater part of the church, indeed, adhered to Eugenius;
but most of the universities, and particularly the first among them, that of
Paris, as well as some kingdoms and provinces, chose to follow Felix V.
The Council of Bâle continued to deliberate and to pass laws and decrees till
the year 1443, notwithstanding all the opposition of Eugenius and his adherents.
And although the fathers separated in that year, they nevertheless
publicly declared that the council was not at an end, but would assemble again
at a proper time, either at Bâle, or Lyons, or Lausanne. The Council of
Florence was chiefly occupied in settling the disputes between the Latins and
the Greeks. This great business was committed to selected individuals of
both parties. The principal one on the part of the Greeks was Bessarion, a
very learned man, who was afterwards admitted into the order of cardinals
in the Roman church. This man, being gained by the favours bestowed on
him by the pontiff, exerted his influence, and the pontiff employed rewards,
threats, and promises to induce the other Greeks to accede to the proposed
terms of accommodation, and to acknowledge that the Holy Spirit proceeded
also from the Son, that departed souls undergo a purgation by fire before
they are admitted to the vision of God, that bread which is without leaven
may be used in the sacred supper, and lastly, what was most important of
all, that the Roman pontiff is the head and the judge of the church universal.
One of the Greeks, Mark of Ephesus, could not be persuaded, by entreaties
or by bribes, to give his assent. After all, this peace, which was extorted
by various artifices, was not stable. For the Greeks, on returning to Constantinople,
stated to their fellow-citizens that everything had been carried
at Florence by fraud, and they resumed their hostility. The Council of
Florence itself put an end to its deliberations on the 26th of April, 1442.
There were also negotiations in this council for bringing the Armenians,
and the Jacobites, but especially the Abyssinians, into union with the Romish
church; which were attended with the same result as those respecting the
Greeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1447-1455 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The author of this new pontifical schism, Eugenius IV, died in the
month of February, 1447, and was succeeded in the month of March by
Nicholas V, who was previously Tommaso Parentucelli of Sarzana, bishop
of Bologna, a man of learning himself and a great patron of learning, and
likewise moderate in temper and disposed for peace. Under him, by means
of the persevering labours and efforts of the kings and princes of Europe,
especially of the king of France, tranquillity was restored to the Latin
church. For Felix V, on the 9th of April, 1449, himself resigned the
supremacy of the church, and retired to his former quiet at Ripaille; and the
Basilian fathers, being assembled on the 16th of April at Lausanne, ratified
his voluntary abdication, and by a solemn decree directed the whole church
to obey Nicholas only. On the 18th of June Nicholas promulgated this
pacification; and, at the same time, confirmed by his sanction the acts and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640"></a>[640]</span>
decrees of the Council of Bâle. This Nicholas was particularly distinguished
for his love of literature and the arts, which he laudably exerted himself
to advance and encourage in Italy, especially by means of the Greeks that
came from Constantinople. He died on the 24th of March, 1455, principally
from grief, occasioned by the capture of Constantinople by the Turks.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4c3"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4c">c</a></span></p>

<p>At this date Milman closes his splendid work on <i>The History of Latin
Christianity</i>. It will be profitable to quote his summing up of the point
reached by Nicholas V, eight and a half centuries after Gregory the Great.<span class="enanchor"><a href="#papacy_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<h5>MILMAN ON NICHOLAS V AND THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPLE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1447-1458 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The pontificate of Nicholas V is the culminating point of Latin Christianity.
The papal power indeed had long reached its zenith. From Innocent
III to Boniface VIII it had begun its decline. But Latin Christianity
was alike the religion of the popes and of the councils which contested their
supremacy. It was as yet no more than a sacerdotal strife whether the pope
should maintain an irresponsible autocracy, or be limited and controlled by
an ubiquitous, aristocratic senate. The most ardent reformers looked no
further than to strengthen the hierarchy. The prelates were determined to
emancipate themselves from the usurpations of the pope, as to their elections,
their arbitrary taxation by Rome, the undermining of their authority by
perpetual appeals; but they had no notion of relaxing in the least the
ecclesiastical domination. It was not that Christendom might govern itself,
but that themselves might have a more equal share in the government.
They were as jealously attached as the pope to the creed of Latin Christianity.
The council, not the pope, burned John Huss. Their concessions to
the Bohemians were extorted from their fears, not granted by their liberality.
The Vulgate was their Bible, the Latin service their exclusive liturgy, the
Canon Law their code of jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Latin Christianity had yet to discharge some part of its mission. It had
to enlighten the world with letters, to adorn it with arts. It had hospitably to
receive (a gift fatal in the end to its own dominion) and to promulgate to
mankind the poets, historians, philosophers of Greece. It had to break down
its own idols, the schoolmen, and substitute a new idolatry, that of classical
literature. It had to perfect Christian art. Already Christian architecture
had achieved some of its wonders. The venerable Lateran and St. Paul’s
without the Walls, the old St. Peter’s, St. Mark’s at Venice and Pisa, Strasburg
and Cologne, Rheims and Bourges, York and Lincoln, stood in their
majesty. Christian painting, and even Christian sculpture, were to rise to
their untranscended excellence.</p>

<p>The choice of Nicholas V was one of such singular felicity for his time
that it cannot be wondered if his admirers looked on it as overruled by the
Holy Spirit. “Who would have thought in Florence,” so said Nicholas to
his biographer Vespasiano,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4e1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4e">e</a></span> “that a priest who rang the bells should become
supreme pontiff?” Yet it seems to have been a happy accident. In
Nicholas V, in three short years, the pope had become again a great Italian
potentate. The pilgrims carried back throughout Europe accounts of the
resuscitated majesty of the Roman pontificate, the unsullied personal dignity
of the pope, the re-enthronement of religion in the splendid edifices, which
were either building or under restoration. Nicholas V was to behold, as it
were, the final act of homage to the popedom, from the majesty of the empire.
He was to be the last pontiff who was to crown at Rome the successor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_641"></a>[641]</span>
Charlemagne; Frederick III the last emperor who was so to receive his
crown from the hands of the pope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">[1452-1455 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Now came that event which, however foreseen by the few wiser prophetic
spirits, burst on Europe and on Christendom with the stunning and appalling
effect of absolute suddenness&mdash;the taking of Constantinople by the
Turks. On no two European minds did this disaster work with more profound
or more absorbing terror than on Pope Nicholas V and Æneas Sylvius
(Enea Silvio Piccolomini); nor could anyone allege more sound reasons for
that terror than the pope and the bishop of Siena. Who could estimate
better than Æneas, from his intimate knowledge of all the countries of
Europe, of Italy, Germany, France, England, the extent of the danger which
impended over the Latin world? Never since its earlier outburst might
Mohammedanism seem so likely to subjugate if not to swallow up distracted
and disunited Christendom, as under the Turks. By sea and land they
were equally formidable. If Christendom should resist, on what frontier?
All were menaced, all in danger. What city, what kingdom, would arrest
the fierce, the perpetual invasion? From this period throughout the affairs
of Germany (at Frankfort he preached a crusade) to the end of his legatine
power, of his cardinalate, of his papacy, of his life, this was the one absorbing
thought, one passion, of Æneas Sylvius. The immediate advance of the
victorious Muhammed through Hungary, Dalmatia, to the border, the centre
of Italy, was stopped by a single fortress, Belgrade; by a preacher, John
Capistrano; by a hero, John Hunyady. But it was not till, above a century
later, when Don John of Austria, at Lepanto by sea, and John Sobieski,
before Vienna, by land, broke the spell of Mohammedan conquest, that
Europe or Christendom might repose in security.</p>

<p>The death of Nicholas V was hastened, it was said, by the taking of Constantinople.
Grief, shame, fear, worked on a constitution broken by the
gout. But Nicholas V foresaw not that in remote futurity the peaceful, not
the warlike, consequences of the fall of Constantinople would be most fatal
to the popedom&mdash;that what was the glory of Nicholas V would become
among the foremost causes of the ruin of mediæval religion; that it would aid
in shaking to the base and in severing forever the majestic unity of Latin
Christianity.</p>

<p>Nicholas V aspired to make Italy the domicile, Rome the capital, of
letters and arts. No sooner was Nicholas pope than he applied himself to
the foundation of the Vatican library. Five thousand volumes were speedily
collected. The wondering age boasted that no such library had existed
since the days of the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>The scholars of Italy flocked to Rome, each to receive his task from the
generous pope, who rewarded their labours with ample payment. He
seemed determined to enrich the West with all that survived of Grecian
literature. The fall of Constantinople, long threatened, had been preceded
by the immigration of many learned Greeks. France, Germany, even England,
the Byzantine Empire, Greece, had been ransacked by industrious
agents for copies of all the Greek authors. No branch of letters was without
its interpreters.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Pope of the Fifteenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>To Nicholas V, Italy, or rather Latin Christianity, mainly owes her age
of learning, as well as its fatal consequence to Rome and to Latin Christianity,
which in his honest ardour he would be the last to foresee. It was
the splendid vision of Nicholas V that this revival of letters, which in certain
circles became almost a new religion, would not be the bond-slave but
the handmaid or willing minister of the old. Latin Christianity was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_642"></a>[642]</span>
array itself in all the spoils of the ancient world, and so maintain (there was
nothing of policy in his thought) her dominion over the mind of man. But
Rome under Nicholas V was not to be the centre of letters alone; she was
also to resume her rank as the centre of art, more especially of architectural
magnificence. Rome was to be again as of old the lawgiver of civilisation;
pilgrims from all parts of the world, from curiosity, for business, or from
religion, were to bow down before the confessed
supremacy of her splendid works.</p>

<p>The pope was to be a great sovereign
prince, but above the sovereign prince he
was to be the successor of St. Peter. Rome
was to be at once the strong citadel, and
the noblest sanctuary in the world, unassailable
by her enemies both without and
within from her fortifications; commanding
the world to awe by the unrivalled
majesty of her churches. The Jubilee had
poured enormous wealth into the treasury
of the pope; his ordinary revenues, both
from the papal territory and from Christendom
at large, began to flow in with peace
and with the revival of his authority. That
wealth was all expended with the most liberal
magnificence. Already had it dawned
upon the mind of Nicholas V that the
cathedral of the chief of the apostles ought
to rival, or to surpass, all the churches in
Christendom in vastness and majesty. It
was to be entirely rebuilt from its foundations.
Julius II and Leo X did but accomplish
the design of Nicholas V.</p>

<p>Thus in Nicholas V closed one great age
of the papacy. In Nicholas the sovereign
Italian prince and the pontiff met in serene
and amicable dignity; he had no temptation
to found a princely family. But before
long the pontiff was to be lost in the sovereign
prince. Nor was it less evident
that the exclusive dominion of Latin Christianity was drawing to a close,
though nearly a century might elapse before the final secession of Teutonic
Christianity, and the great permanent division of Christendom. Each successive
pontificate might seem determined to advance, to hasten that still
slow but inevitable revolution: the audacious nepotism of Sixtus IV, the
wickednesses of Alexander VI, which defy palliation; the wars of Julius II,
with the hoary pope at the head of ferocious armies; the political intrigues
and disasters of Clement VII.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4b3"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4b">b</a></span></p>

<h5>POPES TO 1503</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1458-1503 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>Nicholas’ successor, Alfonso Borgia (Borja), a Spaniard, whose pontifical
name was Calixtus III, performed nothing great or splendid, if no account
be taken of his anxiety to urge Christian princes upon a war against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_643"></a>[643]</span>
Turks. He died in the year 1458. Much more celebrated was his successor,
Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini, bishop of Siena, who ascended the papal
throne in 1458, and took the name of Pius II, a man of superior genius, and
renowned both for his achievements and for his various writings and publications.</p>

<p>Yet posterity would have accounted him a much greater man, if he
had not been guilty of gross inconsistency. For after strenuously maintaining
the rights of councils against the pontiffs, and boldly defending the
cause of the Council of Bâle against Eugenius IV, upon being made pontiff,
he apostatised from himself; and January 18th, 1460, denied that a council
is superior to a pontiff, and severely prohibited appeals to councils; and in
the year 1461 obtained from Louis XI, king of France, the abrogation of the
pragmatic sanction, which was favourable to councils; and finally, April
26th, 1463, he expressed a public disapproval of all that he had himself
written in favour of the Council of Bâle, and decreed that Pius II was to be
heard and obeyed, but that Æneas Sylvius was to be condemned. A
short time after making this declaration he fell ill and died in the month of
July, 1464.</p>

<p>Paul II, previously Pietro Barbo, a Venetian, who was raised to the chair
of St. Peter in 1464, and died in 1471, performed some acts not unworthy of
commendation, at least according to the views of that age; but he also did
many things that are scarcely excusable, if they are so at all, among the
least important of which is that he made a jubilee year come once in every
twenty-five years, in 1470. Hence his reputation with posterity has remained
equivocal.</p>

<p>The subsequent pontiffs, Sixtus IV, previously Francesco Albescola
della Rovere, who died in 1484, and Innocent VIII,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> previously Giovanni
Battista Cibo, a Genoese, who died in 1492, were of the middle kind, being
distinguished as popes neither for great virtues nor for great faults. Each,
fearing for Italy and for all Europe, from the power of the Turks, both
prepared himself for a war upon them and very earnestly urged one on
the kings of Europe. But each met with such obstacles as disappointed
an object so dear to his heart. Nothing else was done by them with much
pretension to true greatness.</p>

<p>The pontifical series of this century is closed by Alexander VI, a Spaniard,
whose true name was Rodrigo Borgia. He may not improperly be called the
Nero of pontiffs. For the villainies, crimes, and enormities recorded of this
man are so many and so great as to make it seem clear that he was destitute,
we will not say of all religion, but even of decency and shame. Among the
things charged upon him, though some may be false and others overstated,
by his enemies, yet so many remain which are placed beyond all dispute as
are sufficient to render the memory of Alexander execrable in the view
of all who have even a moderate share of virtue. A large part of his crimes,
however, originated from his excessive partiality for his children; for he had
four sons by a concubine, among whom was the notorious Cesare Borgia,
infamous for his enormous vices, and likewise one daughter named Lucrezia;
and he was intent solely on bringing forward and enriching these, without
regarding honesty, reason, or religion.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4c4"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4c">c</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_644"></a>[644]</span></p>

<h5>ALEXANDER VI, THE BORGIA</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1492-1503 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>The great object of Alexander through his whole life was to gratify his
inclination for pleasure, his ambition, and his love of ease. When at length
he had attained to the supreme spiritual dignity, he seemed also to have
reached the summit of happiness. Spite of his advanced years, the exultation
he felt seemed daily to impart to him a new life. No painful thought was
permitted to disturb his repose for a single night. His only care was to
seize on all means that might aid him to increase his power, and advance the
wealth and dignity of his sons; on no other subject did he ever seriously
bestow a thought. This one consideration was at the base of all his political
alliances, and of those relations by which the events of the world were at
that time so powerfully influenced. How the pope would proceed, in regard
to the marriages, endowments, and advance of his children, became a question
affecting the politics of all Europe.</p>

<p>The son of Alexander, Cæsar Borgia, followed close on the footsteps of
Riario. He began from the same point, and his first undertaking was to
drive the widow of Riario from Imola and Forlì. He pressed forward to the
completion of his designs with the most daring contempt of consequences;
what Riario had only approached, or attempted, Cæsar Borgia carried
forward to its utmost results. Let us take a rapid glance at the means by
which his purposes were accomplished.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical states had hitherto been divided by the factions of the
Guelfs and Ghibellines, the first represented in Rome by the family of
Orsini, the second by the house of Colonna. The popes had usually taken
part with one or the other of these factions. Sixtus IV had done so, and his
example was followed by Alexander and his son, who at first attached themselves
to the Guelf, or Orsini party. This alliance enabled them very soon
to gain the mastery of all their enemies. They drove the house of Sforza
from Pesaro, that of Malatesta from Rimini, and the family of Manfredi from
Faenza. They seized on those powerful, well-fortified cities, and thus commenced
the foundation of an extensive lordship. But no sooner had they
attained this point, no sooner had they freed themselves from their enemies,
than they turned every effort against their friends. And it was in this that
the practice of the Borgias differed from that of their predecessors, who had
ever remained firmly attached to the party they had chosen; Cæsar, on the contrary,
attacked his own confederates, without hesitation or scruple. The duke
of Urbino, from whom he had frequently received important aid, was involved,
as in a network, by the machinations of Cæsar, and with difficulty saved his
life, a persecuted fugitive in his own dominions. Vitelli, Baglioni, and other
chiefs of the Orsini faction, resolved to show him that at least they were capable
of resistance. But Cæsar Borgia, declaring that “it is permitted to betray
those who are the masters of all treasons,” decoyed them into his snares with
profoundly calculated cruelty, and mercilessly deprived them of life. Having
thus destroyed both parties, he stepped into their place, gathered the inferior
nobility, who had been their adherents, around him, and took them into his
pay; the territories he had seized on were held in subjection by force of
terror and cruelty.</p>

<p>The brightest hopes of Alexander were thus realised&mdash;the nobles of the
land were annihilated, and his house about to found a great hereditary
dominion in Italy. But he had already begun to acquire practical experience
of the evil which passions, aroused and unbridled, are capable of
producing. With no relative or favourite would Cæsar Borgia endure the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_645"></a>[645]</span>
participation of his power. His own brother stood in his way; Cæsar
caused him to be murdered and thrown into the Tiber. His brother-in-law
was assailed and stabbed, by his orders, on the steps of his palace.
The wounded man was nursed by his wife and sister, the latter preparing
his food with her own hands to secure him from poison; the pope set a
guard upon the house to protect his son-in-law from his son. Cæsar
laughed these precautions to scorn. “What cannot be done at noonday,”
said he, “may be brought about in the evening.” When the prince was on
the point of recovery, he burst into his chamber, drove out the wife and sister,
called in the common executioner, and caused his unfortunate brother-in-law
to be strangled. Towards his father, whose life and station he valued
only as means to his own aggrandisement, he displayed not the slightest
respect or feeling. He slew Peroto, Alexander’s favourite, while the unhappy
man clung to his patron for protection, and was wrapped within the
pontifical mantle. The blood of the favourite flowed over the face of the pope.</p>

<p>For a certain time the city of the apostles, and the whole state of the church,
were in the hands of Cæsar Borgia. He is described as possessing great personal
beauty, and was so strong that in a bull-fight he would strike off the
head of the animal at a single blow; of liberal spirit, and not without certain
features of greatness, but given up to his passions, and deeply stained with
blood. How did Rome tremble at his name! Cæsar required gold, and
possessed enemies; every night were the corpses of murdered men found in
the streets, yet none dared move; for who but might fear that his own turn
would be next? Those whom violence could not reach were taken off by
poison. There was but one place on earth where such deeds were possible&mdash;that,
namely, where unlimited temporal power was united to the highest
spiritual authority, where the laws, civil and ecclesiastical, were held in one
and the same hand. This place was occupied by Cæsar Borgia. Even
depravity may have its perfection. The kindred of the popes have often
distinguished themselves in the career of evil, but none attained to the eminence
of Cæsar Borgia. He may be called a virtuoso in crime. Was it not
in the first and most essential tendencies of Christianity to render such a
power impossible? And yet, Christianity itself, and the very position of
the supreme head of the church, were made subservient to its existence.</p>

<p>There needed, then, no advent of a Luther, to prove to the world that
these things were in direct opposition to the spirit of Christianity. Even at
that time men complained that the pope was preparing the way for antichrist,
and labouring for the interest of Satan rather than the kingdom of
God. We do not follow the history of Alexander in its minute details.
He once purposed, as is but too well authenticated,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to destroy one of the
richest cardinals by poison; but the latter contrived to win over the pope’s
chief cook by means of promises, entreaties, and gifts. The confection, prepared
for the cardinal, was set before the pontiff himself; and Alexander
expired from the effects of that poison which he had destined for another.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4f1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4f">f</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Estimates of Alexander VI</i></h5>

<p>It is the pastime of historians to practise their technic impartially in
besmirching the sanctified reputations of the saints of popular belief and
in whitewashing the traditional villains. Alexander VI is too historic a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646"></a>[646]</span>
monster to escape the efforts of some apologist, and in recent years Dr.
Richard Garnett<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4g1"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4g">g</a></span> and Frederick Baron Corvo<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4i"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4i">i</a></span> have come to his rescue.
The former praises his great shrewdness, his learning and vigour, and finds
him no worse than his times, which is at best damning with faint praise one
who stood for St. Peter on earth. Dr. Garnett after his defence is however
compelled to admit the following flaws in the pope’s character:<span class="enanchor"><a href="#papacy_endnote_a">a</a></span></p>

<p>“Cardinal Borgia had simply bought up the Sacred College. Although
Alexander’s election was without question the most notorious of any for the
unscrupulous employment of illegitimate influences, it is difficult to affirm
that it was in principle more simoniacal than most of those which had lately
preceded it or were soon to follow. Men said that Alexander had bribed the
French ministers; probably he had. He had been tortuous, perfidious,
temporising under stress of circumstances. Unrestrained by moral scruples,
or by any spiritual conception of religion, he was betrayed into gross
sensuality of one kind, though in other respects he was temperate and
abstemious. In the more respectable guise of family affection it led him to
outrage every principle of justice. The general tendency of investigation,
which utterly shattering all idle attempts to represent him as the model pope,
has been to relieve him of the most odious imputations against his character.
There remains the charge of secret poisoning from motives of cupidity, which
indeed appear established, or nearly so, only in a single instance, but this may
imply others.”</p>

<p>In the same work Henry C. Lea<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4h"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4h">h</a></span> is more severe. “It is no wonder that
Rome had become a centre of corruption whence infection was radiated
throughout Christendom. In the middle of the fourteenth century Petrarch
exhausts his rhetoric in describing the abominations of the papal city of
Avignon, where everything was vile; and the return of the curia to Rome
transferred to that city the supremacy in wickedness. In 1499 the Venetian
ambassador describes it as the sewer of the world, and Machiavelli asserts
that through its example all devotion and all religion had perished in Italy.
In 1490 it numbered 6000 public women&mdash;an enormous proportion for a
population not exceeding 100,000. The story is well known, how Cardinal
Borgia, who, as vice-chancellor, openly sold pardons for crime, when reproved
for this, replied, that God desires not the death of sinners but that they
should pay and live. If the diary of Infessura<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4j"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4j">j</a></span> is suspect on account of
his partisanship, that of Burchard is unimpeachable, and his placid recital
of the events passing under his eyes presents to us a society too depraved
to take shame at its own wickedness. The public marriage, he says, of the
daughters of Innocent VIII and Alexander VI set the fashion for the clergy
to have children, and they diligently followed it; for all, from the highest to
the lowest, kept concubines, while the monasteries were brothels.”</p>

<p>And John Addington Symonds has been quite as emphatic:</p>

<p>“To describe him as the Genius of Evil, whose sensualities, as unrestrained
as Nero’s, were relieved against the background of flames and smoke
which Christianity had raised for fleshly sins, is justifiable. An epigram
gained currency: ‘Alexander sells the keys, the altars, Christ. Well, he
bought them; so he has a right to sell them.’ Having sold the scarlet to the
highest bidder, he used to feed his prelate with rich benefices. When he had
fattened him sufficiently, he poisoned him, laid hands upon his hoards, and
recommenced the game. His traffic in church dignities was carried on upon
a grand scale, twelve cardinals’ hats, for example, were put to auction in a
single day. This was when he wished to pack the conclave with votes in
favour of the cession of Romagna to Cesare Borgia. Carnal sensuality was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_647"></a>[647]</span>
the besetting vice of this pope throughout his life. His relations to Vanozza
Catanei and to Giulia Farnese were open and acknowledged. These two
sultanas ruled him during the greater portion of his career, conniving meanwhile
at the harem, which, after true oriental fashion, he maintained in the
Vatican.”<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4l"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4l">l</a></span></p>

<h5>JULIUS II</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1503-1513 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>A pope followed who made it his object to assume a position in direct
contrast with that of the Borgias; but who pursued the same end, though he
took different, and from that very circumstance successful, means for his
purpose. Julius II (1503-1513 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) enjoyed
the incalculable advantage of finding opportunity
for promoting the interests of his
family by peaceable means; he obtained for
his kindred the inheritance of Urbino. This
done, he could devote himself, undisturbed by
the importunities of his kindred, to the gratification
of that innate love for war and conquest
which was indeed the ruling passion
of his life. To this he was invited by the
circumstances of the times, and the consciousness
of his eminent position; but his
efforts were all for the church&mdash;for the benefit
of the papal see. Other popes had laboured
to procure principalities for their sons or their
nephews; it was the ambition of Julius to
extend the dominions of the church. He
must, therefore, be regarded as the founder
of the papal states.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p647.jpg" width="200" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Friar of the Sixteenth Century</span></p>
</div>

<p>He found the whole territory in extreme
confusion; all who had escaped by flight
from the hand of Cæsar had returned&mdash;the
Orsini, the Colonna, the Vitelli and Baglioni,
Varani, Malatesta, and Montefeltri&mdash;everywhere
throughout the whole land were the
different parties in movement; murderous
contests took place in the very Borgo of Rome.
Pope Julius has been compared with the Neptune
of Virgil, when rising from the waves,
with peace-inspiring countenance he hushes
their storms to repose. By prudence and
good management he disembarrassed himself even of Cæsar Borgia, whose
castles he seized and of whose dukedom he also gained possession. The
lesser barons he kept in order with the more facility from the measures to
this effect that had been taken by Cæsar, but he was careful not to give them
such cardinals for leaders as might awaken the ancient spirit of insubordination
by ambitious enterprise. The more powerful nobles, who refused him
obedience, he attacked without further ceremony. His accession to the papal
throne sufficed to reduce Baglioni (who had again made himself master of
Perugia) within the limits of due subordination. Nor could Bentivoglio offer
effectual resistance when required to resign that sumptuous palace which he
had erected in Bologna, and whereon he had too hastily inscribed the well-known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_648"></a>[648]</span>
eulogy of his own good fortune; of this he saw himself deprived in
his old age. The two powerful cities of Perugia and Bologna were thus
subjected to the immediate authority of the pontifical throne.</p>

<p>But with all this, Julius was yet far from having accomplished the end he
had proposed to himself. The coasts of the papal states were in great part
occupied by the Venetians; they were by no means disposed to yield possession
of them freely, and the pope was greatly their inferior in military
power. He could not conceal from himself that his attacking them would
be the signal for a commotion throughout Europe. Should he venture to
risk this?</p>

<p>Old as Julius now was, worn by the many vicissitudes of good and evil
fortune experienced through a long life; by the fatigues of war and exile, and
most of all by the consequences of intemperance and licentious excess, he yet
knew not what fear or irresolution meant; in the extremity of age, he still
retained that grand characteristic of manhood, an indomitable spirit. He felt
little respect for the princes of his time, and believed himself capable of mastering
them all. He took the field in person, and having stormed Mirandola,
he pressed into the city across the frozen ditches and through the breach; the
most disastrous reverses could not shake his purpose, but rather seemed to
waken new resources within him. He was accordingly successful; not only
were his own baronies rescued from the Venetians, but in the fierce contest
that ensued, he at length made himself master of Parma, Piacenza, and even
Reggio, thus laying the foundation of a power such as no pope had ever
possessed before him. From Piacenza to Terracina the whole fair region
admitted his authority.</p>

<h5>PREVALENCE OF SECULARISM IN THE CHURCH</h5>

<div class="sidenote">[1471-1503 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>]</div>

<p>It was an inevitable consequence that the whole body of the hierarchy
should be influenced by the character and tendencies of its chief, that
all should lend their best aid to the promotion of his purposes, and be themselves
carried forward by the impulse thus given. Not only the supreme
dignity of the pontiff, but all other offices of the church, were regarded as
mere secular property. The pope nominated cardinals from no better motive
than personal favour, the gratification of some potentate, or even, and
this was no unfrequent occurrence, for actual payment of money! Could
there be any rational expectation that men so appointed would fulfil their
spiritual duties? One of the most important offices of the church, the Penitenziaria,
was bestowed by Sixtus IV on one of his nephews. This office
held a large portion of the power of granting dispensations; its privileges
were still further extended by the pope, and in a bull issued for the express
purpose of confirming them, he declares all who shall presume to doubt
the rectitude of such measures, to be a “stiff-necked people and children of
malice.” It followed as a matter of course that the nephew considered his
office as a benefice, the proceeds of which he was entitled to increase to the
utmost extent possible.</p>

<p>A large amount of worldly power was at this time conferred in most
instances, together with the bishoprics; they were held more or less as sinecures
according to the degree of influence or court favour possessed by the
recipient or his family. The Roman curia thought only of how it might
best derive advantage from the vacancies and presentations; Alexander
extorted double annates or first-fruits, and levied double, nay triple tithes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_649"></a>[649]</span>
there remained few things that had not become matter of purchase. The
taxes of the papal chancery rose higher from day to day, and the comptroller,
whose duty it was to prevent all abuses in that department, most commonly
referred the revision of the imposts to those very men who had fixed their
amount. For every indulgence obtained from the datary’s office, a stipulated
sum was paid; nearly all the disputes occurring at this period between the
several states of Europe and the Roman court arose out of these exactions,
which the curia sought by every possible means to increase, while the people
of all countries as zealously strove to restrain them.</p>

<p>Principles such as these necessarily acted on all ranks affected by the
system based on them, from the highest to the lowest. Many ecclesiastics
were found ready to renounce their bishoprics; but they retained the greater
part of the revenues, and not unfrequently the presentation to the benefices
dependent on them also. Even the laws forbidding the son of a clergyman
to procure induction to the living of his father, and enacting that no ecclesiastic
should dispose of his office by will, were continually evaded; for as all
could obtain permission to appoint whomsoever he might choose as his coadjutor,
provided he were liberal of his money, so the benefices of the church
became in a manner hereditary. It followed of necessity that the performance
of ecclesiastical duties was grievously neglected. In this rapid sketch,
we confine ourselves to remarks made by conscientious prelates of the Roman
court itself.</p>

<p>In all places incompetent persons were intrusted with the performance of
clerical duties; they were appointed without scrutiny or selection. The
incumbents of benefices were principally interested in finding substitutes at
the lowest possible cost, thus the mendicant friars were frequently chosen as
particularly suitable in this respect. These men occupied the bishoprics under
the title (previously unheard of in that sense) of suffragans; the cures
they held in the capacity of vicars. Already were the mendicant orders in
possession of extraordinary privileges, and these had been yet further extended
by Sixtus IV, who was himself a Franciscan. They had the right of
confessing penitents, administering the Lord’s Supper, and bestowing extreme
unction, as also that of burying within the precincts, and even in the habit
of the order. All these privileges conferred importance as well as profit,
and the mendicant friars enjoyed them in their utmost plenitude; the pope
even threatened the disobedient secular clergy, or others, who should molest
the orders, more particularly as regarded bequests, with the loss of their
respective offices.</p>

<p>The administration of parishes as well as that of bishoprics being now
in the hands of the mendicant orders, it is manifest that they must have
possessed enormous influence. The higher offices and more important dignities
were monopolised, together with their revenues, by the great families
and their dependants, shared only with the favourites of courts and of the
curia; the actual discharge of the various duties was confided to the mendicant
friars who were upheld by the popes. They took active part also in
the sale of indulgences, to which so unusual an extension was given at that
time, Alexander VI being the first to declare officially that they were capable
of releasing souls from purgatory. But the orders also had fallen into
the extreme of worldliness. What intrigues were set on foot among them
for securing the higher appointments! what eagerness was displayed at elections
to be rid of a rival, or of a voter believed unfavourable! The latter
were sent out of the way as preachers or as inspectors of remote parishes;
against the former, they did not scruple to employ the sword, or the dagger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_650"></a>[650]</span>
and many were destroyed by poison. Meanwhile the comforts men seek
from religion became mere matter of sale; the mendicant friars, employed
at miserably low wages, caught eagerly at all contingent means of making
profit.</p>

<p>While the populace had sunk into almost heathen superstition, and
expected their salvation from mere ceremonial observances, but half understood,
the higher classes were manifesting opinions of a tendency altogether
anti-religious. How profoundly astonished must Luther have been, on visiting
Italy in his youth! At the very moment when the sacrifice of the mass
was completed, did the priests utter blasphemous words in denial of its
reality! It was even considered characteristic of good society, in Rome, to
call the principles of Christianity in question. “One passes,” says P. Ant.
Bandino,<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4m"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4m">m</a></span> “no longer for a man of cultivation, unless one put forth heterodox
opinions regarding the Christian faith.” At court, the ordinances of
the Catholic church, and of passages from Holy Scripture, were made subjects
of jest&mdash;the mysteries of the faith had become matter of derision.</p>

<p>We thus see how all is enchained and connected&mdash;how one event calls
forth another. The pretensions of temporal princes to ecclesiastical power
awaken a secular ambition in the popes, the corruption and decline of religious
institutions elicit the development of a new intellectual tendency, till
at length the very foundations of the faith become shaken in the public
opinion.<span class="enanchor" id="papacy_enanchor_4f2"><a href="#papacy_endnote_4f">f</a></span></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
